assessments were prepared by glj in accordance with the definitions standards and procedures contained in the cogeh and ni  contingent resource is defined in the cogeh as those quantities of petroleum estimated as of a given date to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources or that vermilion will produce any portion of the volumes currently classified as contingent resources the estimates of contingent resources involve implied assessment based on certain estimates and assumptions that the resources described exists in the quantities predicted or estimated as at a given date and that the resources can be profitably produced in the future the risked net present value of the future net revenue from the contingent resources does not necessarily represent the fair market value of the contingent resources actual contingent resources and any volumes that may be reclassified as reserves and future production therefrom may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein    glj prepared the estimates of contingent resources shown for each property using deterministic principles and methods probabilistic aggregation of the low and high property estimates shown in the table might produce different total volumes than the arithmetic sums shown in the table     the forecast price and cost assumptions utilized in the yearend  reserves report were also utilized by glj in preparing the contingent resource assessments see glj december   forecast prices in vermilions annual information form for the year ended december      gross contingent resources are vermilions working interest operating or nonoperating share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty interests of vermilion  net contingent resources are vermilions working interest operating or nonoperating share after deduction of royalty obligations plus vermilions royalty interests in contingent resources    the risked net present value of future net revenue attributable to the contingent resources does not necessarily represent the fair market value of the contingent resources estimated abandonment and reclamation costs have been included in the evaluation    this is considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate if probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  percent probability p that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the low estimate    this is considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate if probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  percent probability p that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate    this is considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered it is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate if probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  percent probability p that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the high estimate    the chance of development codev is the estimated probability that once discovered a known accumulation will be commercially developed five factors have been considered in determining the codev as follows codev  ps economic factor × ps technology factor × ps development plan factor ×ps development timeframe factor × ps other contingency factor wherein ps is the probability of success economic factor  for reserves to be assessed a project must be economic with respect to contingent resources this factor captures uncertainty in the assessment of economic status principally due to uncertainty in cost estimates and marketing options economic viability uncertainty due to technology is more aptly captured with the technology factor the economic factor will be  for reserves and will often be  for development pending and for projects with a development study or predevelopment study with a robust rate of return a robust rate of return means that the project retains economic status with variation in costs andor marketing plans over the expected range of outcomes for these variables technology factor  for reserves to be assessed a project must utilize established technology with respect to contingent resources this factor captures the uncertainty in the viability of the proposed technology for the subject reservoir namely the uncertainty associated with technology under development by definition technology under development is a recovery process or process improvement that has been determined to be technically viable via field test and is being field tested further to determine its economic viability in the subject reservoir the technology factor will be  for reserves and for established technology for technology under development this factor will consider different risks associated with technologies being developed at the scale of the well versus the scale of a project and technologies which are being modified or extended for the subject reservoir versus new emerging technologies which have not previously been applied in any commercial application the risk assessment will also consider the quality and sufficiency of the test data available the ability to reliably scale such data and the ability to extrapolate results in time development plan factor  for reserves to be assessed a project must have a detailed development plan with respect to contingent resources this factor captures the uncertainty in the project evaluation scenario the development plan factor will be  for reserves and high approaching  for development pending projects this factor will consider development plan detail variations including the degree of delineation reservoir specific development and operating strategy detail technology decision well layouts spacing and pad locations completion strategy startup strategy water source and disposal other infrastructure facility design marketing plans etc and the quality of the cost estimates as provided by the developer development timeframe factor  in the case of major projects for reserves to be assessed first major capital spending must be initiated within  years of the effective date the development timeframe factor will be  for reserves and will often be  for development pending provided the project is planned onstream based on the same criteria used in the assessment of reserves with respect to contingent resources the factor will approach  for projects planned onstream with a timeframe slightly longer than the limiting reserves criteria other contingency factor  for reserves to be assessed all contingencies must be eliminated with respect to contingent resources this factor captures major contingencies usually beyond the control of the operator other than those captured by economic status technology status project evaluation scenario status and the development timeframe the other contingency factor will be  for reserves and for development pending and less than  for on hold provided all contingencies have been identified and their resolution is reasonably certain this factor would also be  for development unclarified these factors may be interrelated dependent and care has been taken to ensure that risks

the basis of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel equivalent of oil  barrels of oil equivalent boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation  a boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the

be comparable with the calculations of similar measures for other entities fund flows from operations represents cash flows from operating activities before changes in noncash operating working capital and asset retirement obligations settled management considers fund flows from operations and fund flows from operations per share to be key measures as they demonstrate vermilions ability to generate the cash necessary to pay dividends repay debt fund asset retirement obligations and make capital investments management believes that by excluding the temporary impact of changes in noncash operating working capital fund flows from operations provides a useful measure of vermilions ability to generate cash that is not subject to shortterm movements in noncash operating working capital recycle ratio means a measure of capital efficiency calculated by dividing the operating netback of production by the cost of adding reserves netbacks are per boe and per mcf measures used in

edgar at wwwsecgovedgarshtml and on vermilions website at wwwvermilionenergycom highlights average production increased by  in q  to  boed as compared to  boed in the prior quarter this increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes in canada from the resumption of voluntarily curtailed natural gas production and organic growth from development activities as well as incremental volumes from our german acquisition which closed on december   we expect production volumes to continue increasing throughout  to achieve our full year production guidance of between  to  boed fund flows from operations ffo for q  was  million basic share as compared to  million basic share in q  this  decrease in ffo quarteroverquarter is primarily attributable to a significant inventory build in france and australia related to shipment timing the pretax ffo impact of the quarteroverquarter change in inventory levels was approximately  million based on anticipated shipment schedules we expect that this inventory build will reverse over the course of the year unwinding the ffo impact yearoveryear ffo increased by  as compared to q  as a result of significantly higher commodity prices production from corrib averaged  mmcfd  boed in q  representing  of rated plant capacity the project has continued to outperform expectations relating to well deliverability and downtime due to expected higher recovery efficiency resulting from better well communication we have adjusted our field and well performance estimates and now expect to maintain peak production plateau through q  and potentially

not be comparable to other companies  please see the nongaap financial measures section of managements discussion and analysis message to shareholders in early april vermilion held an investor day in paris france to provide investors and analysts with an opportunity to learn more about our companys strategy and global asset portfolio  the event featured presentations from members of our executive team and senior leaders from each of vermilions business units  our investor day was designed to achieve three main objectives provide a more detailed description of our assets and projects demonstrate the technical and management capabilities of vermilions global operations leadership team and emphasize the similarity of our overseas operations to north american operations through a field tour of our paris basin assets  a copy of the investor day presentation and a replay of the webcast is available on our website at httpwwwvermilionenergycomireventspresentationscfm it was fitting that vermilions first investor day event in nearly seven years coincided with the th anniversary of our first international acquisition  it was in  that vermilion took the innovative step of expanding internationally by acquiring producing properties in france  since then we have continued to strengthen and diversify our global asset portfolio maintaining a disciplined focus on our three core regions of north america europe and australia  as was demonstrated throughout our investor day event vermilions diversification has played a key role in our historical success and remains instrumental to our growthandincome model in the future project inventory diversity vermilions diversified inventory of conventional and semiconventional projects provides several competitive advantages for our company  diversification in commodity and price exposures allows us to select and invest in those projects that will generate the highest return for a given commodity price environment  in addition our focus on conventional and semiconventional projects results in lower production decline rates as compared to our north american competitors that focus on shales or other ultratight reservoirs  these lower decline rates significantly reduce our ongoing capital requirements and directly support the sustainability of our growthandincome model  at the same time we continue to apply the best worldwide drilling and completion technologies to our conventional and semiconventional assets to further enhance our rates of return  while we are focused on conventional and semiconventional projects our inventory depth is more typical of an unconventional producer  we have greatly expanded our project inventory over the past five years and it is stronger now than at any point in vermilions history after more than two years of depressed industry activity we are starting to see a modest recovery in activity levels as global oil markets begin to rebalance  while this increased activity will lead to service cost reflation we expect this to have less impact on vermillion than our competitors  a majority of our capital is directed to assets outside of north america where the services sector has not been exposed to severe boomandbust cycles  as such cost escalation pressures on our international operations are expected to be less significant  further our semiconventional asset base in north america requires significantly less sand water and horsepower intensity in completions as compared to our shale and ultratight focused competitors  as a result we have relatively less exposure to the pressure pumping services segment where services price reflation is expected to be most significant  capital investment and production source flexibility our diversification provides significant flexibility to reallocate capital and production amongst business units as required to meet corporate targets  this flexibility was recently demonstrated through the reallocation of  capital and production targets due to the permitting delays in the netherlands noted in our yearend  release and investor day materials  as discussed in the european review section below we now project that these permitting delays will result in the deferral of nearly  boed of netherlands production for  versus our original plan  in response we have reallocated a modest amount of additional capital from the netherlands to canada and intend to offset this currentyear permittingrelated production shortfall through increased production in other jurisdictions primarily canada and australia  our expectation to maintain our  production guidance of  –  boed despite the impact of these permitting delays and without increasing consolidated exploration and development ed capital demonstrates a key advantage of our diversification as well as the operational strength of our company risk reduction and premium pricing our global asset portfolio provides commodity diversification and premium pricing  commodity diversification reduces risk for our shareholders by increasing the stability of our cash flows and providing additional hedging options  approximately  of our oilequivalent  estimated production is priced with reference to dated brent and european natural gas benchmarks  these commodities continue to trade at significant premiums as compared to their north american counterparts improving our margins  our commodity exposure advantages coupled with our focus on cost management have allowed vermilion to consistently deliver top quartile netbacks within our peer group summary vermilions diversification has been a key element of our historical success and consistent record of market outperformance  our global asset portfolio generates significant free cash flow while at the same time delivering consistent production growth allowing us to sustainably deliver our growthandincome model for our shareholders  our focus on three core regions managed within a decentralized business unit structure with a highly capable leadership team allows us to focus our efforts and effectively manage our global asset base  in each region we are a very technicallyfocused company that continues to add real value through high quality technical work and careful execution of our projects   q  review vermilions first quarter production increased by  to  boed from  boed in the prior quarter  this increase was primarily attributable to higher volumes in canada related to the resumption of voluntarily curtailed production and organic growth from development activities as well as incremental volumes from our german acquisition which closed near the end of last year  we expect production volumes to continue increasing throughout  with production volumes averaging between  to  boed for the year fund flows from operations ffo for q  was  million basic share as compared to  million basic share in q   this  decrease in ffo quarteroverquarter is primarily attributable to a significant inventory build in france and australia related to shipment timing  the pretax ffo impact of the quarteroverquarter change in inventory levels was approximately  million  based on anticipated shipment schedules we expect that this inventory build will reverse over the course of the year unwinding the ffo impact yearoveryear ffo increased by  as compared to q  as a result of significantly higher commodity prices  vermilion generated net earnings of  million basic share during the first quarter representing a return to positive net income for the first time since q  while commodity prices have increased from the lows experienced in  we continue to maintain our strict focus on cost management  perunit operating expense of  per boe decreased by  during q  as compared to the prior quarter and by  as compared to the yearearlier quarter during the quarter we issued us million of eightyear senior unsecured notes at a coupon of  per annum  this issuance was completed by way of a private offering and represented vermilions first issuance in the us debt markets  despite vermilions firsttime issuer status we were able to secure a very attractive interest rate reflecting our track record of prudent fiscal management  the issuance of us dollar denominated debt provides a natural hedge against our largely us dollar denominated revenue streams  subsequent to the quarter we negotiated an extension of our credit facility with our banking syndicate to may   as a result of our projected liquidity requirements and the proceeds from this debt issuance we elected to reduce our bank facility to  billion from  billion effective with the april  dividend payment the allowable participation in the premium dividendtm component of our premium dividendtm and dividend reinvestment plan is now being prorated by   as such eligible shareholders who have elected to participate in the premium dividendtm component now receive a  premium on  of their participating shares and the regular cash dividend on the remaining  of their shares  we plan to discontinue the premium dividendtm component of our premium dividendtm and dividend reinvestment plan beginning with the july  dividend payment such that there would be no further equity issuance under this program  we also reduced the discount associated with the traditional component of our premium dividendtm and dividend reinvestment plan from  to  beginning with the january  dividend  europe production from corrib averaged  mmcfd  boed in q  representing  of rated plant capacity  the project has continued to outperform expectations for well deliverability and downtime  due to expected higher recovery efficiency resulting from better welltowell communication we have adjusted our field and well performance estimates and now expect to maintain peak production plateau through q  and potentially into q   corrib is a highly efficient generator of free cash flow as a result of its highlyvalued european gas product absence of royalties low operating expense and low maintenance capital requirements in france we drilled and completed our first wells in the neocomian fields during q   initial results from this four  net horizontal well program are highly encouraging  the first well was placed on production in early march and delivered an ip rate of  bblsd versus our type curve expectations of  bblsd  the second well which only has a completed horizontal section of  of the anticipated length due to drilling problems was placed on production in late march at a rate of approximately  bblsd at low drawdown during the initial production phase  the production rate from this well is expected to increase as pump displacement and drawdown are turned up over time  the remaining two wells have now been successfully drilled and cased with slotted liner through the full horizontal section targeted  reservoir quality indications from these two wells were positive and we expect to have them on production during the second quarter  during the first quarter we also completed and placed on production the four  net champotran wells we drilled in france in q   all wells are productive with two exceeding expectations and two below  the combined ip oil rate from the four wells was  bblsd  lastly we drilled and placed a vulaines horizontal sidetrack well on production during the quarter  the well delivered an ip rate of  bblsd prior to finishing the completion by acidizing the horizontal lateral  our ability to successfully execute a sidetracked horizontal lateral in vulaines creates the opportunity for higher productivity multilateral horizontal development from existing wellbores as noted previously permitting delays in the netherlands have resulted in a reallocation of capital and production targets amongst business units  due to the delays in receiving final production permits for three of our wells two wells are now producing at significantly restricted rates and a third well has been shutin while we believe the final production permits for one of the wells will be received in  we do not currently expect to receive the permits for the other two wells until   as such we have reduced our full year  average production forecast for the netherlands to approximately  boed  this compares to our initial  netherlands production plan of  boed which reflected our prior permitting timeline assumptions  we intend to offset lower netherlands volumes through increased production in other jurisdictions primarily canada and australia and have made no changes to our  guidance targets for consolidated production or ed capital  in the netherlands two  net wells that were in our original budget have been postponed and we have deferred the completion activities for the remaining two  net exploration wells that we intend to drill this year to   in addition we have reduced the scope of our planned seismic program in the akkrum exploration concession  further information on these changes is included in our may  investor presentation available on our website  we expect the curtailed netherlands volumes to be available for production during  in germany vermilion assumed operatorship of the assets acquired near the end of  from engie ep deutschland gmbh  production from the acquired assets averaged approximately  boed during the quarter  vermilion commenced service rig operations on the acquired assets in february and we have developed a work plan to implement identified optimization and workover projects  in march  we were awarded an exploration license in lower saxony comprising  gross acres  acres net to vermilion surrounding the acquired oil fields  the engie acquisition our assumption of production operatorship and the additional exploration acreage further advance our objective of developing a material business unit in germany  north america in canada capital activity increased significantly during the first quarter as compared to q of the prior year  during q  we drilled or participated in seven  net mannville wells five  net cardium wells and   net midale wells  eleven  net mannville wells two  net cardium wells and eight  net midale wells were brought on production  individual well results from our q  mannville program exceeded our expectations with the majority displaying test productivity significantly above our average well performance todate  lower mannville wells tested during the quarter include one well that tested at  mmcfd with  bblsd of free liquids and a second well at  mmcfd with  bblsd of free liquids  based on early stage production results oil rates from our cardium and midale wells are inline with expectations while cost efficiencies continue to improve  cardium drill complete equip and tiein dcet well costs averaged  million on a persection basis for q  as compared to  million during our last program in   per well costs for our midale play decreased to  million during q  from  million in   these improvements largely resulted from an approximately  decrease in required drilling days achieved during the quarter as compared to the start in the midale play in   the last five wells at the end of the q  program achieved a further  reduction in drilling days  during q we also continued to advance an infrastructure project supporting the continued growth of our upper mannville development in the ferrier area  we plan to start the construction of a  mmcfd compressor station in q  with startup scheduled for q                                                                                                                                   in the united states we drilled three  net wells in our early stage turner sand play during the quarter  the q  program was designed to establish consistent drilling and completion procedures while reducing drilling times and overall capital costs  drilling times were reduced to  days from the previous  day average despite an approximately  increase in average lateral length  based on currently available data while recognizing that some additional completion costs may still be incurred on the new wells we project that the per well drilling and completion capital cost was reduced by approximately  from the previous program  two of the three wells have been completed and were placed on production in late march while the third well is expected to be on production by late april  the first two wells have been produced intermittently so far with initial production performance that is comparable to the better wells drilled thus far in our east finn project area  during q  we purchased overriding royalty interests on our lands ranging from  to  for us million further consolidating our position and enhancing our play economics australia activities in australia were largely centered around our debottlenecking project to further improve fluid handling capability on the wandoo b platform  once completed we expect that this infrastructure enhancement will allow us to increase oil production on the platform by  to  bblsd later in   the two sidetrack wells we drilled in q  continue to exhibit strong productive capability  when utilized combined oil production from these wells was approximately  bblsd during q   these wells are produced intermittently to achieve business unit targets and meet oil sales contract commitments  we do not expect to drill additional wells in australia until  environmental social  governance
