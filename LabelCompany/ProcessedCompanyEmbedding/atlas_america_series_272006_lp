atlas america series  lp we us or the partnership is a delaware limited partnership formed on july   with atlas resources llc serving as its managing general partner and operator atlas resources or mgp atlas resources is an indirect subsidiary of atlas resource partners lp arp arp  we have drilled and currently operate wells located in new york pennsylvania and tennessee we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy lp atlas energy for administrative services we do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold we expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling overview the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce primarily natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and or thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as · well tending routine maintenance and adjustment · reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and · preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of september   our mgp had not withheld any funds for this purpose markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry

general partner and operator atlas resources or the mgp atlas resources is an indirect subsidiary of atlas resource partners lp arp arp  on february   the mgps ultimate parent atlas energy lp atlas energy which was a publicly traded masterlimited partnership was acquired by targa resources corp and distributed to atlas energys unitholders  of the limited liability company interests in arps general partner atlas energy group llc atlas energy group nyse atls atlas energy group became a separate publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the mgp as a result of the distribution following the distribution atlas energy group continues to manage arps operations and activities through its ownership of arps general partner interest we have drilled and currently operate wells located in new york pennsylvania and tennessee we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy group february   and prior atlas energy for administrative services we intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold we expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling overview the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce primarily natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated andor thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as � well tending routine maintenance and adjustment � reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and � preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of september   our mgp has withheld  of net production revenues for this purpose markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and the first nine months of  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry results of operations the following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues volumes sales

bbl  average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after adjusting for the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges  average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period previously recognized derivative gains were  and  for the three and nine months ended september   respectively  the average sales price and production costs as a percentage of revenues for natural gas for the three months ended september   has been adjusted to reflect  of additional revenue natural gas revenues during the quarter ended september   management identified an error in the process used to estimate our unbilled revenue as a result natural gas revenue for the three months ended september   includes an adjustment to reduce natural gas revenue by  the adjustment is the result of overstating our unbilled revenues as of june   refer to the partnerships form q for the quarter ended september   for further explanation of this error our unadjusted natural gas revenues were  and  for the three months ended september   and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended september   as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a  decrease in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges which were driven by market conditions and a  decrease in production volumes our production volumes

limited oil production our oil revenues were  and  for the three months ended september   and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in oil revenues for the three months ended september   as

comprehensive income within partners capital on our balance sheet will be reclassified to our statements of operations in the future at the time the originally hedged physical transactions settle we recognized a gain on marktomarket derivatives of  for the three months ended september   this gain was due primarily to marktomarket gains in the current quarter primarily related to the change in

expenses were  and  for the nine months ended september   and  respectively a decrease of   the decreases for the three and nine months ended september   were mostly due to a decrease in transportation costs due to a decrease in the realized price of natural gas and a decrease in the number of producing wells due to wells shutin as a result of a decline in natural gas prices depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was  and  for the three months ended september   and  respectively and  and  for the nine months ended september   and  respectively these percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues oil and gas reserve quantities product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas

respectively an increase of   these expenses include thirdparty costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our mgp the changes for the three and nine months ended september   are primarily due to thirdparty costs as compared to the prior year similar period impairment of gas and oil properties for the three and nine months ended september   was  there were no impairments of gas and oil properties for the three and nine months ended september   periodically we compare the carrying value of our proved developed gas and oil producing properties to their estimated fair market value to the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value an impairment charge is recognized as a result of this assessment an impairment charge was recognized for the three and nine months ended september   this charge is based on reserve quantities future market prices and our carrying value we cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities decreased  in the nine months ended september   to cash used in operating activities of  as compared to cash provided by operating activities of  for the nine months ended september   this decrease was mostly due to a decrease in net loss income before depletion accretion impairment and a

may challenge the partnerships ability to pay its obligations as they become due and its intention to produce its wells until they are depleted as they may become uneconomical to produce accordingly the mgp determined that there is substantial doubt about the partnerships ability to continue as a going concern the mgp has planned as necessary to continue the partnerships operations and to fund
