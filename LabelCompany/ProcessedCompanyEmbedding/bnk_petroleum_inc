petroleum faqglobal assetsphoto gallerieshydraulic stimulationmultimedia centercareers recovery methods the main ingredient in natural gas is methane which is formed when organic material derived from the breakdown of plants and animals is included in sedimentary deposits over time the sedimentary deposits change to rock and the included organic material gets changed into fossil fuel as either coal oil or natural gas the type of fossil fuel that is developed depends on both the original composition of the organic material and the temperature and pressure that it has been exposed to deep in the earth shale gas is defined as natural gas from a fine grained rock known as shale the shale acts as the source reservoir and seal for the natural gas older shale gas wells were usually vertical while more recent wells are primarily horizontal and are stimulated to produce gas by hydraulic fracturing only shale formations with certain characteristics will produce gas the most significant trend in us natural gas production is the rapid rise in production from shale formations shale gas deposits are usually classified as “continuous” type gas accumulations often extending throughout large areas this means once the resource is proven in an area low risk development is possible over a large area a key element in the emergence of shale gas production has been the refinement of costeffective horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies these two processes along with the implementation of protective environmental management practices have allowed shale gas development to produce gas from previously unproductive areas technology drives the exploration and production of shale gas which is comprised of either vertical or horizontal wells in both cases fresh water aquifers are protected by the use of casing and cement effectively isolating them from the deeper intervals most shale gas plays involve horizontal well completions to optimize recovery and well economics horizontal drilling has a big advantage over its vertical cousin in that a large amount of the wellbore can come into contact with the reservoir this also means that far fewer wells need to be drilled and the wells that are drilled can have many wells drilled from the same well pad site thus reducing surface impact the second critical element to the success of shale gas exploration and production is the use of hydraulic fracturing this process involves the injection of mainly water and sand or a similar “proppant” into a shale formation to generate fractures or cracks in the target rock formation the sand or proppant holds the fractures open so that the gas in the shale can flow to the wellbore and thus be produced the fluid or fracture fluids are mainly comprised of water and sand with a small balance consisting of additives that improve the efficiency of the fracture process the particulars of each hydraulic fracture are based on the specifics and characteristics of the rock formation in question given the importance of water to the fracturing process it is critical that shale gas developers identify sufficient sources of water before the process begins and plan for the peaceful coexistence with the needs of the community for the same water resources the volume of water used to stimulate a horizontal well to produce gas ranges from  million to  million gallons however these amounts are small in comparison to water used for agriculture electric power generation and in general represent a small percentage of overall water consumption for an area at the completion of the drilling and fracturing process the water used in the fracture stimulation process is produced back along with natural gas this water requires management to protect surface and ground water resources and ideally reduce future demands for fresh water stakeholders including local and federal governments and shale gas operators look for ways to “reduce reuse and recycle” in order to minimize the impact on the environment and the community water treatment technologies have been developed for use on shale gas produced water so that it can be reused imagesizer for joomla

throughout the entire process why are the district administrationscommunes not involved in the concession application process local authorities are involved in the concession granting process in the case of an exploration concession opinions of local mayors from communes covered by the intended concession area are required while in the case of the production concession consent of the local mayor’s from the area covered by the concession application is required the latter consent is to determine whether the intended production activity is compliant with the purpose or the manner of the use of the real property concerned as set forth in the local spatial development plan or – should there be no such plan – in the study of conditions and directions of spatial management and if it is compliant the consent should be granted also the issuance of either an exploration or a production concession typically needs to be preceded by obtaining an environmental decision this process involves local authorities in particular the local mayor and the regional director for environmental protection who issues the exploration permits in poland the minister of environment with the participation of local authorities how long does an exploration permit last an exploration permit lasts  years describe what is involved in obtaining an exploration concession a seismic permit a drilling permit and a production concession exploration concessions are issued by the minister of the environment following a complex administrative procedure which involves the participation of other authorities under the new geological and mining law january   the general principle is that exploration concessions shall be granted in the course of a tender process governed by nondiscriminatory rules and giving priority to the best exploration systems for example technological and technical solutions that are to be used by the applicants prior to issuing an exploration concession opinions from local mayors need to be otained by the minister of environment for seismic works there is no separate permit that would be required generally these works are conducted based on the concession permits as they constitute geological field works however to conduct seismic works the seismic contractor needs to obtain consents from landowners on whose land such works shall be performed for drilling the situation is similar to seismic works meaning that there is no separate permit required drilling is conducted also based on the concession permit with an additional decision of the mining authority approving the drilling operation plan required this decision is consulted with local authorities for a production concession the procedure is more complex and there are basically four major requirements that need to be fulfilled to be granted a production concession evidence of the existence of mineral deposits in the case of bnk and its project companies  shale gas deposits and approval of geological documentation of such prepare the deposit development plan determine the mining area the area where gas is to be produced as well as the mining impact area which is potentially a broader area than the mining area and covers land where potentially negative consequences of mining works can possibly be observed undergoing an environmental impact assessment for the production stage furthermore with regard to both types of concessions exploration and production it is worth stressing that they have to be accompanied by a mandatory mining usufruct agreement executed between the entity which was granted the concession and state treasury represented by the minister of environment based upon this agreement the state as the owner of mineral deposits entitles a concession holder to use the deposits in return for a mining usufruct fee general operations what will the shale development look like each shale development project is different at this stage of the exploration process it is difficult to predict exactly what the exploitation process will look like in europe bnk would utilize common drilling ‘pad’ sites to drill multiple wells from the same surface site we estimate that the distance between these ‘pad’ sites would be  to  kilometers apart bnk has and will continue to consider each step of the exploration and development processes with the same corporate philosophy of open and transparent dialogue minimum impact on the environment minimum surface footprint community acceptance see development for further information what is the difference between thermogenic gas and biogenic gas biogenic gas is natural gas produced by the decomposition of organic matter at shallow depths and at low temperatures such as compost while thermogenic natural gas conventional and unconventional is produced very deep in the earth at high temperatures and pressures it is very easy to distinguish them apart using specific measuring tools what is felt during seismic acquisition bnk utilizes vibroseis equipment to acquire its seismic data the only effect is some very minor and short groundvibrations when standing a few meters from the vehicles see more information on seismic what depth are exploration wells drilled to the depth depends entirely on the geology of each area and the shale formation shale formations in this area are expected to be at approximately  to  meters what are the steps to drill a well see drilling steps is the production of shale gas safe production of natural gas from shale rock formations is safe and is achieved using the same operating practices as conventional natural gas bnk adheres to local regional national and european regulations concerning its extraction in addition bnk follows industry best standards and practices and has the experience and knowledge to ensure safe operations and production see our environmental protection measures how much water is required during the drilling and hydraulic fracturing of an exploration unconventional natural gas well bnk expects to use approximately  m during the drilling phase and approximately  m per hydraulic stimulation stage for a vertical well we usually perform  hydraulic stimulation stage while a horizontal well may require between  and  stages a well is only hydraulically stimulated once in its life and existing technologies allows up to  of the water recovered to be recycled and used in other wells as a comparative example an olympic size pool has a volume of approximately  m  how much surface area is required for a wellsite during the exploration phase one wellsite is approximately between  m x  m see one of bnks wellsites during the development stage this area would accommodate  to  horizontal wells and thus minimizing the surface footprint how many wellsites are required for the development process it is difficult to fully answer this question until the exploration phase is completed and all data has been fully analyzed however in a viable shale development project bnk expects to drill approximately  horizontal wells per wellsite with each small wellsite approximately  km apart see information on multiple well drilling how long do drilling hydraulic stimulation and production operations last in unconventional projects the drilling process lasts between one and two months see an actual drilling rig while the preparation works for the hydraulic stimulation lasts only a few days each individual hydraulic stimulation usually lasts only a few hours and depends on the number of stages and shale rock characteristics the production process depends on the amount of natural gas present and can last between  years see an actual producing wellhead how is a wellsite selected the process to select and finalize a wellsite is very extensive and requires several months of preparation and study in summary the major phases are as follows first step extensive geological and seismic review of all available data leading to the identification of general areas to drill an exploration well gis geographic information system review to immediately exclude all sensitive zones and review access desktop review to identify water access archeological sites ecological sites etc initial visit to validate findings to date and prioritize wellsites second step  preliminary environmental review assessment per maximize distance from nearby residential areas protected areas areas of natural interest archeological zones etc review of agricultural areas to ensure minimum inconvenience review of access and transport routes to minimize disruptions review of topography to ensure minimal earthworks for the lease construction for more information visit wellsites does unconventional natural gas extraction use technical processes still in development natural gas extraction from shale rock formations involves several proven technologies which have been used safely for decades drilling for gas in shale rock formations is exactly the same process used in drilling for natural gas from other type of rock formations for well over one century hydraulic stimulation is a proven technology used for over  years as of  it is estimated that well over two million hydraulic fracture treatments have been performed the combination of both horizontal drilling and hydraulic stimulation has made it economically feasible to develop unconventional formations like deep layers of shale rock where we previously could not recover the oil and gas held within them see our techncial descriptions for further information does natural gas have an odor the natural gas produced is odorless the smell you may be familiar with when smelling natural gas is a chemical called mercaptan and is not related to the drilling or production process it is added by the natural gas distribution company to identify leaks in its distribution system does conducting seismic acquisition guarantee the drilling of an exploration well conducting seismic does not necessarily guarantee the drilling of an exploration well drilling an exploration well depends on results from geological studies and seismic interpretations overall wellsite selection process and acceptance from the community see more information on seismic are drilling operations and hydraulic stimulations conducted at night the drilling and hydraulic stimulation operations continue during the night but are reduced bnk endeavors to ensure that noise limits specified by law are observed during day and night operations hydraulic stimulation what would happen should the equipment fail during the hydraulic stimulation process in our experience we have never had a failure of the system the team conducting the hydraulic stimulation is highly experienced and has conducted similar operations on numerous occasions moreover in addition to everything being pressure tested prior to the hydraulic stimulation process we have several redundant safety precautions and safety mechanisms to prevent this from occurring this ensures the protection of people nature and infrastructure which is bnk’s key mandate what is hydraulic stimulation hydraulic stimulation or fracturingfracking is used as part of the process to complete a well and to stimulate production from rock formations by pumping a sandwater mixture at a controlled pressure high enough to crack the rock small fractures extend out from the well within the shale formation and creates pathways for the natural gas to flow into the well see more information on hydraulic stimulation what happens with the water used during the hydraulic stimulation the fracturing water flowback flows back out of the rock formation into the well and then into steel tanks at the surface this fluid is either recycledreused or treated and disposed of according to stringent regulations in place the small amount of water which is not immediately recovered returns slowly over time through the isolated wellbore or remains trapped thousands of meters below the surface in the shale formation via adsorption into clays what additives will you be using during the hydraulic stimulation process the final composition of the additives used is highly dependent on the rock characteristics of the shale formation which is unknown until wells are drilled the core recovered rock samples during the drilling process provides this information following detailed rock mineralogy analysis bnk’s mandate is to continue to utilize the most environmentally friendly additives available is the gas burning in the video showing the burning water tap caused by hydraulic stimulation no the gas which created the burning tap is from dissolved methane in water and was present years before any drilling occurred in the area this is biogenic gas which is naturally occurring and not thermogenic gas created from organic matter at high pressure and high temperatures and at great depths this gas has been present in the local groundwater for many years prior to gas well drilling and hydraulic fracture began  this phenomenon occurs in many areas throughout the world it is possible to identify each type of natural gas and this has been confirmed by the state of colorado oil and gas conservation commission in addition for further information and a better understanding watch this video  truthland is it possible to use environmentally friendly additives during the hydraulic stimulation process the three additives currently used by bnk are nontoxic andor inert bnk’s mandate is to continue to utilize the most environmentally friendly additives available is it possible for the fracturing water to enter the groundwater aquifers due to the high pressures involved during the hydraulic stimulation process in addition to proper well design the three casing strings and specialized cement in place to prevent any of the fracturing water from entering the groundwater aquifers we also have monitoring controls in place to confirm this isolation see casing installation steps how often is an unconventional well fractured typically each well is hydraulically fractured only once during its life how do you ensure the formation and fracturing waters do not communicate with the ground water aquifers there are several methods utilized during the well construction three steel casing and cement barriers click to view casing set up use of fresh water nontoxic drilling muds when drilling through the water aquifers sophisticated logs and pressure tests to ensure integrity of casing and cement continued pressure monitoring at the well during and after all operations continual monitoring of surrounding water wells prior to and after all operations soil testing at near and surrounding the wellsite during and after all operations in addition the wellsite is constructed in such a manner to ensure several redundant layers of protection are present against potential surface spills these steps have proven to be very effective see more information on wellsite construction and environmental protection can the fracturing water or natural gas migrate upwards through the rock because of the drilling or hydraulic stimulation the well design used by bnk prevents fracturing waternatural gas from migrating upwards to the groundwater aquifers this has been proven over decades of experience it is impossible for the small fractures created by the hydraulic fracture stimulation to reach the groundwater aquifers due to the lack of energy the multiple layers of rock and great distance between the shale formation and the groundwater aquifers are the chemical additives used in fracturing water carcinogenic or harmful to health the additives used by bnk are either nontoxic or inert even though chemical additives are carefully managed highly diluted and separated from all aquifers bnk’s mandate is to continue to utilize the most environmentally friendly additives available are the chemical additives used during the hydraulic stimulation process proprietary no the additives used by bnk are published on our website it is important to note that all the additives used by bnk during our recent hydraulic stimulations in poland are nontoxic see our table of additives for more information environmental who will assess the state of roads and buildings after your activity bnk works with each community where it has operations and conducts inspections before and after all its projects with local authorities when required what is an environmental impact assessment an environmental impact assessment eia is a technical study which evaluates in detail the potential impact of the exploration projects on animalsplant and the overall surrounding environment natura  parks habitats etc including below the surface in addition at a minimum the eia must also evaluate the potential impacts on surrounding structures historical landmarks archeological locations local inhabitants air and noise transport and waste disposal the eia is then submitted to relevant agencies within the local regional andor national governments for review discussion and approval what impacts do your activities have on the environment bnks experience adherence to best industry standards and regulations helps ensure minimal to no consequences to the environment in addition to confirm everything proceeds correctly bnk monitors air soil and water samples before we drill our first well and continualy during and afterwards the environmental impact assessment performed prior to drilling any well ensures that all wildlife and plant life amongst other things are properly preserved and protected see environmental protection for further information what happens with the waste during the drilling all waste such as the drilling mud and the rock cuttings are disposed of accordance to stringent regulations procedures and best industry practices see environmental protection for further information what does the wellsite look like following full reclamation once the well is abandoned according to regulations in place and best industry practices the wellsite is returned to its original state given some of the concessions have natura  sites parks habitats within their boudnaries how does bnk ensure their protection each area is thoroughly investigated during the pera and the environmental impact assessment to ensure bnk does not affect the environment where it works there are strict legal provisions which limit the possibility of conducting exploration activities in these areas and bnk always complies with such provisions does unconventional natural gas extraction produce high quantities of greenhouse gases production of unconventional natural gas is identical with the production of conventional natural gas and  lower than coal  in fact natural gas is the cleanest of all hydrocarbon fuels bnkpf stock price  bnk

indicated first quarter highlights in the first quarter of  the company drilled and fracture stimulated the chandler h well the first well in its  drilling program in which it holds a  working interest  the company also drilled the hartgraves h well and the brock h in each of which it holds a  working interest  the company expects to begin fracture stimulation on the hartgraves h well in the second quarter with the brock h well to be fracture stimulated after the hartgraves h well is completed average production for the first quarter of  was  boepd a decrease of  compared to first quarter  average production of  boepd due to three wells that were still shutin during the first quarter as a result of offset fracture stimulation operations on  wells by another operator in the woodford formation beneath the caney and also due to the normal production decline  the shutin wells decreased first quarter  production by over  boepd  production improved throughout the quarter with the addition of the chandler h well and march  production was over  boe per day even without the three wells returning to full production in the quarter the company continued to reduce its costs  ga expenses decreased by another  in the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  due to continuing cost cutting efforts funds from continuing operations was approximately  million in the first quarter  compared to  million in the first quarter of   the decrease in funds from continuing operations was mainly due to the shutin wells as well as lower realized gains from commodity contracts in the first quarter of  compared to  partially offset by the pricing increase net income for the first quarter of  was approximately  million compared to a net loss of  million for the first quarter of  due to the unrealized gain of  million from hedged commodity contracts in the first quarter of  revenue net of royalties was  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million for first quarter of  an increase of  as average prices increased by  between the quarters which offset the production decrease average netback per barrel for the first quarter of  was  an increase of  from the prior year first quarter due to the higher prices in   over  of first quarter  oil production was hedged which resulted in substantially higher netbacks when the impact of commodity hedges are included  if the commodity contract hedges are included in the computation the average netback per barrel increases  to  in  compared to  in the first quarter of  cash totaled  million and working capital totaled  million at march   bnks president and chief executive officer wolf regener commented during the first quarter we used the proceeds from our  equity offering to begin our  drilling program we drilled and completed the chandler h well  working interest and drilled the hartgraves h well  working interest and the brock h well  working interest  we expect to perform the fracture stimulation of the hartgraves h well in the second quarter with the brock h well to follow  we are looking forward to the completion of these wells which we believe will outperform all of our previous wells due to both wells having full length laterals available for stimulation improved placement of the laterals in the caney based on previous learnings and both being located in areas where we have excellent calculated original oil in place numbers our net revenue increased by  in the first quarter  as average prices increased by  compared to the prior year quarter  the price increase offset the impact of our decline in production due to the three shutin wells during the first quarter which reduced production by over  boepd during the quarter  however our production increased throughout the quarter as the chandler h well started production in late february and the shutin wells were brought back online  our march  production was over  boepd  all the shutin wells are still pumping off the offset operators frack water and at the end of the quarter were still about  boepd below expected production levels  we dont expect any impact to the longterm production of the wells even though they are recovering slower than we originally expected them too the company continues to succeed in its costcutting efforts  in the first quarter of  a reduction of general and administrative expense of  was achieved over the first quarter of   these continued cost savings coupled with a  increase in average prices compared to the prior year quarter contributed to the company generating funds from operations of  million despite the loss of production from the shutin wells the companys hedging position has continued to allow us to realize higher prices than current market levels for a portion of our production  during the first quarter  the company was able to realize an average price of bbl on more than  of its oil production  we expect a comparable level of hedging in the rest of  as the company has commodity contracts in place to recognize an average price of bbl on  of existing  production going forward excluding the new production coming online from the  drilling program average netbacks for the first quarter of  were  an increase of  compared to the prior year due to higher prices  if we include the impact of the realized gains from the commodity contracts our average
