marston  item vavailability usually ships the same business day product descriptionv arthur endreze the complete arthur endrčze inclunpublished broadcast performances plus an interview marston  specially priced cds for the price of    critic reviewsthis noble voice effortlessly produced with a fine forward sound is a tribute to his background and surely reflects assiduous study and discipline the seamless legato is an object lesson and aids the refined phrasing endrčze repeatedly demonstrates he never makes a harsh sound and while the lower register is comparatively weak the top is secure with for some the hint of a tenor sound his long phrases show remarkable breath controlhe later came under the wing of the consummate musician singer and composer reynaldo hahn and emerged encrusted with honoursthe transfers are as is usual with marston very good indeed and the voice reproduces well on a variety of sound systemsof great importance are his arias from magnards guercoeur it boasts long phrases sung with amazing controlthe hahn songs as you would expect are beautifully sung with an enviable legato and honour his mentori must make reference to his recordings of the wagner excepts how i wish we had a dutchman of his calibre today endrčze demonstrates that wagner can be sung lyrically and yet have all the drama the music requires wotans farewell is also nobly moving and you can understand why endrčze was such a valuable member of the paris opera scene from the mid twenties until the war interrupted his careerthis meticulously presented marston set has all the characteristics of his previous issues good transfers and cds five this time neatly packed with a most informative booklet in a compact box easy to use this set deserves a place in every vocal music collectors library khushroo suntook the record collector arthur endrčze was born arthur endres kraeckmann in chicago where the conductor walter damrosch discovered his beautiful voice and recommended him to study singing it was not until  when he came to france by way of the american academy at fontainebleau while there he took instruction from jean de reszké and began a career as a recitalist he made his opera début in  as don giovanni at the nice opera house it was the composer and baritone reynaldo hahn who invited endrčze to appear in some opera performances at cannes and deauville he débuted as karnack in lalos le roi dys at the opéracomique in  followed by the first appearance at the grand opéra as valentin where he created a variety of roles of french contemporary operas the most successful creation was the title role in magnards guercoeur in  he took part in the first performance of honeggeriberts laiglon endrčze was the leading baritone at the grand opéra for almost  years where he enjoyed a remarkable success in the titlerole of méhuls joseph during his entire career he was also a frequent guest at the operas of nice brussels and monte carlo he never appeared in the united statesthe greatest french tenor of the latter part of the th century jean de reszké in fact the greatest french singer of his day was arthur endrčzes teacher for three years de reszké began as a baritone and restudied as a tenor arthur endrčze and jean de reszké were not french by birth but we should remember that vocal style is the product of cultural identification not the accident of birth  a baby born in a stable is not a horse as michael scott explained endrčze found his artistic temperament destined for the serious and tragic incarnations he never appeared in mozart and rossini except don giovannithere is neither roundness nor brilliance in his voice as we know from italian baritones but his is a warm and highly individual instrument of a velvety quality in the upper register particularly in the lyrical parts you can hear his perfect mezza voce and his great ability to sing with inner emotion he articulates each phrase with a feeling for the particular color that helps to illuminate its meaning endrčze had a perfect french pronunciation all the more remarkable for a native american and when listening to him you will know what french diction is about his hérode hamlet and athanaël  not to forget his song recordings  are wonderful examples of french singing art arthur endrčze is a favorite baritone of mine because of his entirely personal and sensual approach to music andrea shumbinder subitocantabileon records endrčze projects a romanticism that supports his image his voice is velvety and sensual he articulates each phrase with a feeling for the particular color that helps illuminate its meaning as a singing actor arthur endrčze was the heir to jean de reszkés legendary magic he also deserves recognition as one of the greatest american baritones harold brudera pupil of jean de reszké a young american baritone mr endrčze did unusually good work in the difficult rôle of guercoeur he has the best voice which has been heard for some years on the opéra boards his voice has in reality the characteristic timbre of a tenor and he is able to reach both the upper and lower extremes with ease the power of his voice is unusual he is moreover an artist who is full of intelligence and one who has proved himself to be an excellent actor his success was great henry pruničres the new york timesas for the twelve songs endrčze recorded with piano they give one the opportunity to hear him for once in languages other than frenchand dare one say that he impresses more in german than in his native tongue the gems are nevertheless the two faurés the delightful paladilhe and the three hahns with the considerable bonus of having the composer as accompanist among the songs he recorded for the french radio in the late s or early s particularly interesting on account of their relative rarity are the chaussons nanny and hébé and the even rarer paysages tristes the cycle on verlaine poems composed in  by charles bordes a disciple of césar franck chiefly remembered for being along with vincent dindy one of the founders of the schola cantorum in  vincent giroud program notes norpetecom webutation business
