in venice and many offices throughout the worldwe did however make a change to the way we operate our business in london going forward we will bill our advertising revenue from the uk and a few other countries through a uk entity this allows us to pay taxes in the uk which we believe is part of being a good local partner as we grow our businesswe want to pay taxes in the countries where we sell advertising and this is an important step in building the infrastructure to achieve that goal team snapdechappy holidaysthe holidays are a great time to hang out with friends and spend time with family – it’s always better together we couldn’t think of a better time to announce groups a new way to communicate with up to  friends on snapchat groups can be created while sending a snap or when

consisting solely of electrical engineer jon rodriguez software engineer peter brook and mechanical engineer david meisenholder the company had to scale back its ambitions in order to ship a much simpler first product epiphany eyewear which they could manage to deliver despite the extremely limited size of their team  the successful development and launch of this minimumviable product led to the company being noticed by snapchat which quietly acquired them bringing them inhouse to develop a similar but much more powerful and refined eyewear product for snapchat on october  a video leaked
