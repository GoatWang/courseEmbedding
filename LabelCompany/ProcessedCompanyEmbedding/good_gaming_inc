now very precise and a grreat mouse so keyboardlogitechmice razerjust my cents mercerapr    am they are supposed to be but i think that they are a little over priced for the features you get and imo i don’t like the look of most of their gear related resources which keyboard would you suggest best fps keyboard after using the logitech g which keyboard razer abyssus vs logitech g keyboard mod idea  good or not cant find your answer  ask  get the answer boilerapr    am im personally never going to buy another razer product again since ive found higher quality parts among other brandsi owned two razer mice naga  deathadder and the drivers on my pc killed both mice within  mins good thing both mice werent in the warranty period sswitched to a cyborg rat  and cant use another mouse you get such an extremely customized feel that it seems like the mouse was built to fit your hand from the start the rat  is personally what i would spend my money on now since you get an adjustable thumb and pinky rest in addition to the adjustable palm and weights in the rat  aside from that the really key difference for me was that the rats are machined from aluminum and the razers are made of plastic yet you pay about the same for each im betting it costs razer  to make an  mouseas for keyboards id go logitech or some other brand mechanical keyboards are worth looking into if youre looking for a good board again i would avoid the razer blackwidow  heard of issues with the keys and the firmware from time to time mercerapr    am i have the rat  to and i love it also you can turn the rat  into the rat  by unscrewing a few screws and buying the spare parts zombieapr    am the cyborgs design is just way to crazy for me even though ive heard nothing but good things about themi have to admit that the lycossa interests me a good bit just for the aesthetics the ability to program any key to be macro compatible and the slim keys but ive heard so many horror stories about it that i doubt i could bring myself to buy itim looking into the logitech g keyboard right now and the razer imperator it seems like a solid choice but what do you mean your drivers killed your mouse  mercerapr    am what kind of games will you be playing because there are mice designed for fps or rpgs ttgavengedapr    am mercer said i have the rat  to and i love it also you can turn the rat  into the rat  by unscrewing a few screws and buying the spare parts i have a rat  too omg really wow i gotta do that mercerapr    am the is a screw on the palm rest rail the very small black ones then when undone you can slide the rest back and forth or completely of i have literally just done it although i figured that it was possible ages ago amuffinapr    am how does the corsair m stack up against those candianoaktreejul    am razer is a very good brand for the price though i would suggest other brands but some of the products are better and cheaper than other brands razer kraken vs turtle beach but if you can afford it and you are debating weather an expensive logitech product or a razer id rather get the razer bojan lukicoct    am zombie said i really like the design of razers mice but their
