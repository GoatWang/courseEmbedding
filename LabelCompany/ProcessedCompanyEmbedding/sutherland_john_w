halvorsen timothy l jenkins christopher polonowski john w sutherland michigan technological university has established a broadbased universitywide research initiative termed woodtowheels ww to develop

industries  technical paper  walter w olson john w sutherland the national science foundation recently sponsored a workshop on environmentally benign manufacturing ebm for the transportation industries the objective of the workshop was to determine future directions of research in the ebm area and to construct a roadmap for development of future research programs while research in the fields of design for the environment dfe and life cycle analysis lca have focused on the product and product life cycles an additional focus is needed to find and develop processes with less environmental impact within the manufacturing environment this workshop explored ebm issues with respect to the enterprise the products the processes and the materials a proposed lca model of environmental effects with markovian decision making  technical paper  dusan milacic hrishikesh gowaikar walter w olson john w sutherland as the pool of existing nonrenewable natural resources continues to shrink it will be necessary for government and industrial leaders to achieve a workable strategy for the intelligent allocation of scarce resources in this paper a method of quantifying the environmental and resource impacts of product redesign is proposed this new method utilizes input output analysis coupled with the markovian decision making into a single matrixbased tool the benefit of a fully developed tool would be the ability to make informed preproduction decisions leading to optimum product and process designs with minimal environmental impact this paper illustrates this technique with an example based upon real industry data and extrapolated effects research advances in dry and semidry machining  technical paper  cecil m daniel walter w olson john w sutherland the current trend in the automotive industry is to minimizeeliminate cutting fluid use in most machining operations research is required prior to achieving dry or semidry machining issues such as heat generation and transfer thermal deformation and fluid lubricity related effects on tool life and surface roughness determine the feasibility of dry machining this paper discusses recent advances in achieving drysemidry machining as the first step research has been conducted to investigate the actual role of fluids if any in various machining operations a predictive heat generation model for orthogonal cutting of viscoplastic material was created a control volume approach allowed development of a thermal model for convective heat transfer during machining the heat transfer performance of an air jet in dry machining was explored the influence of machining process variables and cutting fluid presence on chip morphology was investigated through designed experiments modeling the thread chasing process for improved product quality  technical paper  john w sutherland william j zdeblick a simulation model for the thread chasing process an operation widely used to produce pipe threads is described this model focuses on the prediction of the cutting force system and is based on submodels for the process geometry toolwork contact area chip load chip loadforce relationship and the structural response of the machining system when acted on by the cutting forces the model is shown to be capable of predicting the cutting torque cutting forces and displacement present in the process experimental data obtained from a turning process is used to condition the model to the material of interest the process model is then verified through physical experiments conducted with the thread chasing process discussion is presented on how the model may best be put to use for enhancing the quality of the thread chasing process and its associated products nextbackviewing  to  of  filter
