classical tragedy orson welles othello is a tale of passion jealousy and murder welles used his earnings from several performances including carol reeds classic the third man to finance the production which was shot over several years across multiple locations including italy and morocco the footage was well matched photographically resulting in an artistically brave compression of a great play in the title role welles shows us a man who has fought many wars but still maintains a princely disposition as desdemona suzanne cloutier is guileless but strong enough to have wanted and pursued the moor she alone is accused of pretending to be what she is not and her openness makes her suspect in a world where few appear to be as they are in a rare filmed role micheã¡l macliammã³r excels as the diabolical iago a master of manipulating appearances and devoid of any motive save pure evil macliammã³r shows how a hint can be greater than a howl executing a series of deceptions whose victims include roderigo brabantio and cassio that culminate in the symbolic destruction of desdemona the financial constraints appear to have ignited an even higher level of creativity within welles who never takes the expected angle and directs the film with a vertiginous exhibitionist energy though roderigos death scene was filmed in a moroccan steam bath because the costumes had not arrived it is refreshing to see a shakespeare film in which the cast doesnt look like its on its way to a beverly hills costume party with an elizabethan theme the allegorical journey between heaven and hell concludes with the exposure of both iagos scheme and the tragedy of othello who ultimately could not believe in the purity of his wife this othello won the prestigious product details actors orson

next to the castle wall throughout there is eerie music and unintelligible chantingthe scene concludes with a title card and a brief spoken introduction then we’re taken to venice and the story begins

 starsstill dont know mr arkadinbycharles from redondo beachon may  format dvdverified purchasefull and fair disclosure i am an orson wells fan and recently purchased five of his films i purchased the criterion collection box set as a wells fan i thought this was the best option because it came with both versions of the film plus an unexpected bonus feature of the novel by wells i should have read the product description better i wasnt disappointed with my purchase it exceeded my high expectationsafter watching both versions of the film i ended up liking the longer one better of the twothe criterion collection version would make an excellent gift for someone who truly enjoys classic american cinemaread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starshe complete mr arkadin the criterion collectionbyvmguyon march  format dvdverified purchasearkadin gets the usual lavish criterion treatment with lots of extras including a paperback novelization three episodes of an orson welles radio show are also included and they show how parts of arkadins script were lifted wordforword from the shows as for the movie itself i was

purchasefirst i would like to express my appreciation for the review by felix felicis apr   which i thought was extremely helpful and interesting and wise the reason i am adding my own review is to emphasize the wondrous acting interludes in this movie mr welles of course is always hypnotic i can never take my eyes off him in any movie in which he appears or waddles the two american leads robert arden and patricia medina are of course hilariously bad as has been mentioned ad infinitum ad nauseam imagine robert mitchum and marilyn monroe or jayne mansfield or maybe brigitte bardot and as raina think of natalie wood oh well never mind them the four reasons mr arkadin is marvelous are akim tamiroff in his sad pathetic enormously brave and heartbreaking portrayal of the indignities of old age and poverty at one point he pleads to be allowed to put on his trousers to cover up his soiled underwear i have a feeling that was an improvised line mischa auer and the flea circus it is not just the human actor but the insect performers who made my jaw drop as i stared obsessively at the screen in this unbelievable gothic and unforgettable cameo michael redgrave i have seen michael redgrave in many british films of the s but i did not recognize him as the weird hitchcockian antiques dealer that was michael redgrave i thought reading the credits i can watch this scene over and over again and never get tired of it last  the most incredible and most marvelous katina paxinou if the movie contained nothing else but katina paxinou as sophia it would rate five stars six stars maybe ten starsof course there are other things in mr arkadin the penitentes the masquerade ball the german street reminiscent of the third mans vienna the tale of the scorpion and the frog which one is arkadin maybe hes both maybe hes aristotle onassis who cares watch the movieread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsconfidentially docbyannie van aukentop  reviewervine voiceon may  format dvdverified purchasemr arkadin aka confidential report is now advertised as a forgotten orson welles classic in all probability this movie in first run was rightly dismissed as a mediocrity the script is by turn confused and transparently predictable welles as the main character mugs for a tilted camera to the point of annoyance and his direction is heavy handed the overuse of skewed horizons bizarre camera angles cluttered sets and jarring edits do nothing but distract the viewer peripheral eccentrics pass through the story as rapidly as the blurry panning used in one sceneplot spoilers followthe wealthy mr a estimated worth  million dollars feigns amnesia and sends a wouldbe blackmailer guy van stratten on a worldwide search for answers to his mysterious past the true motive is to prevent his daughter raina from learning that her father was once a lowlife gangster arkadin secretly tails his hired investigator and disposes of old acquaintances as each is discovered note that none of these killings is ever shown once the last link to his past is destroyed arkadin intends to either frame van stratten for the several murders or kill him realizing this the frightened man flees to spain and the arms of waiting raina where he believes he will be safe arkadin follows by piloting his small plane in a race to beat van stratten to raina in a desperate radio conversation with his daughter arkadin is misled into believing she knows everything so he apparently throws himself from the airplane again this is impliedmr arkadin is not of the caliber nor does it resemble in any way citizen kane or the third man and is in fact one of this great director and actors weakest efforts for welles completists onlymr w receives star billing for his portrayal of a defense attorney in the last part of compulsion a murder story based on the leopold and loeb caseread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsfor orson enthusiasts only movie   add an extra for the bonus materialbymatthew farrellon november  format dvdverified purchasei picked this up in my ongoing quest to get all things orson welles ive now watched it once and doubt ill see it again any time soon then again maybe itll grow on meits no secret this movie has a very checkered history and welles himself was highly disappointed with it there are  different edits of this all included in the collection so armchair scholars can doubtless spend time comparing and contrasting them but to be honest the movie itself is not interesting enough to merit it the story is soso and one of the weakest aspects was orson himself he looks terrible in this with the ridiculous beard and wig and what i can only hope was an attempt at a hungarian accenton the plus side the film has a few diamonds in its rough orson moments where his brilliance as a director shine through notable are a stunning shadowlit flashback early on and a fun little pov scene simulating a drunk person on a boat during a storm enough to hold my interest but not really enough to save this likewise theres a lot of nifty bonus material though it doesnt have high replay valuelike i said this may well grow on me in the future but between now and whenever i expect it to get a lot of dust on the shelfread morecomment  people

diego california  darren j quinn law offices of darren j quinn san diego california for the defendantsappellees playboy enterprises inc pei appeals the district courts grant of summary judgment as to its claims of trademark infringement unfair competition and breach of contract against terri welles  terri welles inc   pippi inc   and welles current and former “webmasters” steven huntington and michael mihalko   we have jurisdiction pursuant to  usc §  and we affirm in part and reverse in partin a separate memorandum disposition we resolve welles crossappeal of the district courts grant of summary judgment as to her counterclaims for defamation intentional infliction of emotional distress unfair competition and interference with prospective economic advantage   welles huntington and mihalko also appeal the district courts denial of their requests for attorneys fees   we resolve that issue in the memorandum disposition as wellibackgroundterri welles was on the cover of playboy in  and was chosen to be the playboy playmate of the year for    her use of the title “playboy playmate of the year ” and her use of other trademarked terms on her website are at issue in this suit   during the relevant time period welles website offered information about and free photos of welles advertised photos for sale advertised memberships in her photo club and promoted her services as a spokesperson   a biographical section described welles selection as playmate of the year in  and her years modeling for pei after the lawsuit began welles included discussions of the suit and criticism of pei on her website and included a note disclaiming any association with pei pei complains of four different uses of its trademarked terms on welles website   the terms “playboy” and “playmate” in the metatags of the website    the phrase “playmate of the year ” on the masthead of the website   the phrases “playboy playmate of the year ” and “playmate of the year ” on various banner ads which may be transferred to other websites  and  the repeated use of the abbreviation “pmoy ′” as the watermark on the pages of the website  pei claimed that these uses of its marks constituted trademark infringement dilution false designation of origin and unfair competition   the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment   pei appeals the grant of summary judgment on its infringement and dilution claims   we affirm in part and reverse in partthe district court also granted summary judgment on peis contract claims   those claims arose from a contract between pei and a corporation created by welles “pippi inc” when welles agreed to be playmate of the year in  pippi inc signed a contract with pei the contract contained a term requiring prior written approval from pei before welles made any “nonplayboy use of her name with the designation ‘playmate of the year’ ” pippi inc was dissolved in    pei argues that pippi inc was welles alter ego and that the terms of the contract are currently enforceable against welles   the district court rejected this argument and granted summary judgment on peis contract claims in favor of welles   we affirmiistandard of review we review the district courts grant of summary judgment de novo  viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law  the court must not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter but only determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial iiidiscussiona trademark infringementexcept for the use of peis protected terms in the wallpaper of welles website we conclude that welles uses of peis trademarks are permissible nominative uses   they imply no current sponsorship or endorsement by pei instead they serve to identify welles as a past pei “playmate of the year”   we articulated the test for a permissible nominative use in new kids on the block v new america publishing inc the band new kids on the block claimed trademark infringement arising from the use of their trademarked name by several newspapers   the newspapers had conducted polls asking which member of the band new kids on the block was the best and most popular  the papers use of the trademarked term did not fall within the traditional fair use doctrine   unlike a traditional fair use scenario the defendant newspaper was using the trademarked term to describe not its own product but the plaintiffs  thus the factors used to evaluate fair use were inapplicable  the use was nonetheless permissible we concluded based on its nominative nature we adopted the following test for nominative usefirst the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark  second only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service  and third the user must do nothing that would in conjunction with the mark suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holderwe noted in new kids that a nominative use may also be a commercial one  in cases in which the defendant raises a nominative use defense the above threefactor test should be applied instead of the test for likelihood of confusion set forth in sleekcraft  the threefactor test better evaluates the likelihood of confusion in nominative use cases   when a defendant uses a trademark nominally the trademark will be identical to the plaintiffs mark at least in terms of the words in question   thus application of the sleekcraft test which focuses on the similarity of the mark used by the plaintiff and the defendant would lead to the incorrect conclusion that virtually all nominative uses are confusing   the threefactor testwith its requirements that the defendant use marks only when no descriptive substitute exists use no more of the mark than necessary and do nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the mark holderbetter addresses concerns regarding the likelihood of confusion in nominative use caseswe group the uses of peis trademarked terms into three for the purpose of applying the test for nominative use   first we analyze welles use of the terms in headlines and banner advertisements   we conclude that those uses are clearly nominative   second we analyze the use of the terms in the metatags for welles website which we conclude are nominative as well   finally we analyze the terms as used in the wallpaper of the website   we conclude that this use is not nominative and remand for a determination of whether it infringes on a pei trademark headlines and banner advertisements to satisfy the first part of the test for nominative use “the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark”   this situation arises “when a trademark also describes a person a place or an attribute of a product”  and there is no descriptive substitute for the trademark   in such a circumstance allowing the trademark holder exclusive rights would allow the language to “be depleted in much the same way as if generic words were protectable”   in new kids we gave the example of the trademarked term “chicago bulls”   we explained that “one might refer to the ‘twotime world champions or ‘the professional basketball team from chicago’ but its far simpler and more likely to be understood to refer to the chicago bulls”   moreover such a use of the trademark would “not imply sponsorship or endorsement of the product because the mark is used only to describe the thing rather than to identify its source”   thus we concluded such uses must be excepted from trademark infringement lawthe district court properly identified welles situation as one which must also be excepted   no descriptive substitute exists for peis trademarks in this context   the court explainedthere is no other way that ms welles can identify or describe herself and her services without venturing into absurd descriptive phrases   to describe herself as the “nude model selected by mr hefners magazine as its numberone prototypical woman for the year ” would be impractical as well as ineffectual in identifying terri welles to the publicwe agree   just as the newspapers in new kids could only identify the band clearly by using its trademarked name so can welles only identify herself clearly by using peis trademarked title the second part of the nominative use test requires that “only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service”   new kids provided the following examples to explain this element  “a soft drink competitor would be entitled to compare its product to cocacola or coke but would not be entitled to use cocacolas distinctive lettering”   similarly in a past case an auto shop was allowed to use the trademarked term “volkswagen” on a sign describing the cars it repaired in part because the shop “did not use volkswagens distinctive lettering style or color scheme nor did he display the encircled ‘vw’ emblem”   welles banner advertisements and headlines satisfy this element because they use only the trademarked words not the font or symbols associated with the trademarksthe third element requires that the user do “nothing that would in conjunction with the mark suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder”   as to this element we conclude that aside from the wallpaper which we address separately welles does nothing in conjunction with her use of the marks to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by pei the marks are clearly used to describe the title she received from pei in  a title that helps describe who she is   it would be unreasonable to assume that the chicago bulls sponsored a website of michael jordans simply because his name appeared with the appellation “former chicago bull” similarly in this case it would be unreasonable to assume that pei currently sponsors or endorses someone who describes herself as a “playboy playmate of the year in ”   the designation of the year in our case serves the same function as the “former” in our example   it shows that any sponsorship or endorsement occurred in the past in addition to doing nothing in conjunction with her use of the marks to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by pei welles affirmatively disavows any sponsorship or endorsement   her site contains a clear statement disclaiming any connection to pei moreover the text of the site describes her ongoing legal battles with the company for the foregoing reasons we conclude that welles use of peis marks in her headlines and banner advertisements is a nominative use excepted from the law of trademark infringement metatags welles includes the terms “playboy” and “playmate” in her metatags   metatags describe the contents of a website using keywords some search engines search metatags to identify websites relevant to a search  thus when an internet searcher enters “playboy” or “playmate” into a search engine that uses metatags the results will include welles site  because welles metatags do not repeat the terms extensively her site will not be at the top of the list of search results   applying the threefactor test for nominative use we conclude that the use of the trademarked terms in welles metatags is nominativeas we discussed above with regard to the headlines and banner advertisements welles has no practical way of describing herself without using trademarked terms   in the context of metatags we conclude that she has no practical way of identifying the content of her website without referring to peis trademarksa large portion of welles website discusses her association with playboy over the years   thus the trademarked terms accurately describe the contents of welles website in addition to describing welles   forcing welles and others to use absurd turns of phrase in their metatags such as those necessary to identify welles would be particularly damaging in the internet search context   searchers would have a much more difficult time locating relevant websites if they could do so only by correctly guessing the long phrases necessary to substitute for trademarks   we can hardly expect someone searching for welles site to imagine the same phrase proposed by the district court to describe welles without referring to playboy“the nude model selected by mr hefners organization․” yet if someone could not remember her name that is what they would have to do   similarly someone searching for critiques of playboy on the internet would have a difficult time if internet sites could not list the object of their critique in their metatagsthere is simply no descriptive substitute for the trademarks used in welles metatags   precluding their use would have the unwanted effect of hindering the free flow of information on the internet something which is certainly not a goal of trademark law  accordingly the use of trademarked terms in the metatags meets the first part of the test for nominative usewe conclude that the metatags satisfy the second and third elements of the test as well   the metatags use only so much of the marks as reasonably necessary  and nothing is done in conjunction with them to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder   we note that our decision might differ if the metatags listed the trademarked term so repeatedly that welles site would regularly appear above peis in searches for one of the trademarked terms  wallpaperwatermark the background or wallpaper of welles site consists of the repeated abbreviation “pmoy ′” which stands for “playmate of the year ”   welles name or likeness does not appear before or after “pmoy ′ ” the pattern created by the repeated abbreviation appears as the background of the various pages of the website   accepting for the purposes of this appeal that the abbreviation “pmoy” is indeed entitled to protection we conclude that the repeated stylized use of this abbreviation fails the nominative use testthe repeated depiction of “pmoy ′” is not necessary to describe welles   “playboy playmate of the year ” is quite adequate   moreover the term does not even appear to describe wellesher name or likeness do not appear before or after each “pmoy ′” because the use of the abbreviation fails the first prong of the nominative use test we need not apply the next two prongs of the testbecause the defense of nominative use fails here and we have already determined that the doctrine of fair use does not apply we remand to the district court   the court must determine whether trademark law protects the abbreviation “pmoy” as used in the wallpaperb trademark dilution the district court granted summary judgment to welles as to peis claim of trademark dilution   we affirm on the ground that all of welles uses of peis marks with the exception of the use in the wallpaper which we address separately are proper nominative uses   we hold that nominative uses by definition do not dilute the trademarks federal law provides protection against trademark dilutionthe owner of a famous mark shall be entitled subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable to an injunction against another persons commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark․ dilution which was not defined by the statute has been described by the courts as “the gradual ‘whittling away’ of a trademarks value”   traditionally courts have recognized two forms of dilution  blurring and tarnishment   blurring occurs when anothers use of a mark creates “the possibility that the mark will lose its ability to serve as a unique identifier of the plaintiffs product”   tarnishment on the other hand occurs “when a famous mark is improperly associated with an inferior or offensive product or service”   as we recognized in panavision dilution may occur through uses on the internet as well as elsewhere  dilution works its harm not by causing confusion in consumers minds regarding the source of a good or service but by creating an association in consumers minds between a mark and a different good or service  as explained in a first circuit case in dilution as compared to infringement “an entirely different issue is at stakenot interference with the source signaling function but rather protection from an appropriation of or free riding on the investment the trademark holder has made in its trademark”   thus for example if a cocoa maker began using the “rolls royce” mark to identify its hot chocolate no consumer confusion would be likely to result   few would assume that the car company had expanded into the cocoa making business   however the cocoa maker would be capitalizing on the investment the car company had made in its mark   consumers readily associate the mark with highly priced automobiles of a certain quality   by identifying the cocoa with the rolls royce mark the producer would be capitalizing on consumers association of the mark with high quality items   moreover by labeling a different product “rolls royce” the cocoa company would be reducing the ability of the mark to identify the mark holders product   if someone said “im going to get a rolls royce” others could no longer be sure the person was planning on buying an expensive automobile   the person might just be planning on buying a cup of cocoa   thus the use of the mark to identify the hot chocolate although not causing consumer confusion would cause harm by diluting the mark uses that do not create an improper association between a mark and a new product but merely identify the trademark holders products should be excepted from the reach of the antidilution statute   such uses cause no harm   the antidilution statute recognizes this principle and specifically excepts users of a trademark who compare their product in “commercial advertising or promotion to identify the competing goods or services of the owner of the famous mark”   for the same reason uses in comparative advertising are excepted from antidilution law we conclude that nominative uses are also excepted   a nominative use by definition refers to the trademark holders product   it does not create an improper association in consumers minds between a new product and the trademark holders markwhen welles refers to her title she is in effect referring to a product of peis she does not dilute the title by truthfully identifying herself as its onetime recipient any more than michael jordan would dilute the name “chicago bulls” by referring to himself as a former member of that team or the twotime winner of an academy award would dilute the award by referring to him or herself as a “twotime academy award winner”   awards are not diminished or diluted by the fact that they have been awarded in the past   similarly they are not diminished or diluted when past recipients truthfully identify themselves as such   it is in the nature of honors and awards to be identified with the people who receive them   of course the conferrer of such honors and awards is free to limit the honorees use of the title or references to the award by contract   so long as a use is nominative however trademark law is unavailing the one exception to the above analysis in this case is welles use of the abbreviation “pmoy” on her wallpaper   because we determined that this use is not nominative it is not excepted from the antidilution provisions   thus we reverse as to this issue and remand for further proceedings   we note that if the district court determines that “pmoy” is not entitled to trademark protection peis claim for dilution must fail   the trademarked term “playmate of the year” is not identical or nearly identical to the term “pmoy” therefore use of the term “pmoy” cannot as a matter of law dilute the trademark “playmate of the year”  c contract the district court granted summary judgment against pei on its contract claims   we affirm   although we conclude that pei advanced sufficient evidence to establish unity of interest the first prong of the alter ego test we agree with the district court that pei advanced insufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment on the second prong   pei did not show that “the facts are such that an adherence to the fiction of the separate existence of the corporation would under the particular circumstances sanction a fraud or promote injustice”   we note that the alter ego rule is generally applied with caution  the district court did not err by declining to apply it hereivconclusionfor the foregoing reasons we affirm the district courts grant of summary judgment as to peis claims for trademark infringement and trademark dilution with the sole exception of the use of the abbreviation “pmoy” we reverse as to the abbreviation and remand for consideration of whether it merits protection under either an infringement or a dilution theory   we also affirm as to peis claims for breach of contract   in a separate memorandum disposition we resolve the issues raised by welles crossappealaffirmed in part reversed and remanded in part   costs to terri welles and terri welles incfootnotes   the disclaimer reads as follows  “this site is neither endorsed nor sponsored

defendant was featured on the cover of a  playboy magazine defendant was a playboy model and playmate of the year who used these trademarked terms to describe herself via her personal website plaintiff’s sued defendant for defendant’s under two theories trademark infringement and trademark dilution opinion of the courtedit the court held that nominative use a type of fair use for discussing the product itself is permitted where the product or service can not be readily identified without using the trademark ie trademark is descriptive of a person place or product attribute only so much of the mark may be used as is reasonably necessary for identification eg the words may be reasonably used but not the specific font or logo and the user does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder  which applies even if the nominative use is commercial here the ninth circuit court applied the nominative fair use test to the defendant and concluded the defendant’s use of these trademarked items was permissible because there was no other practical way for the defendant to describe herself the plaintiff was relying on the decision in brookfield communications inc v west coast entertainment corp to support the contention that the defendant’s use of playboy trademark in her web site infringes on its trademark by causing likelihood of confusion shown on the basis of initial interest confusion however the court added that the plaintiff’s reliance on brookfield was misplaced none of the cases which brookfield discusses involved fair use defense or a use of trademarks in the metatags which accurately and fairly described the contents of the web page or web site the court defined plaintiff’s use of the theory of ‘initial interest of confusion’ as “confusion of ‘consumer attention even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion” in order for this type confusion to be actionable under the lanham act several factors must be reviewed evidence of the initial interest confusion as being “damaging and wrongful” evidence that confusion between two products “will mistakenly lead the consumer to believe there is some connection between the two and therefore develop an interest in the defendant’s line that it would otherwise not have” or evidence that the “situation offers an opportunity for sale not otherwise available by enabling defendant to interest prospective customers by confusion with the plaintiff’s product” in this case the plaintiff failed to present any of the facts indicating any initial interest confusion was “damaging and wrongful” anyone believes or is likely to believe there is a connection welles’ site and playboy’s welles received “opportunities for sale not otherwise available” by confusing web users or any of welles’ actual customers were in the “appreciable number” or majority of people who when plugging in one of the plaintiff’s trademark terms into a web browser search engine was “looking for playboy’s official site” there was also no evidence welles intended to divert plaintiff’s customers to her web site by trading on playboy’s goodwill this intent was relevant since the court in brookfield stated that in “dr seuss the ninth circuit explicitly recognized that the use of another’s trademark in a manner calculated to capture initial consumer attention even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion may be still an infringement” brookfield at  conclusionedit the court wanted to render an analysis that

inc v terri welles inc united states district court for the southern district of california full case name playboy enterprises inc v terri welles inc terri welles steven huntington michael mihalko and pippi inc date decided december   judge sitting judith n keep case holding welles’ nominative use of playboy’s trademarked terms in the metatags of her web site was fair use because web users must utilize identifying words to find their intended web site not all web searches utilizing the words “playboy” “playmate” and “playboy playmate of the year ” are intended to find “playboy” goods or the official “playboy” site there was no likelihood of confusion between defendants website and playboys trademark defendant’s fame and recognition derive from her popularity as a playboy model and playmate of the year thus her use of the trademarked terms was descriptive nominative keywords trademark infringement trademark dilution metatags cyberlaw playboy enterprises inc v welles was a united states district court case between former  playboy playmate of the year pmoy terri welles and playboy enterprises inc in which welles was accused of trademark infringement and trademark dilution in her use of playboys trademarked terms in the metatags of her website contents  facts  opinion of the court  conclusion  references  external links factsedit welles maintained a website which identified her as a former pmoy and displayed the registered trademarked terms playboy playmate of the year and playmate of the month and the unregistered trademark pmoy in metatags wallpaper banner ads and the masthead playboy sued welles claiming both trademark infringement and trademark dilution defendant was featured on the cover of a  playboy magazine defendant was a playboy model and playmate of the year who used these trademarked terms to describe herself via her personal website plaintiff’s sued defendant for defendant’s under two theories trademark infringement and trademark dilution opinion of the courtedit the court held that nominative use a type of fair use for discussing the product itself is permitted where the product or service can not be readily identified without using the trademark ie trademark is descriptive of a person place or product attribute only so much of the mark may be used as is reasonably necessary for identification eg the words may be reasonably used but not the specific font or logo and the user does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder  which applies even if the nominative use is commercial here the ninth circuit court applied the nominative fair use test to the defendant and concluded the defendant’s use of these trademarked items was permissible because there was no other practical way for the defendant to describe herself the plaintiff was relying on the decision in brookfield communications inc v west coast entertainment corp to support the contention that the defendant’s use of playboy trademark in her web site infringes on its trademark by causing likelihood of confusion shown on the basis of initial interest confusion however the court added that the plaintiff’s reliance on brookfield was misplaced none of the cases which brookfield discusses involved fair use defense or a use of trademarks in the metatags which accurately and fairly described the contents of the web page or web site the court defined plaintiff’s use of the theory of ‘initial interest of confusion’ as “confusion of ‘consumer attention even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion” in order for this type confusion to be actionable under the lanham act several factors must be reviewed evidence of the initial interest confusion as being “damaging and wrongful” evidence that confusion between two products “will mistakenly lead the consumer to believe there is some connection between the two and therefore develop an interest in the defendant’s line that it would otherwise not have” or evidence that the “situation offers an opportunity for sale not otherwise available by enabling defendant to interest prospective customers by confusion with the plaintiff’s product” in this case the plaintiff failed to present any of the facts indicating any initial interest confusion was “damaging and wrongful” anyone believes or is likely to believe there is a connection welles’ site and playboy’s welles received “opportunities for sale not otherwise available” by confusing web users or any of welles’ actual customers were in the “appreciable number” or majority of people who when plugging in one of the plaintiff’s trademark terms into a web browser search engine was “looking for playboy’s official site” there was also no evidence welles intended to divert plaintiff’s customers to her web site by trading on playboy’s goodwill this intent was relevant since the court in brookfield stated that in “dr seuss the ninth circuit explicitly recognized that the use of another’s trademark in a manner calculated to capture initial consumer attention even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion may be still an infringement” brookfield at  conclusionedit the court wanted to render an analysis that was flexible and reflective of “emerging technologies” but also wanted to uphold common sense principles of trademark law on appeal the ninth circuit affirmed the district court’s conclusion with respect to welles use of metatags because the court considered the use nominative referencesedit external

enterprises inc pei appeals the district courts grant of summary judgment as to its claims of trademark infringement unfair competition and breach of contract against terri welles terri welles inc pippi inc and welles current and former webmasters steven huntington and michael mihalko we have jurisdiction pursuant to  usc §  and we affirm in part and reverse in part in a separate memorandum disposition we resolve welles crossappeal of the district courts grant of summary judgment as to her counterclaims for defamation intentional infliction of emotional distress unfair competition and interference with prospective economic advantage welles huntington and mihalko also appeal the district courts denial of their requests for attorneys fees we resolve that issue in the memorandum disposition as well i background terri welles was on the cover of playboy in  and was chosen to be the playboy playmate of the year for  her use of the title playboy playmate of the year  and her use of other trademarked terms on her website are at issue in this suit during the relevant time period welles website offered information about and free photos of welles advertised photos for sale advertised memberships in her photo club and promoted her services as a spokesperson a biographical section described welles selection as playmate of the year in  and her years modeling for pei after the lawsuit began welles included discussions of the suit and criticism of pei on her website and included a note disclaiming any association with pei  pei complains of four different uses of its trademarked terms on welles website  the terms playboy and playmate in the metatags of the website  the phrase playmate of the year  on the masthead of the website  the phrases playboy playmate of the year  and playmate of the year  on various banner ads which may be transferred to other websites and  the repeated use of the abbreviation pmoy  as the watermark on the pages of the website pei claimed that these uses of its marks constituted trademark infringement dilution false designation of origin and unfair competition the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment pei appeals the grant of summary judgment on its infringement and dilution claims we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court also granted summary judgment on peis contract claims those claims arose from a contract between pei and a corporation created by welles pippi inc when welles agreed to be playmate of the year in  pippi inc signed a contract with pei the contract contained a term requiring prior written approval from pei before welles made any nonplayboy use of her name with the designation playmate of the year pippi inc was dissolved in  pei argues that pippi inc was welles alter ego and that the terms of the contract are currently enforceable against welles the district court rejected this argument and granted summary judgment on peis contract claims in favor of welles we affirm ii standard of review we review the district courts grant of summary judgment de novo viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law the court must not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter but only determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial iii discussion a trademark infringement except for the use of peis protected terms in the wallpaper of welles website we conclude that welles uses of peis trademarks are permissible nominative uses they imply no current sponsorship or endorsement by pei instead they serve to identify welles as a past pei playmate of the year  we articulated the test for a permissible nominative use in new kids on the block v new america publishing inc the band new kids on the block claimed trademark infringement arising from the use of their trademarked name by several newspapers the newspapers had conducted polls asking which member of the band new kids on the block was the best and most popular the papers use of the trademarked term did not fall within the traditional fair use doctrine unlike a traditional fair use scenario the defendant newspaper was using the trademarked term to describe not its own product but the plaintiffs thus the factors used to evaluate fair use were inapplicable the use was nonetheless permissible we concluded based on its nominative nature we adopted the following test for nominative use first the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark second only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service and third the user must do nothing that would in conjunction with the mark suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder we noted in new kids that a nominative use may also be a commercial one in cases in which the defendant raises a nominative use defense the above threefactor test should be applied instead of the test for likelihood of confusion set forth in sleekcraft the threefactor test better evaluates the likelihood of confusion in nominative use cases when a defendant uses a trademark nominally the trademark will be identical to the plaintiffs mark at least in terms of the words in question thus application of the sleekcraft test which focuses on the similarity of the mark used by the plaintiff and the defendant would lead to the incorrect conclusion that virtually all nominative uses are confusing the threefactor test — with its requirements that the defendant use marks only when no descriptive substitute exists use no more of the mark than necessary and do nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the mark holder — better addresses concerns regarding the likelihood of confusion in nominative use cases we group the uses of peis trademarked terms into three for the purpose of applying the test for nominative use first we analyze welles use of the terms in headlines and banner advertisements we conclude that those uses are clearly nominative second we analyze the use of the terms in the metatags for welles website which we conclude are nominative as well finally we analyze the terms as used in the wallpaper of the website we  conclude that this use is not nominative and remand for a determination of whether it infringes on a pei trademark  headlines and banner advertisements to satisfy the first part of the test for nominative use the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark this situation arises when a trademark also describes a person a place or an attribute of a product and there is no descriptive substitute for the trademark in such a circumstance allowing the trademark holder exclusive rights would allow the language to be depleted in much the same way as if generic words were protectable in new kids we gave the example of the trademarked term chicago bulls we explained that one might refer to the twotime world champions or the professional basketball team from chicago but its far simpler and more likely to be understood to refer to the chicago bulls moreover such a use of the trademark would not imply sponsorship or endorsement of the product because the mark is used only to describe the thing rather than to identify its source thus we concluded such uses must be excepted from trademark infringement law the district court properly identified welles situation as one which must also be excepted no descriptive substitute exists for peis trademarks in this context the court explained there is no other way that ms welles can identify or describe herself and her services without venturing into absurd descriptive phrases to describe herself as the nude model selected by mr hefners magazine as its numberone prototypical woman for the year  would be impractical as well as ineffectual in identifying terri welles to the public we agree just as the newspapers in new kids could only identify the band clearly by using its trademarked name so can welles only identify herself clearly by using peis trademarked title the second part of the nominative use test requires that only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service new kids provided the following examples to explain this element a soft drink competitor would be entitled to compare its product to cocacola or coke but would not be entitled to use cocacolas distinctive lettering similarly in a past case an auto shop was allowed to use the trademarked term volkswagen on a sign describing the cars it repaired in part because the shop did not use volkswagens distinctive lettering style or color scheme nor did he display the encircled vw emblem welles banner advertisements and headlines satisfy this element because they use only the trademarked words not the font or symbols associated with the trademarks  the third element requires that the user do nothing that would in conjunction with the mark suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder as to this element we conclude that aside from the wallpaper which we address separately welles does nothing in conjunction with her use of the marks to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by pei the marks are clearly used to describe the title she received from pei in  a title that helps describe who she is it would be unreasonable to assume that the chicago bulls sponsored a website of michael jordans simply because his name appeared with the appellation former chicago bull similarly in this case it would be unreasonable to assume that pei currently sponsors or endorses someone who describes herself as a playboy playmate of the year in  the designation of the year in our case serves the same function as the former in our example it shows that any sponsorship or endorsement occurred in the past in addition to doing nothing in conjunction with her use of the marks to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by pei welles affirmatively disavows any sponsorship or endorsement her site contains a clear statement disclaiming any connection to pei moreover the text of the site describes her ongoing legal battles with the company for the foregoing reasons we conclude that welles use of peis marks in her headlines and banner advertisements is a nominative use excepted from the law of trademark infringement  metatags welles includes the terms playboy and playmate in her metatags metatags describe the contents of a website using keywords some search engines search metatags to identify websites relevant to a search thus when an internet searcher enters playboy or playmate into a search engine that uses metatags the results will include welles site because welles metatags do not repeat the terms extensively her site will not be at the top of the list of search results applying the threefactor test for nominative use we conclude that the use of the trademarked terms in welles metatags is nominative as we discussed above with regard to the headlines and banner advertisements welles has no practical way of describing herself without using trademarked terms in the context of metatags we conclude that she has no practical way of identifying the content of her website without referring to peis trademarks a large portion of welles website discusses her association with playboy over the years thus the trademarked terms accurately describe the contents of welles website in addition to describing welles forcing welles and others to use absurd turns of phrase in their metatags such as  those necessary to identify welles would be particularly damaging in the internet search context searchers would have a much more difficult time locating relevant websites if they could do so only by correctly guessing the long phrases necessary to substitute for trademarks we can hardly expect someone searching for welles site to imagine the same phrase proposed by the district court to describe welles without referring to playboy — the nude model selected by mr hefners organization yet if someone could not remember her name that is what they would have to do similarly someone searching for critiques of playboy on the internet would have a difficult time if internet sites could not list the object of their critique in their metatags there is simply no descriptive substitute for the trademarks used in welles metatags precluding their use would have the unwanted effect of hindering the free flow of information on the internet something which is certainly not a goal of trademark law accordingly the use of trademarked terms in the metatags meets the first part of the test for nominative use we conclude that the metatags satisfy the second and third elements of the test as well the metatags use only so much of the marks as reasonably necessary and nothing is done in conjunction with them to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder we note that our decision might differ if the metatags listed the trademarked term so repeatedly that welles site would regularly appear above peis in searches for one of the trademarked terms  wallpaperwatermark the background or wallpaper of welles site consists of the repeated abbreviation pmoy  which stands for playmate of the year  welles name or likeness does not appear before or after pmoy  the pattern created by the repeated abbreviation appears as the background of the various pages of the website accepting for the purposes of this appeal that the abbreviation pmoy is indeed entitled to protection we conclude that the repeated stylized use of this abbreviation fails the nominative use test the repeated depiction of pmoy  is not necessary to describe welles playboy playmate of the year  is quite adequate moreover the term does not even appear to describe welles — her name or likeness do not appear before or after each pmoy  because the use of the abbreviation fails the first prong of the nominative use test we need not apply the next two prongs of the test  because the defense of nominative use fails here and we have already determined that the doctrine of fair use does not apply we remand to the district court the court must determine whether trademark law protects the abbreviation pmoy as used in the wallpaper b trademark dilution the district court granted summary judgment to welles as to peis claim of trademark dilution we affirm on the ground that all of welles uses of peis marks with the exception of the use in the wallpaper which we address separately are proper nominative uses we hold that nominative uses by definition do not dilute the trademarks federal law provides protection against trademark dilution the owner of a famous mark shall be entitled subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable to an injunction against another persons commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark dilution which was not defined by the statute has been described by the courts as the gradual whittling away of a trademarks value traditionally courts have recognized two forms of dilution blurring and tarnishment blurring occurs when anothers use of a mark creates the possibility that the mark will lose its ability to serve as a unique identifier of the plaintiffs product tarnishment on the other hand occurs when a famous mark is improperly associated with an inferior or offensive product or service as we recognized in panavision dilution may occur through uses on the internet as well as elsewhere dilution works its harm not by causing confusion in consumers minds regarding the source of a good or service but by creating an association in consumers minds between a mark and a different good or service as explained in a first circuit case in dilution as compared to infringement an entirely different issue is at stake — not interference with the source signaling function but rather protection from an appropriation of or free riding on the investment the trademark holder has made in its trademark thus for example if a cocoa maker began using the rolls royce mark to identify its hot chocolate no consumer confusion would be likely to result few would assume that the car company had expanded into the cocoa making business however the cocoa maker would be capitalizing on the investment the car company had made in its mark consumers readily associate the mark with highly priced automobiles of a certain quality by identifying the cocoa with the rolls royce mark the producer would be capitalizing on consumers association of the mark with high quality items moreover by labeling a different product rolls royce the cocoa company would  be reducing the ability of the mark to identify the mark holders product if someone said im going to get a rolls royce others could no longer be sure the person was planning on buying an expensive automobile the person might just be planning on buying a cup of cocoa thus the use of the mark to identify the hot chocolate although not causing consumer confusion would cause harm by diluting the mark uses that do not create an improper association between a mark and a new product but merely identify the trademark holders products should be excepted from the reach of the antidilution statute such uses cause no harm the antidilution statute recognizes this principle and specifically excepts users of a trademark who compare their product in commercial advertising or promotion to identify the competing goods or services of the owner of the famous mark for the same reason uses in comparative advertising are excepted from antidilution law we conclude that nominative uses are also excepted a nominative use by definition refers to the trademark holders product it does not create an improper association in consumers minds between a new product and the trademark holders mark when welles refers to her title she is in effect referring to a product of peis she does not dilute the title by truthfully identifying herself as its onetime recipient any more than michael jordan would dilute the name chicago bulls by referring to himself as a former member of that team or the twotime winner of an academy award would dilute the award by referring to him or herself as a twotime academy award winner awards are not diminished or diluted by the fact that they have been awarded in the past similarly they are not diminished or diluted when past recipients truthfully identify themselves as such it is in the nature of honors and awards to be identified with the people who receive them of course the conferrer of such honors and awards is free to limit the honorees use of the title or references to the award by contract so long as a use is nominative however trademark law is unavailing the one exception to the above analysis in this case is welles use of the abbreviation pmoy on her wallpaper because we determined that this use is not nominative it is not excepted from the antidilution provisions thus we reverse as to this issue and remand for further proceedings we note that if the district court determines that pmoy is not entitled to trademark protection peis claim for dilution must fail the trademarked term playmate of the year is not identical or nearly identical to the term pmoy therefore use of the term pmoy cannot as a matter of law dilute the trademark playmate of the year c contract the district court granted summary judgment against pei on its contract claims we affirm although we conclude that pei advanced sufficient evidence to establish unity of interest the first prong of the alter ego test we agree with the  district court that pei advanced insufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment on the second prong pei did not show that the facts are such that an adherence to the fiction of the separate existence of the corporation would under the particular circumstances sanction a fraud or promote injustice we note that the alter ego rule is generally applied with caution the district court did not err by declining to apply it here iv conclusion for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district courts grant of summary judgment as to peis claims for trademark infringement and trademark dilution with the sole exception of the use of the abbreviation pmoy we reverse as to the abbreviation and remand for consideration of whether it merits protection under either an infringement or a dilution theory we also affirm as to peis claims for breach of contract in a separate memorandum disposition we resolve
