offers   bottles   bottles   bottles “wonderfully drinkable” gambero rosso when gambero rosso’s annual wine guide drops the italian wine world stops as winemakers scan the influential italian magazine’s list to check their fortunes badia di morrona chianti i sodi del paretaio is a perennial gambero favorite having earned multiple “due bicchieri” “two glasses” honors in addition to praise as a “sincere wonderfully drinkable wine” the wine access clients who have stocked their cellars with past vintages of this “especially good value” with “exceptional breadth on the nose” couldn’t agree more and they’ll be first to claim this gem from the excellent  vintage by the case the land of badia di morrona in the picturesque hills between florence and pisa was first worked by th century benedictine monks today it is owned by count gaslini alberti who has invested a fortune in the winery over the past  years outfitting winemaker corrado dal piaz with a refurbished facility enlarged cellars and new casks and barrels dal piaz is notoriously hard on the badia’s  acres of grapes which soak up the sun on south and southeastern exposed slopes strewn with chunks of white limestone he tightened spacing in the vines orchestrating a darwinian competition that leads to tiny berries of high skintojuice ratio the result is sangiovese of great richness and phenolic complexity ’s long growing season allowed temperamental sangiovese to reach rare almost perfectly uniform maturity the vines stretched deep underground sucking up the mineral imprint of the poor soil putting out a dark crushedredfruit sangiovese infused with garrigue and bracketed by perfectly ripe tannins if you’re looking for vibrancy in your topclass chianti you’ll be hardpressed to find anything quite like this

regions across the wine world different regions are known for both producing different grapes and different styles of wine the distinction between old world wine regions and new world wine regions is particularly important as a sweeping generalization old world regions are known for producing wines that are more austere and terroir driven while new world regions are known for producing wines with greater intensity for example cabernet sauvignon grapes grown in france will likely produce wines marked by earthiness and subtle fruit flavors while cabernet sauvignon grapes grown in california will likely produce wines that are more fruitforward but different wine regions are also often associated with the production of different grapes for example within france bordeaux is associated with red wines made primarily from cabernet sauvignon merlot and cabernet franc grapes while burgundy is associated with red wines made from the pinot noir grape use this page to find toprated wines from wine
