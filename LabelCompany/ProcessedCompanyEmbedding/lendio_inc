sent straight to you edition us arabi australia brasil canada deutschland españa france greece india italia japan korea maghreb méxico québec south africa united kingdom united states close the blog   pm et  updated mar   a business loan thats fast and efficient by kari luckett any type of loan can be a long drawnout process most adults have had the experience of getting a mortgage student loan or something as simple as a credit card or auto loan anyone that has gotten a mortgage in the last decade has experienced the task of coming up with all the proper paperwork and basically go down to their bank or their broker to provide them with that information then the back and forth process ensues that can be quite lengthy so inherently people have this view of lending that its terribly complicated and thats what snapcap is trying to change second turnaround the component pieces snapcap looks at are credit credit score of the individual owner which is a function of any lending decision time in business which has a great deal to do with your continuity and your annual revenue naturally a business that started six months or a year ago is inherently much riskier than one thats been around for two three or ten years the main value provided to borrowers and that snapcap does way better than anyone else right now is nearlive interaction someone who comes to the website completes an application and provides their basic information is often contacted while still on the website snapcap strives to reach out to their users within  seconds of the application its hard to find that type of customer service anywhere else in almost any other industry online and offline for example lets say a business owner visits snapcapcom and needs  within a week for a seasonal inventory spike that they may not have anticipated theyre going to fill out a very basic application provide  days bank data and some additional clarifying information and they will then be on a fasttrack to a loan decision trust in lending snapcap strives to gain the trust of their applicants before asking for detailed personal information with us were looking to provide value to the businesses we give money to so one thing we found that we do particularly well is we get people on the phone said hunter stunzi founder of snapcap we have good quality conversations with our customers educate them on how these loans work and discuss the upside and value of the loan business owners dont have to worry about snapcap collecting their social security numbers tax ids or other intrusive information when they first apply for a business loan online we think its inappropriate and a lot of our competitors do that said stunzi all the user needs to do initially is provide their basic information and a loan advisor will give them a call to explain the process at that point the consumer can decide if its a right fit for them and how to move forward borrowers who pay their loans back on time will be pleased to learn that it doesnt go unnoticed responsible borrowers may be extended greater benefits in the future in the form of larger loans longer terms or something as simple as lower interest rates the key to any business model is to retain good quality users behind the scenes the technology piece is really the best component of snapcaps business thanks to the digital age where everything is readily available online consumers can now provide all the required information very fast once a tax id number has been provided a loan advisor can then do a lexisnexis search and see if the business is in good standing with the secretary of state if they pay taxes and check if theres anything major or derogatory that might make it irresponsible to approve a loan once a borrower submits their social security number snapcap has a pretty good window into their credit history and who they are as a borrower someone who is totally maxed out with all of their trade lines at risk for bankruptcy not paying their mortgage etc wont be an appropriate borrower this type of analysis is very important due to the shortterm loans that are provided which are typically    and month loans what we think weve solved is the ability to acquire users online at a very attractive price point relative to our competitors its not just because were able to spend money more efficiently but were also interacting with the user in a realtime environment that makes them feel valuable follow kari luckett on twitter wwwtwittercomkal kari luckett credit and personal finance writer more

supports small business development and growth this agency does not actually provide the loans it establishes the guidelines for all sba loans and then guarantees a portion of the loan in the case of default which diminishes the risk for its lending partnersquick facts and requirementsloan amountloan term yearspayment frequencymonthlyinterest rateprimetime to funds days   days find your loanbenefits  drawbacks sba financing up to  loan terms up to  years fixed and variable rate options lots of paperwork may require collateral there is a strict acceptance criteriawhat is an sba loan an sba loan is a loan given through the small business association the sba is a government agency built solely for the purpose of assisting small businesses acquire the funding they need recognizing the incredible importance of small businesses on the american economy roughly  of all american businesses are considered “small” the sba was formed to bolster the growth and prosperity of our nation by supporting the small businesses and entrepreneurs who keep the american dream alive and wellin that vein an sba loan is one that has been approved by the sba and in most cases cosponsored by a traditional financial institution the sba provides some of the loan money while the financial institution provides the remainder together meeting the funding needs of the approved loan typically the sba will take on a larger portion of the loan amount and guarantee the loan leaving the financial institution with less riskthe  primary loans from the sba are sba a sba  and sba express loans each of which serve different purposes with different terms rates and loan amount limits therefore which sba loan product you choose should depend heavily on what specific needs you have for your businesswhy choose an sba loan while sba loans are significantly easier to attain than a traditional bank loan they still present the most challenges compared with other noninstitutional lenders for example sba loans are more paperwork intensive typically have a much longer time to funds as well as a higher percentage of rejection than direct online lendersstill sba loans are some of the most soughtafter loans for small businesses because of their benefits the primary benefit of an sba loan is that it allows you to get rates and terms that are comparable to bank loans even when you may not be able to secure a bank loan the sba does this by taking on a larger part of the loan and guaranteeing the loan which makes the loan product significantly more desirable for banks than your loan itself this encourages banks to fight for your business which in turn gives you better rates and terms while still being a very safe investment for banks themselvessba loans are an attractive option for other many other reasons as well for example sba loans all carry monthly payments fixed interest rates long repayment terms and generally make for an excellent step towards improving your credit so you can apply for a bank loan when you need your next round of fundingsba a loans aside from having bank quality rates and terms sba a loans are some of the most versatile loans on the market that means they have virtually no restrictions on usage as long as the money is going to be used for business purposes this includes but is not limited to acquiring a business refinancing startup funds equipment partner buyout and the purchase of real estate because of its unparalleled flexibility sba a loans are by far the most common sba loan on the marketoriginally put together to help specific industries

the loan will be used for along with other details also your loan will be repaid monthlysba  loans for all intensive purposes sba  loans are just like sba a loans only optimized around real estate because of this sba  loans are limited to real estate only however they are some of the best loans on the market when it comes to acquiring major fixed assets expanding or modernizing your current business property for example sba  loans allows you to finance up to  of the appraised property value or  of the outstanding principal whichever is lower they will also include eligible refinancing coststhere are a few eligibility requirements for this kind of loan howeveryour business must operate for profityour business must meet fit and size guidelines set by the sba for the  programtangible net worth can’t exceed  millionnet income can’t exceed  million after taxes loans can’t be given to businesses that speculate loans can’t be given to businesses that invest in rental real estate sba  loans can range between  the loan term is also  years to be repaid in monthly paymentssba express loans in the same way the sba  loans are basically an sba a loan optimized for real estate an sba express loan is the sba loan finetuned for speed and efficiency typically the more expediently a loan is processed the worse the terms and rates and the less desireable the lender sba express loans function to offer funding for businesses that require fast financing while still providing banklike rates and termsin order to decrease approval time the maximum amount of the loan is reduced and the usage is limited to financing equipment debt consolidation and increasing working capital here are some good facts to know about sba express loanscan be preapproved in less than  daysmaximum loan amount of maximum sba guarantee is interest rate is negotiable between borrower and lenderrates can be variable or fixed tied to a prime rate libor or the optional peg raterates may not surpass sba’s maximum rateslenders are not required to take collateral for loans up to  additionally you can get an sba express loan from as little as  up to  and the loan term is typically  years repaid in monthly paymentsgetting an sba loanstep  application the first stage in your loan approval process involves meeting your sba lender and giving him or her enough information to assess your loan application for a preapproval letter items you’ll want to have with you include but are not limited tobusiness and personal financial statements business and personal tax returns for the last three years completed application outlining how the proceeds will be used signed authorization for background and credit checks resumes for your primary managers and your ownersyou can use lendio’s platform to connect with lenders that offer these longterm lowinterest loans in order to expedite the process follow the sba’s recommended business plan outline this will likely save you further questions and time down the linestep  approval depending on the type of loan applied for and your particular circumstance the time to approval will vary however once you have tendered a complete loan package it’s only a matter of time before an approval comes through typically the timeframe from submission of the application to disbursement of funds takes about  days depending on the complexity of the loanif you do receive sba approval your bank will then offer you a proposal it is good practice to apply to more than one bank even if you have the word of a preferred lender some borrowers can get several weeks into the process only to receive a rejection from the bank later though this is a rare scenario taking precautions will minimize the issues you will face along the waystep  underwriting you will enter the underwriting phase after accepting the proposal from the bank for sba loans this phase comprises the exchange of all the information required there is quite a bit of it a complete evaluation and an official approval or decline of your application to improve your chances of approval try to provide as large a down payment as feasible for your company the typical sba loan requires only  percent down but if you can mitigate the bank’s risk with a larger down payment or a personal guarantee particularly if your venture is risky that could help push your loan through the process faster and with less chance of rejectionstep  closing during this period loan terms are settled and signed and guarantee fees and closing costs are paid the length of this process is also determined by the complexity of the arrangement loans under  can take as little as  days from application to funding however they can also take much longer in some circumstances the timeframe is primarily dependant upon how quickly the required documentation can be submitted reviewed and accepted if you choose to work with lendio for your sba loan we make it our duty to advance you from application to funding as quickly as possible regardless of the loan size keep in mind that each loan is different and yours may be difficult or complicated however our funding managers know exactly what is required to expedite the

fill out a very basic application provide  days bank data and some additional clarifying information and they will then be on a fasttrack to a loan decision trust in lending snapcap strives to gain the trust of their applicants before asking for detailed personal information with us were looking to provide value to the businesses we give money to so one thing we found that we do particularly well is we get people on the phone said hunter stunzi founder of snapcap we have good quality conversations with our customers educate them on how these loans work and discuss the upside and value of the loan business owners dont have to worry about snapcap collecting their social security numbers tax ids or other intrusive information when they first apply for a business loan online we think its inappropriate and a lot of our competitors do that said stunzi all the user needs to do initially is provide their basic information and a loan advisor will give them a call to explain the process at that point the consumer can decide if its a right fit for them and how to move forward borrowers who pay their loans back on time will be pleased to learn that it doesnt go unnoticed responsible borrowers may be extended greater benefits in the future in the form of larger loans longer terms or something as simple as lower interest rates the key to any business model is to retain good quality users behind the scenes the technology piece is really the best component of snapcaps business thanks to the digital age where everything is readily available online consumers can now provide all the required information very fast once a tax id number has been provided a loan advisor can then do a lexisnexis search and see if the business is in good standing with the secretary of state if they pay taxes and check if theres anything major or derogatory that might make it irresponsible to approve a loan once a borrower submits their social security number snapcap has a pretty good window into their credit history and who they are as a borrower someone who is totally maxed out with all of their trade lines at risk for bankruptcy not paying their mortgage etc wont be an appropriate borrower this type of analysis is very important due to the shortterm loans that are provided which are typically    and month loans what we think weve solved is the ability to acquire users online at a very attractive price point relative to our competitors its not just because were able to spend money more efficiently but were also interacting with the user in a realtime environment that makes them feel
