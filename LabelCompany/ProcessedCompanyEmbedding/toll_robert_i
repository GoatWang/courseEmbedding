is a hard time to be the biggest luxury home builder in the united states robert toll the ceo of gargantuan toll brothers inc reportedly had his compensation cut from  million in  to  million for the last fiscal year as his company’s net income fell  percent to  million maybe taking the threeunit penthouse at one ten rd toll’s hip rectanglepaneled new condo on third avenue would have made him feel better “i was going to buy the whole floor and reconfigure it i was pretty excited” mr toll said this week “and the boss decided that we weren’t going to move there” the boss is his wife of  years jane “so instead of me moving in reconfiguring and building a luscious st floor i went to plan b” he said “went to my boy and said ‘jacob i think you ought to take advantage of this opportunity it’s a great one’ and he did” according to city records the robert  jane toll  children’s trust “for benefit of” their yearold son jacob paid  for just one of those three penthouse units “of course he didn’t take the whole floor” his father said still isn’t a threebedroom apartment a lot for one something “he’s got a couple of buddies who live with him” mr toll said “lifelong friends from before college” when asked if it was a present he said the trust may or may not have his son’s own money “jake has made some pretty good dough already”—from development work in telluride colo—“and it’s not because of me” now he’s in social work school at nyu a source said the space is over  square feet with a balcony close to  square feet and the toll family didn’t get any special deals the price is in line with other condos in the building the sales manager halstead’s felicia de chabris had no comment when mr toll was asked for a detail about his son’s apartment he said “it’s got really neat views and there is a spectacular shower in it it’s big and has a lot of gadgets in it a lot of not faucets—heads” as for those other two penthouse units is he happy to have sold them off to buyers instead of keeping them in the family “it’s not that it’s small beans for us—nothing is small everything counts—but it’s not material of course to the business that toll does” see also events for wednesday february
