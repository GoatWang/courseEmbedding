as prehistoric art and is not covered here although some precolumbian cultures developed writing during the centuries before the arrival of europeans on grounds of dating these are covered at

papyrus due to the highly religious nature of ancient ancient egyptian civilization many of the great works of ancient egypt depict gods goddesses and pharaohs who were also considered divine ancient egyptian art is characterized by the idea of order clear and simple lines combined with simple shapes and flat areas of color helped to create a sense of order and balance in the art of ancient egypt ancient egyptian artists used vertical and horizontal reference lines to maintain the correct proportions in their work political and religious as well as artistic order was also maintained in egyptian art to clearly define the social hierarchy of a situation figures were drawn to sizes that were based not on their distance from the painters perspective but on relative importance for instance the pharaoh would be drawn as the largest figure in a painting no matter where he was situated and a greater god would be drawn larger than a lesser god symbolism also played an important role in establishing a sense of order symbolism ranging from the pharaohs regalia symbolizing his power to maintain order to the individual symbols of egyptian gods and goddesses was omnipresent in egyptian art animals were usually also highly symbolic figures in egyptian art color as well had extended meaning—blue and green represented the nile and life yellow stood for the sun god and red represented power and vitality the colors in egyptian artifacts have survived extremely well over the centuries because of egypts dry climate despite the stilted form caused by a lack of perspective ancient egyptian art is often highly realistic ancient egyptian artists often show a sophisticated knowledge of anatomy and a close attention to detail especially in their renderings of animals during the th dynasty of egypt a pharaoh by the name of akhenaton took the throne and abolished the traditional polytheism he formed a monotheistic religion based on the worship of aten a sun god artistic change followed political upheaval a new style of art was introduced that was more naturalistic than the stylized frieze favored in egyptian art for the previous  years after akhenatons death however egyptian artists reverted to their old styles faience that was produced in ancient egyptian antiquity as early as  bc was in fact superior to the tinglazed earthenware of the european th century ancient egyptian faience was not made of clay but instead actually of a ceramic composed primarily of quartz mesopotamiaedit main article art of mesopotamia mesopotamia from the greek μεσοποταμία land between the rivers in syriac called ܒܝܬ ܢܗܪܝܢ pronounced beth nahrain land of rivers rendered in arabic as بلاد الرافدين bilād alrāfidayn is a toponym for the area of the tigriseuphrates river system largely corresponding to modernday iraq as well as some parts of northeastern syria southeastern turkey and southwestern iran mesopotamia is often considered the cradle of civilization within its boundaries some of the most ancient civilizations known first developed writing and agriculture many civilizations flourished there leaving behind a rich legacy of ancient art widely considered to be the cradle of civilization bronze age mesopotamia included sumer and the akkadian babylonian and assyrian empires in the iron age it was ruled by the neoassyrian and neobabylonian empires the indigenous sumerians and akkadians including assyrians  babylonians dominated mesopotamia from the beginning of written history c  bc to the fall of babylon in  bc when it was conquered by the achaemenid empire it fell to alexander the great in  bc and after his death it became part of the greek seleucid empire around  bc mesopotamia was under the control of the parthians mesopotamia became a battleground between the romans and parthians with parts of mesopotamia particularly assyria coming under periodic roman control in  ad it fell to the sassanid persians and remained under persian rule until the thcentury arab islamic conquest of the sassanid empire a number of primarily christian native mesopotamian states existed between the st century bc and rd century ad including adiabene oshroene and hatra etymologythe regional toponym mesopotamia from the root words meso  μέσος  middle and potamia  ποταμός  river literally between rivers was coined in the hellenistic period to refer to a broad geographical area without definite boundaries and was probably used by the seleucids the term biritumbirit narim corresponded to a similar geographical concept and was coined during the aramaicization of the region in the th century bc it is widely accepted however that early mesopotamian societies simply referred to the entire alluvium by the sumerian term kalam land more recently terms like greater mesopotamia or syromesopotamia have been adopted to refer to wider geographies corresponding to the near east or middle east these later euphemisms are eurocentric terms attributed to the region in the midst of various thcentury western encroachments summerianedit a chariot and rider from the standard of ur c  bc archaeological evidence attests to their existence during the th millennium bc the sumerians decorated their pottery with cedar oil paints the sumerians also developed jewelry one of the most remarkable artifacts remaining from the sumerian civilization is known as the standard of ur dated to approximately  bc the standard is a wooden box inlaid with shells and lapis lazuli it depicts on one side soldiers presenting their king with prisoners and on the other side peasants presenting him with gifts—stunning evidence that attests to the vibrancy of art in this ancient culture sumer had made many great advances for example there is the wheel which had made transportation easier for the sumerians the arch was the greatest architectural achievement of sumer the ziggurats were pyramidshaped temples the sumerian architects built they believed that the gods lived at the tops of the temples the kings would declare that the gods had sent them to rule and the sumerians would happily follow the kings laws the king had many important jobs like leading the army and looking after irrigation with which sumerians could control rivers the rulers would have battles over land and life went on for the sumerians babylonedit the conquest of sumer and akkad by babylon marks a turning point in the artistic as well as political history of the region the babylonians took advantage of the abundance of clay in mesopotamia to create bricks the use of brick led to the early development of the pilaster and column as well as of frescoes and enameled tiles the walls were brilliantly coloured and sometimes plated with bronze or gold as well as with tiles painted terracotta cones were also embedded in the plaster the sean were also great metalworkers creating functional and beautiful tools with copper it is possible that babylonia was the original home of copperworking which spread westward with the civilization to which it belonged in addition the want of stone in babylonia made every pebble precious and led to a high perfection in the art of gemcutting the arts of babylon also included tapestries and babylonian civilization was from an early date famous for its embroideries and rugs assyriaedit main article art and architecture of assyria assyrian statue like all other kingdoms the babylonian kingdom did not last forever when babylon fell into decline it was eventually conquered by assyria one of its former colonies assyria inherited its arts as well as its empire at first assyrian architects and artists copied babylonian styles and materials but as time went by however the later assyrians began to shake themselves free of babylonian influences the walls of the assyrian palaces were lined with slabs of stone instead of brick and were colored instead of painted as in chaldea in place of the bas relief we have sculpted figures the earliest examples being the statues from girsu which are realistic but somewhat clumsy no remarkable specimens of metallurgic art from early assyria have been found but at a later epoch great excellence was attained in the manufacture of such jewellery as earrings and bracelets of gold copper was also worked with skill the forms of assyrian pottery were graceful the porcelain like the glass discovered in the palaces of nineveh was derived from egyptian originals transparent glass seems to have been first introduced in the reign of sargon ii stone as well as clay and glass were employed in the manufacture of vases vases of hard stone have been disinterred at tello similar to those of the early dynastic period of egypt ashurbanipal had promoted art and culture and had a vast library of cuneiform tablets at nineveh fresco showing three women the minoan civilizationedit main article minoan pottery the greatest civilization of the bronze age was that of the minoans a mercantilist people who built a trading empire from their homeland of crete and from other aegean islands minoan civilization was known for its beautiful ceramics but also for its frescos landscapes and stone carvings in the early minoan period ceramics were characterized by spirals triangles curved lines crosses and fishbone motifs in the middle minoan period naturalistic designs such as fish squid birds and lilies were common in the late minoan period flowers and animals were still the most characteristic but variability had increased the palace style of the region around knossos is characterized by strong geometric simplification of naturalistic shapes and by monochromatic painting the palace at knossos was decorated with frescoes that showed aspects of daily life including court ritual and entertainment such as bullleaping and boxing the minoans were also skilled goldsmiths who created beautiful pendants and masks the mycenaean civilizationedit mycenaean art is close to the minoan and includes many splendid finds from the royal graves most famously the mask of agamemnon a gold funeral mask as may be seen from this item the mycenaeans specialized in goldworking their artworks are known for a plethora of decorative motifs employed at some point in their cultural history the mycenaeans adopted the minoan goddesses and associated these goddesses with their skygod scholars believe that the greek pantheon of deities does not reflect mycenaean religion except for the goddesses and zeus these goddesses however are minoan in origin greek artedit main article ancient greek art kouros of the archaic period thebes archaeological museum ancient greek art includes much pottery sculpture as well as architecture greek sculpture is known for the contrapposto standing of the figures the art of ancient greece is usually divided stylistically into three periods the archaic the classical and the hellenistic the history of ancient greek pottery is divided stylistically into periods the protogeometric the geometric the late geometric or archaic the black figure and the red figure ancient greek art has survived most successfully in the forms of sculpture and architecture as well as in such minor arts as coin design pottery and gem engraving the most prestigious form of ancient greek painting was panel painting now known only from literary descriptions they perished rapidly after the th century ad when they were no longer actively protected today not much survives of greek painting except for late mummy paintings and a few paintings on the walls of tombs mostly in macedonia and italy painting on pottery of which a great deal survives gives some sense of the aesthetics of greek painting the techniques involved however were very different from those used in largeformat painting it was mainly in black and gold and was painted using different paints than the ones used on walls or wood because it was a different surface indiaedit main articles indian painting and indian sculpture fresco from ajanta caves c  a sculpture of siddhārtha gautama the founder of buddhism the first sculptures in india date back to the indus valley civilization some  years ago where small stone carvings and bronze castings have been discovered later as hinduism buddhism and jainism developed further india produced some of the most intricate bronzes in the world as well as unrivaled temple carvings some in huge shrines such as the one at ellora the ajanta caves in maharashtra india are rockcut cave monuments dating back to the second century bce and containing paintings and sculpture considered to be masterpieces of both buddhist religious art and universal pictorial art persia iranedit main article persian art after  years the ruins of persepolis still inspire visitors from far and near iran succeeded to the hittite empire and initially took much of its artistic styles from them huge palaces in rural settings often worked on by craftsmen drawn from other nations subject or not were distinctive features after the empire was decisively overthrown by alexander the great a new sassanian culture emerged notable for palaces and metalwork the capitals susa persepolis ecbatana and estakhr have revealed much rich persian art romeedit main article roman art further information pompeian styles and roman wall painting  bc ad it is commonly said that roman art was derivative from greek and etruscan art indeed the villas of the wealthy romans unearthed in pompeii and herculaneum show a strong predilection for all things greek many of the most significant greek artworks survive by virtue of their roman interpretation and imitation roman artists sought to commemorate great events in the life of their state and to glorify their emperors as well as record the inner life of people and express ideas of beauty and nobility their busts and especially the images of individuals on gravestones are very expressive and lifelike finished with skill and panache in greece and rome wall painting was not considered as high art the most prestigious form of art besides sculpture was panel painting ie tempera or encaustic painting on wooden panels unfortunately since wood is a perishable material only a very few examples of such paintings have survived namely the severan tondo from circa  ad a very routine official portrait

archaeological museum ancient greek art includes much pottery sculpture as well as architecture greek sculpture is known for the contrapposto standing of the figures the art of ancient greece is usually divided stylistically into three periods the archaic the classical and the hellenistic the history of ancient greek pottery is divided stylistically into periods the protogeometric the geometric the late geometric or archaic the black figure and the red figure ancient greek art has survived most successfully in the forms of sculpture and architecture as well as in such minor arts as coin design pottery and gem engraving the most prestigious form of ancient greek painting was panel painting now known only from literary descriptions they perished rapidly after the th century ad when they were no longer actively protected today not much survives of greek painting except for late mummy paintings and a few paintings on the walls of tombs mostly in macedonia and italy painting on pottery of which a great deal survives gives some sense of the aesthetics of greek painting the techniques involved however were very different from those used in largeformat painting it was mainly

greek and etruscan art indeed the villas of the wealthy romans unearthed in pompeii and herculaneum show a strong predilection for all things greek many of the most significant greek artworks survive by virtue of their roman interpretation and imitation roman artists sought to commemorate great events in the life of their state and to glorify their emperors as well as record the inner life of people and express ideas of beauty and nobility their busts and especially the images of individuals on gravestones are very expressive and lifelike finished with skill and panache in greece and rome wall painting was not considered as high art the most prestigious form of art besides sculpture was panel painting ie tempera or encaustic painting on wooden panels unfortunately since wood is a perishable material only a very few examples of such paintings have survived namely the severan tondo from circa  ad a very routine official portrait from some provincial government office and the wellknown fayum mummy portraits all from roman egypt and almost certainly not of the highest contemporary quality the portraits were attached to burial mummies at the face from which almost all have now been detached they usually depict a single person showing the head or head and upper chest viewed frontally the background is always monochrome sometimes with decorative elements in terms of artistic tradition the images clearly derive more from grecoroman traditions than egyptian ones they are remarkably realistic though variable in artistic quality and may indicate the similar art which was widespread elsewhere but did not survive a few portraits painted on glass and medals from the later empire have survived as have coin portraits some of which are considered very realistic as well pliny the younger complained of the declining state of roman portrait art the painting of portraits which used to transmit through the ages the accurate likenesses of people has entirely gone

article chinese art prehistoric artwork such as painted pottery in neolithic china can be traced back to the yangshao culture and longshan culture of the yellow river valley during chinas bronze age chinese of the ancient shang dynasty and zhou dynasty produced multitudes of artistic bronzeware vessels for practical purposes but also for religious ritual and geomancy the earliest surviving chinese paintings date to the warring states period and they were on silk as well as lacquerwares a qin chinese terracotta soldier and his horse rd century bc one of ancient chinas most famous artistic relics remains the terracotta warriors an assembly of  individual and lifesize terracotta figures such as infantry horses with chariots and cavalry archers and military officers buried in the tomb of qin shi huang the first qin emperor in  bc this tradition was carried into the subsequent han dynasty although their tombs contained miniature versions of the soldiers in addition to domestic
