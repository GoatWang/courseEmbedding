reminder todays call is being recorded at this time it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your to host david fischel chairman and acting ceo of stereotaxis please go ahead sirdavid leo fischel stereotaxis inc  chairman and acting ceo thank you operator good morning everyone im joined today by marty stammer our chief financial officer as this is my first opportunity to speak with you following my appointment to the role of ceo in february and given that there may be new investors on the call i want to take the occasion to provide an overview of the company and my view of the opportunity ahead of us marty will then walk through the first quarter financial results i will then provide brief additional commentary on the financial results and expectations for the remainder of the year before opening the call to questionsstereotaxis has developed and is commercializing a suite of robotic technologies that enable better treatment of cardiac arrhythmia today i will focus exclusively on the current business and opportunity in cardiac ablation but it is important to remember that robotic magnetic navigation is a platform technology that can be developed and employed in a wide range of other clinical applicationsour products include a robotic magnetic navigation system composed of  magnets next to the operating table on which the patient lies during the procedure a physician sits behind a large screen computer control station and using a mouse and very intuitive interface manipulates those magnets to adjust the magnetic field around the patient this allows the physician to precisely direct and steer a cardiac ablation catheter that has a magnet at its tipthis differs significantly from traditional nonrobotic procedures where a physician stands at a patient bedside and manipulates a catheter by making very fine movements of his or her fingers and wrists at the catheter base in order to manipulate the catheter tipthese physicians are amazingly skilled but the technique to manipulate manual catheters is akin to gardening delicate flowers by holding a hose from its base the manual catheter needs rigidity and internal wires to allow the movements at the base to translate into movements at the tipread morein contrast our robotic magnetic technology controls a gentler catheter from the tip allowing for unmatched precision reach and stability the removal of pull wires and structural rigidity from the catheter shaft makes a magnetic catheter exceptionally safe for patients reducing perforations and other adverse eventsin addition for physicians a robotic procedure is performed seated unscrubbed and protected from radiation exposure a recent publication demonstrated that  of brain tumors in interventionalist physicians were found in the left side of the brain as opposed to the right side as they usually stand with their left side closer to the xray machineive had a chance to speak with dozens of physicians that use our products and have been encouraged by the large group of passionate physicians that find significant value in our technology that passion comes from the way our products enable them to effectively and efficiently perform a wide range of procedures that otherwise would not be done as well or could not be done at allive spoken with leading university hospitals that perform all of their ventricular procedures robotically and that dread a ventricular procedure being scheduled when the robotic lab is already in use ive spoken with global leaders in pediatric and congenital cardiac ablation who describe being able to treat patients that otherwise could not be treated with manual catheterson the other end of the spectrum in less complicated and more common atrial fibrillation procedures ive spoken with physicians who are able to do pulmonary vein isolation as quickly as balloon ablation but with better and more individualized therapy they do all these procedures with improved safety for patients given our firstinclass safety profile and with improved safety and comfort for themselves and their professional staff given the reduced radiation and orthopedic burdenphysician passion and interest in robotics has led to just recently the establishment of a physicianled society dedicated to advancing clinical science and awareness of robotics in electrophysiology the inaugural meeting of the european chapter of the society took place last fall and the inaugural meeting of the north american chapter will be taking place tomorrow in chicago in advance of the heart rhythm society conference with a live case being performed by dr william spear at advocate christ medical centerlooking at where we stand from a broader strategic perspective we are in a great situation with a highly differentiated product in a large growing market the cardiac ablation market is among the most attractive medical device market both in terms of size and growththere will be an estimated  billion in sales this year of products used in cardiac ablation procedures and the market has grown consistently at a doubledigit annual rate this growth is being driven by the increased incidence of arrhythmias with age and in aging population along with increased clinical evidence and improved technologies we have an extremely small share of this market and even with limited market share could have a very significant and successful businessour product is a differentiated competitor in this attractive market it is robust and has been used in nearly  procedures globally it has been clinically validated with hundreds of peer review publications it is the most effective and sometimes only option for the most complex ablation cases it is the safest product for both patients and physicians and it is the only product with opportunity to be fully automated and thus provide efficient individualized therapy for the less complex ablation casesfor companies operating in this attractive endovascular cardiac ablation market the challenge over the next few years will be maintaining differentiation and avoiding commoditization of their products this risk is becoming clear by the convergence of features of mapping systems and ablation catheters in such a market the underlying technology of stereotaxis provides significant advantagesfirst improvements in manual ablation technologies can be added in a synergistic fashion to the robotic platform the combination of technologies would allow for the respective clinical benefits to be provided to patients and physicians in an additive fashionsecond our proprietary robotic technology has a differentiated mechanism of action we have no robotic competition in the cardiac ablation field and stand head and shoulders above any other robotic technology for endovascular procedures in terms of elegance capability clinical value and realworld validationin a broader sense the tide of history is in our favor as robotics and automation are currently transforming a wide range of industries including several surgical specialtiesso i described us having a highly sophisticated and differentiated robotic product that has been validated in nearly  procedures and hundreds of peer review publications and that provides clinical benefits to patients and physicians in a very large growing market but despite that amazing setup stereotaxis has not been a successful company for the past several years it still has very little market share of the cardiac ablation market and at its current stock price of approximately  it has roughly a fully diluted enterprise value of  million or about x salesunderstanding the cause of this lack of progress would be a perfect business school case study but in abridged form it was due to several factors when the product was initially launched in the  to  time frame it saw rapid adoption but the device was slow like a computer where each time the mouse was moved there was a lag time of several secondsthe premature launch of the technology disappointed many users and was exacerbated by a disproportionate focus on selling new systems rather than training physicians and helping them build successful robotic practices that black cloud of the initial wave of disappointed users has haunted the company ever sincethe company also poorly managed its relationships with strategic partners these dynamics led to a vicious cycle of reduced system placements internal restructuring and reductions in sales force size as well as diluted financings and valuation destructionthe challenge now is one of perception despite having a very robust and efficacious system there are many physicians and industry participants who perceive the product with the negative connotation of the initial launch they also misinterpret the business struggles of stereotaxis as a reflection of limited physician interest and clinical utilityovercoming negative momentum and changing perception is difficult but every employee and board member of stereotaxis is committed to rebuilding the company in a way that will allow for the achievement of our potential we intend to pursue the following in a determined fashionfirst we want to build a more customeroriented business we are working to improve every aspect of our interaction with physicians and hospitals in training we are using new simulators that allow for more opportunities to train physicians we have a responsive training team and we will explore mechanisms by which we can more quickly ascertain when a physician or operating room staff could benefit from additional trainingby supporting the activities of physicians societies we can help ensure increased clinical literature and peertopeer learning of best practices takes place we are also conducting a welldesigned clinical trial to demonstrate superiority of robotic ablation versus manual ablation in ischemic ventricular tachycardia and enrolled more patients this quarter than in all of last full yearour field clinical support team is augmented by a remote clinical support team that provides greater capability to proactively support procedures in realtime when our field team is unavailable we are also developing tools by which robotic ablation practices can better promote their technological and clinical leadership to attract referral physicians patients and ultimately grow their practicesthe second broad area of focus that we are pursuing is that we want to improve our technology with significant innovation our econtact module will be launched in europe momentarily it provides physicians with continuous intraoperative feedback during the ablation procedure if the ablation catheter is in contact with the heart tissue we are working on the clinical and regular requirements to bring econtact to the uswe intend to release software and hardware upgrades to our existing customers late this year and well provide  and well provide some of the initial software modules as well as the computing processing power that lays the foundation for our progress towards full automationas described earlier our robotic technology can be combined in an additive fashion to the technological advances found in manual ablation catheters and cardiac mapping technologies were exploring the best way forward to combine these technologiesour longerterm aspiration is to provide physicians the ability to do automotive procedures allowing physicians to focus on the individualized design and treatment of patients with arrhythmias rather than on the manipulation of catheterswith that overview provided marty will now discuss the first quarter in more detailmartin c stammer stereotaxis inc  cfo thanks david and good morning everyone revenue for the first quarter totaled  million down from  million in the year ago quarter and  million in the fourth quarter recurring revenue in the quarter was  million up from  million in the prior year quarter and  million in the fourth quarter system revenue was  all related to odyssey solution sales and down from  million in the first quarter of  and from  in the fourth quarterat quarterend our backlog was  million recurring revenue growth benefited from robust march procedure volume with the company recording the highest monthly global procedure volume in over  years and highest north american procedure volume in over  years system revenue weakness was caused by lack of any niobe system sales and the exploration of an odyssey distribution agreement in gross margin in the first quarter was  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenue in the year ago first quarter and  million or  of revenue in the fourth quarter of operating expenses in the first quarter were  million compared to  million in the year ago quarter and  million in the fourth quarter operating loss was  million in the  first quarter compared to  million in the prior year first quarter and  million in the fourth quarterinterest expense was less than  in the first quarter and prior year fourth quarter down from  in the year ago quarter as a result of the extinguishment of the healthcare royalty partners debt in q of net income for the first quarter was  million compared to a net loss of  million reported for the first quarter of  excluding marktomarket warrant revaluation we would have reported a net loss of  million for the  first quarter compared to a net loss of  million for the  first quarterthe weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the first quarters of  and  totaled  million and  million respectively cash burn for the first quarter was  million compared to  million in the year ago first quarter and  in the preceding fourth quarter cash used in the first quarter was impacted by approximately  million in nonrecurring paymentsat march  we had cash and cash equivalents of  million and unused borrowing capacity of  million on our silicon valley bank revolver for total liquidity of  millioni will now hand the call back over to daviddavid leo fischel stereotaxis inc  chairman and acting ceo thank you marty as marty described revenue in the first quarter reflects a nadir in system sales with no niobe sales and minimal sales of other systemswhile system sales were disappointing im proud of our clinical teams performance in the latter part of the quarter and with the growth shown in recurring revenue which benefited from the broadbased contribution of many geographies and teams we do expect to see system orders and sales in the remainder of the year given the pipeline of interested customers for the full year  we expect revenue to exceed  millionwe also intend to be approximately cash flow neutral for the remainder of  benefiting from system sales in the second half of the year and minimum purchase commitments from international distribution partners this would allow us to end the year with over  million in cash without the use of our existing credit facility or pursuing other debt or equity financingim proud that ernst  young our audit firm provided stereotaxis with a clean going concern opinion in our form k the first time such an opinion has been provided since one of our primary goals for the year is to develop and initiate a longterm product innovation plan prior to yearend we are exploring the various parts of such a plan and the best way to progress and well provide additional commentary when appropriatethat concludes our prepared remarks operator can you please open the line to questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructions and we will take a question from steve emerson from emerson investment groupj steven emerson emerson investment group  founder first of all congratulations on your rapidly going to cash neutral and positive thank you for going to lower salary levels both at the chief executive and by example the board of directors in your guidance of  million how much would be system sales and how much would be the rest of your offeringsdavid leo fischel stereotaxis inc  chairman and acting ceo steve thanks for the questions and thank you for the comments on the ceo and board compensation we would estimate having approximately flat recurring revenue for the year which would take us to about the  million or  millionorso recurring revenue and then the remainder would be system saleswe have certain commitments from international distribution partners that would make up some of the system sales and then we have a pipeline of interested hospitals in the us and europe each individual hospital in that pipeline carries a probability and a risk that it doesnt fall through but given the amount of active sites out there on a probabilityweighted basis we think that we will have system sales in the us and europej steven emerson emerson investment group  founder excellent and in terms of the going ahead road map are there any particular dates or time objectives when we might be able to present the fully automated device what kind of timing and my apologies if you went through this earlier in the calldavid leo fischel stereotaxis inc  chairman and acting ceo we didnt provide more clarity in the call but obviously that is important i know that stereotaxis has been hampered over the years by the lack of a significant innovationin terms of automation i would look at the progress towards automation as a methodical march forward it wont be one step that brings us to final automation it will rather be a congruence of multiple software modules and capabilities that combined provide a much more reliable reproducible and rapid automationwe do actually have automation modules currently available to physicians they just are not yet reliable reproducible and rapid enough to justify daily usage that is a longerterm endeavor though some of those modules are coming out as we speakso in the prepared remarks i mentioned our econtact module which will be launched in europe momentarily that is a key component to helping improve automation algorithms and later this year we do plan to launch both hardware capabilities that will be added to all of our existing sites and some additional software modules that will again provide the base on which to provide future automation modulesand so we see that as a methodical march forward that will take some time to come to its full fruition but that benefits incrementally along the wayand then in terms of a longterm innovation plan that is something that we are exploring now the best way forward i think that involves potentially collaboration with other industry participants or can be done internally but its worthwhile to spend the time looking at those options and evaluating all the options with full knowledge and making that decision once we have all the information in front of us and can make the best decision for the companyoperator operator instructions and we will take our next question from andrew inaudibleunidentified analyst great job on the quarter i just kind of say as a longterm holder of your stock i sense a great amount of enthusiasm and refreshing comments with respect to both the business as well as strategic directives that you have so eloquently mapped out over the next yeari just had one quick question regarding the uptick that weve seen in march is there any color you can give on that as far as initiatives that have been taking place or behind the scenes how thats working out as you kind of look forward to the rest of the year and whether or not thats something we should be counting on or its just an anomaly in the marketdavid leo fischel stereotaxis inc  chairman and acting ceo sure let me try to answer that a bit and thanks for the question the strong procedure volume in the month of march was broadbased so many geographies customers and team members contributed to the strengthour sales team did a great job and im proud of the impact of their energy and professionalism they were supported by a few new tools including the simulators which i described in our prepared remarks and some clinical literature that allowed them to better engage with physiciansi also think that the greater engagement of our management team with customers had some impact in that month given the transition that took place a bit earlierin terms of april we dont yet have full data for the month but it was not as strong as march there is obviously natural volatility in monthly and quarterly procedure volumes and so were working on several initiatives to strengthen our sales organization and help our physician customers grow their robotic ablation practices those take some time to put in place and show an impact but those are the types of activities that i think should help us progress towards consistent revenue growthoperator and now we will hear from ronald davis who is a private investorronald davis  private investor thank you gentlemen appreciate the information i have several questions related to sales if i could ask them all at once i hope you dont mind and maybe to get  answer the questions are number one how many sales people do you have on your staff and then once you have a trained salesman how many  whats the estimate of the number of calls and lead time to a po and once a po is in hand how much time is required to actually deliver the productand how many systems would an average hospital need to do these ablations i dont know whether its one system or more not being knowledgeable in the industry and i think next to last or last your estimated sales associated with one system what kind of revenue would you estimate a system once its placed in a hospital can generate and lastly what competition  what type of competition actually exists for your productdavid leo fischel stereotaxis inc  chairman and acting ceo okay those are all great questions i hope we actually got them all down so let  well try to answer some of them briefly and obviously if you want a longer discussion after the call we can take it also offline let me try going backwardsso in terms of competition there is no robotic competition in the cardiac ablation space but there are significant competitors large companies johnson  johnson abbott medtronic boston scientific are  and a private company based in europe are the primary competitors in this marketplace they each have manual ablation catheters which are manipulated by a physicians hand holding on to the base of the catheter but they have obviously significant organizations and they do advance their technology on a regular basis and they are our primary competitorsin terms of how much revenue should be generated from a system that is installed we generate revenue both per procedure and on service contracts that maintain the uptime of our systems and that provide with those service contracts continuous software and hardware improvements as they come outso for example our econtact module that would be launched in europe that will go  that will be included for all existing customers as part of their longterm service contract we would generally estimate depending on the region somewhere  and depending on the procedure volumes somewhere between  and  sometimes more per hospital in terms of annual recurring revenuein terms of how many systems are usually installed in a hospital we  its almost in all of our customers its one system per hospital a system can be used obviously  if its being used actively can be used a few hundred times a year and we dont have  we might have  hospital or  hospitals that have  systems at their hospital but otherwise our installed base is all  system per hospitalin terms of sales people it sounded like what you were asking was on the capital sales side regarding how many sales people are focused on system sales  new system sales there  it is a  ill  its a little bit difficult to answer that with pure numbers because we have both certain sales reps that are focused on new system sales and we have sales reps that are focused on driving clinical adoption and in different geographies there is sometimes overlap between the individuals who are focused on clinical and on system salesin the us we have  individuals who are focused exclusively on system sales and they are also supported by our clinical sales directors and our regional directors and our head of sales who while they have a clinical focus also oversee and participate in driving system salesin europe theres much more overlap where the clinical sales people are also very much involved in system sales in each of their own geographies we have  marty will jump in but we have approximately  full allin sales team we have approximately  or  and a bit individuals in the us and approximatelymartin c stammer stereotaxis inc  cfo david leo fischel stereotaxis inc  chairman and acting ceo   or so in europe and that includes clinical and system salesmartin c stammer stereotaxis inc  cfo and thats where were looking at from a direct sales perspective we also  in other markets outside of north america and western europe we have a distributor model that we work through so that makes the number i guess a little murkier but does expand our reach significantlydavid leo fischel stereotaxis inc  chairman and acting ceo what the  does that answer some of your questions and sorry if there were additional ones if you could please just repeat themronald davis  private investor no youve answered my questions im just a little concerned with a total of  system sales rep how you really anticipate increasing your growth significantlydavid leo fischel stereotaxis inc  chairman and acting ceo so we dont need significant system sales to reach our guidance for the year and i believe in growing the business incrementally and so as you see success you invest further in that success to fuel the momentumso i agree with you its unlikely that were going to see  system sales this year off of a sales team in the us of  focused on system sales but i think that you can show some and incrementally that is all positive in terms of showing growth and building momentum and as we show that momentum obviously we would like to invest more in growing the team and in growing our capabilitiesmartin c stammer stereotaxis inc  cfo just to clarify that would be  in north america and then worldwide depending on how you allocate people it would be closer to  to  plus a distributor networkronald davis  private investor are these people trained inhouse to adapt to your projectmartin c stammer stereotaxis inc  cfo yes they are they actually receive extensive training on our product and the individuals that were looking for when we are recruiting are experienced med tech salespeople so our team typically has anywhere from  to  years of experience of previous med device sales before they come here and then we do give them comprehensive training on our productronald davis  private investor if you were to receive a purchase order from a hospital tomorrow how long would it take for you to actually deliver the productmartin c stammer stereotaxis inc  cfo typically thats a pretty short time line i think your other question was around lead time for projects there are a number of things that have to line up for a system sale to take place and theres usually a construction time line and this is  its usually part of a larger projectin general what weve said is the lead time from kind of earliest discussions until po and then shipment which po and shipment are generally pretty close together is approximately  to  monthsdavid leo fischel stereotaxis inc  chairman and acting ceo we can ship fairly quickly sometimes hospitals will provide a purchase order but will only request to receive the system several months out depending on when they want the system installed and so thats  its largely driven by the customers plans and desires rather than by our inability to provide a product when its demandedso if a system is ordered and they would like to receive it in short order we can achieve that sometimes you will receive purchase orders that the hospital only wants to receive the system several months later and then we will obviously follow their directivesoperator operator instructions with no additional questions in the queue i will turn the call back over to david fischel for closing remarksdavid leo fischel stereotaxis inc  chairman and acting ceo thanks thank you everyone for joining us this morning we look forward to updating you on our progress over the rest of the year and we will speak with you again in augustoperator and with that ladies and gentlemen
