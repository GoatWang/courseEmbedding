this code of ethics the code is for the investment companies within the complex registered with the united states securities  exchange commission sec collectively ft funds applies to each ft funds principal executive officers principal financial officer and principal accounting officer the covered officers each of whom are set forth in exhibit a for the purpose of promoting o honest and ethical conduct including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships o full fair accurate timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that a registrant files with or submits to the sec and in other public communications made by or on behalf of the ft funds o compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations o the prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to an appropriate person or persons identified in the code and o accountability for adherence to the code each covered officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest ii covered officers should handle ethically actual and apparent conflicts of interest overview a conflict of interest occurs when a covered officers private interest interferes with the interests of or his service to the ft funds for example a conflict of interest would arise if a covered officer or a member of his family receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with the ft funds certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between covered officers and the ft funds and already are subject to conflict of interest provisions in the investment company act of  investment company act and the investment advisers act of  investment advisers act for example covered officers may not individually engage in certain transactions such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property with the ft funds because of their status as affiliated persons of the ft funds the ft funds and the investment advisers compliance programs and procedures are designed to prevent or identify and correct violations of these provisions this code does not and is not intended to repeat or replace these programs and procedures and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this code although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit conflicts arise from or as a result of the contractual relationship between the ft funds the investment advisers and the fund administrator of which the covered officers are also officers or employees as a result this code recognizes that the covered officers will in the normal course of their duties whether formally for the ft funds for the adviser the administrator or for all three be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the adviser administrator and the ft funds the participation of the covered officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the ft funds the adviser and the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the covered officers of their duties as officers of the ft funds thus if performed in conformity with the provisions of the investment company act and the investment advisers act such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically in addition it is recognized by the ft funds boards of directors boards that the covered officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other codes other conflicts of interest are covered by the code even if such conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the investment company act and the investment advisers act the following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the code but covered officers should keep in mind that these examples are not exhaustive the overarching principle is that the personal interest of a covered officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the ft funds each covered officer must o not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the ft funds whereby the covered officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the ft funds o not cause the ft funds to take action or fail to take action for the individual personal benefit of the covered officer rather than the benefit the ft funds o not retaliate against any other covered officer or any employee of the funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that are made in good faith o report at least annually the following affiliations or other relationships o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are required to file reports with the sec o any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent directors o any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent public accounting firm and o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any ft fund that will benefit the officer not including benefits derived from the advisory subadvisory distribution or service agreements with affiliates of franklin resources there are some conflict of interest situations that should always be approved in writing by fts general counsel or deputy general counsel if material examples of these include o service as a director on the board of any public or private company o the receipt of any gifts in excess of  o the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the ft funds has current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is business related reasonable in cost appropriate as to time and place and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety notwithstanding the foregoing the covered officers must obtain prior approval for any entertainment with a value in excess of  o any ownership interest in or any consulting or employment relationship with any of the ft funds service providers other than an investment adviser principal underwriter administrator or any affiliated person thereof o a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions transaction charges or spreads paid by the ft funds for effecting portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the covered officers employment such as compensation or equity ownership fts general counsel or deputy general counsel will provide a report to the ft funds audit committee of any approvals granted at the next regularly scheduled meeting iii disclosure and compliance o each covered officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the ft funds o each covered officer should not knowingly misrepresent or cause others to misrepresent facts about the ft funds to others whether within or outside the ft funds including to the ft funds directors and auditors and to governmental regulators and selfregulatory organizations o each covered officer should to the extent appropriate within his area of responsibility consult with other officers and employees of the ft funds the adviser and the administrator with the goal of promoting full fair accurate timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the ft funds file with or submit to the sec and in other public communications made by the ft funds and o it is the responsibility of each covered officer to promote compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws rules and regulations iv reporting and accountability each covered officer must o upon adoption of the code or thereafter as applicable upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the board that he has received read and understands the code see exhibit b o annually thereafter affirm to the board that he has complied with the requirements of the code and o notify fts general counsel or deputy general counsel promptly if he knows of any violation of this code failure to do so is itself is a violation of this code fts general counsel and deputy general counsel are responsible for applying this code to specific situations in which questions are presented under it and have the authority to interpret this code in any particular situation however the independent directors of the respective fund will consider any approvals or waivers sought by any chief executive officers of the funds the ft funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this code o fts general counsel or deputy general counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential violations reported to him o if after such investigation fts general counsel or deputy general counsel believes that no violation has occurred fts general counsel is not required to take any further action o any matter that fts general counsel or deputy general counsel believes is a violation will be reported to the independent directors of the appropriate ft fund o if the independent directors concur that a violation has occurred it will inform and make a recommendation to the board of the appropriate funds which will consider appropriate action which may include review of and appropriate modifications to applicable policies and procedures notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board or a recommendation to dismiss the covered officer o the independent directors will be responsible for granting waivers as appropriate and o any changes to or waivers of this code will to the extent required are disclosed as provided by sec rules v other policies and procedures this code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the ft funds for purposes of section  of the sarbanesoxley act and the rules and forms applicable to registered investment companies there under insofar as other policies or procedures of the ft funds the ft funds advisers principal underwriter or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the covered
