life insurance company that is maintained separately from the insurers general assets separate accounts were originally established in response to federal securities laws for investmentlinked variable annuities although it took many years the application of separate accounts has dramatically expanded beyond this simple product design product development has resulted with an array of “hybrid” products—products that overlay traditional insurance company guarantees eg mortality morbidity etc being allocated to the separate account investment portfolio the use of separate accounts by insurers has evolved rapidly over the past  years in response to recommendations to clarify information pertaining to separate account products and related separate account assets detailed information is available in the statutory financial statements distinct filings for separate products that are “insulated” or “not insulated” from the general account creditors when completing the insulated separate
