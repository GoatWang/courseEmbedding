innovations inc success story luna innovations inc success story luna innovations inc success story sep                        source sbir success stories click here to go to the source landing a jet fighter on an aircraft carrier is often cited as one of the most perilous maneuvers naval and marine corps pilots will ever have to perform throw in unpredictable weather conditions like wind and rain that often cloud the windshield and reduce visibility and now the task is even more arduous the us navy sought a solution by releasing a small business innovation research sbir solicitation to develop a durable rain repellent coating for aircraft that would increase visibility during takeoff and landing virginiabased luna innovations won the sbir award and went on to develop a proven solution that could work on any type of hard surface a phase ii project soon followed and it wasnt long before the air force signed on to partner with luna on an f canopy application we looked at the potential for the technology and knew it was something the military needed but the possibilities were also very broad commercially explains luna innovations ceo my e chung we have leveraged multiple sbir awards to develop and advance this technology and that was one of the keys to our success recognizing the need to find the right partner to bring the technology to market luna licensed the durable surface transparent coating to ultratech international for multiple commercial applications under the tradename gentoo™ coatings licensing is a key revenue generator for the company bringing in  million in  a  increase from the previous year a potential application luna is exploring for its related omniphobic water and oil repellent textile coating technology licensed to ultratech under the evershield™ name is in the area of army uniforms the depar™ent of defense is exploring options for use in the battlefield to keep water oil and other fluids off the soldiers uniforms this textile application could have broad commercial potential especially within the multibillion dollar us laundry industry although luna creates and develops a broad range of technologies across multiple platforms including sensors materials and health sciences it has built its reputation by being the preeminent developer and manufacturer of fiber optic solutions to clients within the telecommunications medical energy aerospace automotive defense and composites industries in the fiber optic arena luna provides diagnostic and test instrumentation for the telecommunications industry enabling complete characterization of optical components assemblies and shorthaul networks the companys solutions provide cost and time savings in development production and maintenance of nextgeneration optical equipment drawing from this core competency luna developed a patented process to track the shape of the fiber this process ended up having huge commercial potential in the robotic surgical industry since the tip of the fiber could communicate to the doctor exactly where that instrument was within a patient say for example at the end of a catheter it eliminates the need for patients to be hooked up to xrays and mris during surgical procedures creating an unparalleled value proposition to both the doctor and the patient in  luna sold its medical shapesensing technology to intuitive surgical in a deal valued up to  million thats really the value of our team we look at the market perspective explains james garrett vice president of technology development for luna innovations we have built a very strong research institution and have refined our focus and recently have added marketing capabilities to our technology development division that was a major shift in how we approach things  how are we going to take these efforts and commercialize them that question is shaping the whole strategy of our division another part of that strategy centered on a recent merger with advanced photonix inc api to better position luna for improved profitability the combined company which retained the luna name has significant intellectual property protection for the many technologies in its combined product portfolio with over  patents and patent applications with a shared vision the decision to merge was a relatively simple one as the merged company can now offer a more comprehensive and therefore a more compelling value proposition to the industries it serves luna is looking forward to a bright and successful future the merger with api gives us a real kick start with a solid vision in terms of continually expanding and marketing our core technologies added chung led by garrett the technology division is honing in on commercial applications and opportunities that help the company to guide its selections in the sbir sector one of those selections continues to draw upon lunas coating technologies for a recent sbir phase ii project with the navy the fleets cable strands used to tow the aqsa minehunting sonar system from the ship are made from a type of stainless steel that under normal circumstances exhibits excellent corrosion resistance and strength over a wide temperature range however the cables are experiencing early life corrosion problems due to salt water deposit buildup that occurs over repeated operations and subsequent system stowage to achieve the corrosion and abrasion resistance necessary for the aqsa tow cable luna is collaborating with lockheed martin to develop a hydrophobic water shedding coating that is mechanically durable optically transparent and easy to apply and while revenue stemming from research and development accounts for  of lunas revenue the team understands the importance of bringing a product to market if you look at some of the largest research entities in the country over history those companies are a shell of what they used to be because it is extremely expensive to perform just research you have to learn to commercialize explains chung that is why the sbir program is critical the government has stepped in and provided funding for pure research it allows us to afford a research team we will continue to leverage that it is great source of future products and technologies in summary luna innovations provides unique capabilities and instrumentation for the telecommunications industry and for distributed fiber optic sensing lunas products divisions currently account for the majority of their revenue but the technology division is leveraging the sbir program to build and maintain a strong portfolio of diverse
