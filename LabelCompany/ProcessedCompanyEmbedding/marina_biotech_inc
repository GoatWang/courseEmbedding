designation ftd from the united states food and drug administration fda and preclinical programs for the treatment of type  myotonic dystrophy dm and duchenne muscular dystrophy dmdthe company creates a range of therapeutics targeting coding and noncoding ribonucleic acid rna through several mechanisms of action such as rna interference rnai messenger rna translational inhibition exon skipping microrna mirna replacement mirna inhibition and steric blocking in order to modulate gene expression either up or down depending on the specific mechanism of action the company uses its drug discovery platform to discover and develop multiple nucleic acidbased therapeutics including small interfering rna sirna mirna mimics and single stranded oligonucleotidebased compoundsthe company has over two liposomalbased delivery platforms the first platform smarticles defines a class of liposomes that are chargereversible particles allowing delivery of active substance sirna singlestranded oligonucleotides inside a cell either by local or systemic administration the second platform utilizes aminobased liposomal delivery technology and incorporates a molecule dialkylated amino acid dila its transkingdom rna interference tkrnai platform involves the modification of bacteria to deliver shorthairpin rna shrna to cells of the gastrointestinal tractthe company is developing ceq for the treatment of fap a hereditary condition fap is caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene as a result of these mutations epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract have increased levels of the protein betacatenin which in turn results in uncontrolled cell growth ceq utilizes the tkrnai platform it is an orally administered rnaibased therapeutic in clinical development ceq consists of attenuated bacteria that are engineered to enter into dysplastic tissue and release a payload of shrna a mediator in the rnai pathway the company is developing ceq to reduce the levels of betacatenin protein in the epithelial cells of the small and large intestine upon enrollment in the phase ibiia clinical trial patients are placed in one of four doseescalating cohorts the company

tweet link email print diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the

innovative research and technological breakthroughs of americas biopharmaceutical industry and get to know the people behind the fight to prevent treat and cure disease our fight our mission our companies follow us  pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america  f street nw suite  washington dc   p   f phrmaorg innovationorg privacy policy terms of service aboutus finding lifesaving medicines is a lifes work – the work of  researchers who never say never as well as the millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life against whatever odds they face together now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor the best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and its coming faster than we can imagine welcome to the future of medicine where disease is no match for tenacity no match for ingenuity where together we go boldly do not go gentle todays breakthroughs are becoming tomorrows medicines watch the video we cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news mustknow facts about drug costs did you know due to negotiation and competition medicine costs are growing at the slowest rate in years  learn the facts do not go gentle welcome to the future of

these have the potential of replacing opioids and combating the opioid epidemic problems edema pain and opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths and opioidinvolved deaths continue to increase in the
