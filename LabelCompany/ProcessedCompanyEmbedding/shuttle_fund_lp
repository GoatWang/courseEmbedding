investment oportunity exists to capitalize on the disruption digitization and disintermediation of centralized services in relation to the size of the opportunity and the rapid growth rates associated with uptake of disruptive technologies digital beta will target annualized returns in excess of  per year “blockchains will change everything” goldman sachs the fund will be partially activist to ensure growth and adoption of investments  longer holding periods will allow access to emergent but currently illiquid investments that provide asymmetric risk return profiles  fundamental analysis

gold” and as a payment network that is enabling a global open permissionless financial system… over the past  years alone the united states dollar has lost  percent of its value the british pound has lost  percent the euro has lost  percent and the australian dollar has lost  percent shuttle fund is designed for short term capital appreciation via asset allocation ahead of major inflows and is structured like a positive carry cds on soverign debt “blockchains are the biggest innovation since the internet itself” marc andreesen opportunity digital β fund strategy includes eclectic investments into meta and digital assets with a fundamental bias the investment thesis includes front running capital allocation into an emergent asset class that provides a unique hedge against systematic macroeconomic risk this risk is severely mispriced due to experimental and direct monetary policy intervention the fund portfolio will be constructed to serve as a cheap call option against a global financial meltdown and should be included in a well diversified portfolio in the event of a loss of confidence in central banks and national currencies this portfolio should significantly outperform the fund also looks to profit on emergent trend of digitization in areas of capital formation exchange and governance with the gradual progression of society from physical to digital worlds
