objective is longterm growth of capital the fund pursues this objective by investing in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of the equity and equityrelated securities of companies that are organized and have principal offices in foreign countries foreign companies and depositary receipts for securities of such companies there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its objective under normal circumstances at least  of the funds total assets are invested in equity securities consisting of common stock and securities with common stock characteristics such as preferred stock warrants and debt securities convertible into common stock and american depositary receipts for such securities equity securities pioneering management corporation the manager currently intends to focus on securities of issuers located in such countries as australia canada hong kong japan malaysia mexico new zealand singapore the united kingdom and the other developed countries of western europe as well as the countries with emerging markets listed in investments in emerging markets the fund may also invest up to  of its total assets in other eligible investments as defined below consisting of money market and fixedincome securities and may employ certain other active management techniques certain of these techniques may be used in an attempt to hedge foreign currency and other risks associated with the funds investments these techniques include purchasing options on securities indices entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts purchasing options on foreign currencies entering into futures contracts on securities indices and currencies purchasing and selling options on such futures contracts and lending portfolio securities the fund may also enter into repurchase agreements and invest in restricted and illiquid securities see the appendix to this prospectus and the statement of additional information for a description of these investment practices and securities and associated risks as to any specific investment in equity securities the managers analysis will focus on evaluating the fundamental value of an enterprise the fund will purchase securities for its portfolio when their market price appears to be less than their fundamental value in the judgment of the manager in selecting specific investments the manager will attempt to identify securities with strong potential for appreciation relative to their downside exposure in this regard the manager will also use a macroanalysis of numerous economic and valuation variables to determine the anticipated investment climate in specific countries in making these determinations the manager will take into account priceearnings ratios cash flow the relationship of asset value to market price of the securities and other factors which it may determine from time to time to be relevant because current income is not the funds investment objective the fund will not restrict its investments in equity securities to those of issuers with a record of timely dividend payments while investing in foreign equity securities involves certain risks as discussed below the manager believes such investments offer opportunities for capital growth and diversification today more than twothirds of the worlds stock market value is traded on markets outside the united states investing overseas can help diversify a portfolio otherwise invested solely in us securities foreign stock and bond markets often do not parallel the performance of us markets which means that over time diversifying investments across several countries can help reduce portfolio volatility under normal circumstances at least  of the funds total assets will be invested in securities of companies domiciled in at least three different foreign countries risk factors investing in the securities of foreign companies and foreign governments involves certain considerations and risks which are not typically associated with investing in securities of domestic companies and the united states government in many foreign countries issuers are not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial standards and requirements comparable to those applicable to united states companies also in many foreign countries there is less government supervision and regulation of foreign securities exchanges brokers and listed companies than exists in the united states interest and dividends paid by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes which will decrease the net return on such investments as compared to interest and dividends paid to a fund by domestic companies or by the us government in addition the value of foreign securities may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in the relative rates of exchange between the currencies of different nations and by exchange control regulations the funds investment performance may be significantly affected either positively or negatively by currency exchange rates because the us dollar value of securities denominated in a foreign currency will increase or decrease in response to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar there may also be less publicly available information about foreign companies compared to reports and ratings published about us companies some foreign securities markets generally have substantially less trading volume than domestic markets and securities of some foreign companies are less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable us companies brokerage commissions in foreign countries are generally fixed and other transaction costs related to securities exchanges are generally higher than in the united states most foreign equity securities of the fund are held by foreign subcustodians that satisfy certain eligibility requirements however foreign subcustodian arrangements are significantly more expensive than domestic custody in addition foreign settlement of securities transactions is subject to local law and custom that is not generally as well established or as reliable as us regulation and custom applicable to settlements of securities transactions and accordingly there is generally perceived to be a greater risk of loss in connection with securities transactions in many foreign countries additionally in some foreign countries there is the possibility of expropriation nationalization or confiscation of assets and property limitations on the removal of securities property or other assets of the fund political or social instability or diplo pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th matic developments which could affect us investments in those countries the manager will take these factors into consideration in managing the funds investments investment in japan and the united kingdom the fund may invest more than  of its total assets in the securities of corporate issuers located in each of japan and the united kingdom and more than  of the funds total assets adjusted to reflect currency transactions and positions may be denominated in the japanese yen and the british pound investment of a substantial portion of the funds assets in such countries or currencies will subject the fund to the risks of adverse securities markets exchange rates and social political or economic events which may occur in those countries investments in emerging markets the fund may invest without limitation in securities of issuers located in countries with emerging economies or securities markets but will not invest more than  of its total assets in securities of issuers located in any one such country countries with emerging economies or securities markets include argentina bangladesh brazil chile china colombia czech republic egypt greece hungary india indonesia israel jamaica jordan kenya south korea kuwait morocco nigeria pakistan peru the philippines poland south africa sri lanka taiwan thailand turkey venezuela and zimbabwe political and economic structures in many of such countries may be undergoing significant evolution and rapid development and such countries may lack the social political and economic stability characteristic of more developed countries as a result the risks described above relating to investments in foreign securities including the risks of nationalization or expropriation of assets may be heightened in addition unanticipated political or social developments may affect the values of the funds investments and the availability to the fund of additional investments in such countries the small size and inexperience of the securities markets in certain of such countries and the limited volume of trading in securities in those countries may make the funds investments in such countries less liquid and more volatile than investments in countries with more developed securities markets such as japan or most western european countries investments in depositary receipts the fund may hold securities of foreign issuers in the form of american depositary receipts adrs global depositary receipts gdrs and other similar instruments or other securities convertible into securities of eligible issuers generally adrs in registered form are designed for use in us securities markets and gdrs and other similar global instruments in bearer form are designed for use in nonus securities markets adrs are denominated in us dollars and represent an interest in the right to receive securities of foreign issuers deposited in a us bank or correspondent bank adrs do not eliminate all the risk inherent in investing in the securities of nonus issuers however by investing in adrs rather than directly in equity securities of nonus issuers the fund will avoid currency risks during the settlement period for either purchases or sales gdrs are not necessarily denominated in the same currency as the underlying securities which they represent for purposes of the funds investment policies investments in adrs gdrs and similar instruments will be deemed to be investments in the underlying equity securities of the foreign issuers the fund may acquire depositary receipts from banks that do not have a contractual relationship with the issuer of the security underlying the depositary receipt to issue and secure such depositary receipt to the extent the fund invests in such unsponsored depositary receipts there may be an increased possibility that the fund may not become aware of events affecting the underlying security and thus the value of the related depositary receipt in addition certain benefits ie rights offerings which may be associated with the security underlying the depositary receipt may not inure to the benefit of the holder of such depositary receipt other eligible investments the funds other eligible investments consist of a corporate commercial paper and other shortterm commercial obligations in each case rated or issued by foreign or domestic companies with similar securities outstanding that are rated prime aa or better by moodys investors service inc moodys or a aa or better by standard and poors ratings group standard and poors b obligations including certificates of deposit time deposits demand deposits and bankers acceptances of banks located in the united states or foreign countries with securities outstanding that are rated prime aa or better by moodys or a aa or better by standard and poors c obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government or the government of a foreign country or their respective agencies or instrumentalities d fixedincome securities of foreign or domestic companies which are rated at the time of investment within the top four grades by the major rating services moodys baa or higher standard and poors bbb or higher or if unrated judged to be of comparable quality by the manager and e repurchase agreements these securities may be denominated in us dollars or in foreign currencies in the event that the credit quality of a security falls below investment grade subsequent to purchase the fund may nevertheless retain such security as long as the manager determines it is advisable to do so however at no time may the fund have more than  of its net assets invested in fixedincome securities rated below investment grade securities rated baa or bbb and securities of comparable quality may have speculative characteristics and changes in economic conditions or other circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to make principal and interest payments than is the case with higher grade debt securities the fund may on occasion for temporary defensive purposes to preserve capital invest up to  of its total assets in other eligible investments except that when the fund assumes a defensive posture it will not invest in fixedincome securities of foreign or domestic companies rated below a by moodys or standard  poors or if unrated judged to be of comparable credit quality by the manager the fund will assume a temporary defensive posture only when political and economic factors affect foreign equity markets to such an extent that the manager believes there to be extraordinary risks in being substantially invested in foreign equity securities pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th lending of portfolio securities the fund may also seek to earn additional income by lending its portfolio securities under present regulatory policies such loans may be made to institutions such as certain brokerdealers and are required to be secured continuously by collateral in cash cash equivalents or us government securities maintained on a current basis at an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned if the manager decides to make securities loans the value of the securities loaned would not exceed  of the value of the total assets of the fund see investment policy and restrictions in the statement of additional information the fund may experience a loss or delay in the recovery of its securities if the institution with which it has engaged in a portfolio securities loan transaction breaches its agreement with the fund certain other investment techniques as noted above the fund may purchase put and call options on securities indices purchase put and call options on currencies enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts and enter into futures contracts on indices and currencies and purchase and sell options on such futures contracts these techniques may be employed in an attempt to hedge currency or other risks associated with the funds portfolio securities while the successful use of these techniques may reduce or eliminate certain risks these techniques also involve transaction costs as well as risks these risks include the risk that contractual positions once entered may not be easily closed out on a particular market the risk that the attempted hedge may be ineffective because changes in the value of a hedged position may not correlate to the securities market or currency being hedged and the risk that an incorrect prediction by the manager in the movement of securities prices or exchange rates may cause the fund to perform less well if the hedge had not been attempted see the appendix for a further description of these techniques and associated risks portfolio turnover the manager avoids markettiming or speculating on broad market fluctuations therefore except as described above the fund is substantially fully invested at all times a high rate of portfolio turnover  or more involves correspondingly greater transaction costs which must be borne by the fund and its shareholders and may under certain circumstances make it more difficult for the fund to qualify as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code see dividends distributions and taxation changes in the portfolio may be made promptly when determined to be advisable by reason of developments not foreseen at the time of the initial investment decision and usually without reference to the length of time a security has been held accordingly portfolio turnover rates are not considered a limiting factor in the execution of investment decisions the funds investment objective and certain investment restrictions designated as fundamental in the statement of additional information may be changed by the board of trustees only with shareholder approval iv management of the fund the funds board of

limitations associated with transactions in options futures contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts the fund may employ certain active management techniques including options on securities indices options on currencies futures contracts and options on futures and forward foreign currency exchange contracts each of these active management techniques involves  liquidity risk that contractual positions cannot be easily closed out in the event of market changes or generally in the absence of a liquid secondary market  correlation risk that changes in the value of hedging positions may not match the securities market and foreign currency fluctuations intended to be hedged and  market risk that an incorrect prediction of securities prices or exchange rates by the manager may cause the fund to perform less well than if such positions had not been entered the ability to terminate overthecounter options is more limited than with exchange traded options and may involve the risk that the counterparty to the option will not fulfill its obligations the fund will treat purchased overthe counter options as illiquid securities the uses of options futures and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are highly specialized activities which involve investment techniques and risks that are different from those associated with ordinary portfolio transactions the loss that may be incurred by the fund in entering into futures contracts and written options thereon and forward foreign currency exchange contracts is potentially unlimited except as set forth below under futures contracts and options on futures contracts there is no limit on the percentage of the funds assets that may be invested in futures contracts and related options or forward foreign currency exchange contracts the fund may not invest more than  of its total assets in purchased options other than protective put options the funds transactions in options forward foreign currency exchange contracts futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be limited by the requirements for qualification of the fund as a regulated investment company for tax purposes see tax status in the statement of additional information options on securities indices the fund may purchase put and call options on indices that are based on securities in which it may invest to manage cash flow and to manage its exposure to foreign and domestic stocks or stock markets instead of or in addition to buying and selling stock the fund may also purchase options in order to hedge against risks of marketwide price fluctuations the fund may purchase put options in an attempt to hedge against an anticipated decline in securities prices that might adversely affect the value of the funds portfolio securities if the fund purchases a put option on a securities index the amount of the payment it would receive upon exercising the option would depend on the extent of any decline in the level of the securities index below the exercise price such payments would tend to offset a decline in the value of the funds portfolio securities however if the level of the securities index increases and remains above the exercise price while the put option is outstanding the fund will not be able to exercise the option profitably and will lose the amount of the premium and any transaction costs such loss may be partially offset by an increase in the value of the funds portfolio securities the fund may purchase call options on securities indices in order to remain fully invested in a particular foreign stock market or to lock in a favorable price on securities that it intends to buy in the future if the fund purchases a call option on a securities index the amount of the payment it receives upon exercising the option depends on the extent of an increase in the level of other securities indices above the exercise price such payments would in effect allow the fund to benefit from securities market appreciation even though it may not have had sufficient cash to purchase the underlying securities such payments may also offset increases in the price of securities that the fund intends to purchase if however the level of the securities index declines and remains below the exercise price while the call option is outstanding the fund will not be able to exercise the option profitably and will lose the amount of the premium and transaction costs such loss may be partially offset by a reduction in the price the fund pays to buy additional securities for its portfolio the fund may sell an option it has purchased or a similar option prior to the expiration of the purchased option in order to close out its position in an option which it has purchased the fund may also allow options to expire unexercised which would result in the loss of the premium paid forward foreign currency exchange contracts and options on foreign currencies the fund has the ability to hold a portion of its assets in foreign currencies and to enter into forward foreign currency contracts to facilitate settlement of foreign securities transactions or to protect against changes in foreign currency exchange rates the fund might sell a foreign currency on either a spot or forward basis to seek to hedge against an anticipated decline in the dollar value of securities in its portfolio or securities it intends or has contracted to sell or to preserve the us dollar value of dividends interest or other amounts it expects to receive although this strategy could minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged foreign currency it could also limit any potential gain which might result from an increase in the value of the currency alternatively the fund might purchase a foreign currency or enter into a forward purchase contract for the currency to preserve the us dollar price of securities it is authorized to purchase or has contracted to purchase the fund may also engage in crosshedging by using forward contracts in one currency to hedge against fluctuations in the value of securities denominated in a different currency if the manager determines that there is a pattern of correlation between the two currencies crosshedging may also include entering into a forward transaction involving two foreign currencies using one foreign currency as a proxy for the pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th us dollar to hedge against variations in the other foreign currency if the manager determines that there is a pattern of correlation between the proxy currency and the us dollar if the fund enters into a forward contract to buy foreign currency for any purpose the fund will be required to place cash or liquid high grade securities in a segregated account of the fund maintained by the funds custodian in an amount equal to the value of the funds total assets committed to the consummation of the forward contract the fund may purchase put and call options on foreign cur rencies for the purpose of protecting against declines in the dollar value of foreign portfolio securities and against increases in the us dollar cost of foreign securities to be acquired the fund may also use options on currency to crosshedge the purchase of an option on a foreign currency may constitute an effective hedge against exchange rate fluctuations in addition the fund may purchase call or put options on currency for nonhedging purposes when the manager anticipates that the currency will appreciate or depreciate but the securities denominated in that currency do not present attractive investment opportunities and are not held in the funds portfolio futures contracts and options on futures contracts to hedge against changes in securities prices currency exchange rates or interest rates the fund may purchase and sell various kinds of futures contracts and purchase and write call and put options on any of such futures contracts the fund may also enter into closing purchase and sale transactions with respect to any of such contracts and options the futures contracts may be based on various stock and other securities indices foreign currencies and other financial instruments and indices the fund will engage in futures and related options transactions for bona fide hedging or other nonhedging purposes as are permitted by regulations of the commodity futures trading commission the fund may not purchase or sell nonhedging futures contracts or purchase or sell related nonhedging options except for closing purchase or sale transactions if immediately thereafter the sum of the amount of initial margin deposits on the funds existing nonhedging futures and related nonhedging options positions and the amount of premiums paid for existing nonhedging options on futures net of the amount the positions are in the money would exceed  of the market value of the funds net assets these transactions involve brokerage costs require margin deposits and in the case of contracts and options obligating the fund to purchase currencies require the fund to segregate assets to cover such contracts and options repurchase agreements the fund may enter into repurchase agreements not exceeding seven days in duration in a repurchase agreement an investor eg the fund purchases a debt security from a seller which undertakes to repurchase the security at a specified resale price on an agreed future date ordinarily a week or less the resale price generally exceeds the purchase price by an amount which reflects an agreedupon market interest rate for the term of the repurchase agreement repurchase agreements entered into by the fund will be fully collateralized with us treasury andor us government agency obligations with a market value of not less than  of the obligation valued daily collateral will be held in a segregated safekeeping account for the benefit of the fund in the event that a repurchase agreement is not fulfilled the fund could suffer a loss to the extent that the value of the collateral falls below the repurchase price or if the fund is prevented from realizing the value of the collateral by reason of an order of a court with jurisdiction over an insolvency proceeding with respect to the other party to the repurchase agreement restricted and illiquid securities the fund may invest in restricted securities ie securities that would be required to be registered prior to distribution to the public including restricted securities eligible for resale to certain institutional investors pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  in addition the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in restricted securities sold and offered under rule a that are illiquid either as a result of legal or contractual restrictions or the absence of a trading market the board of trustees of the fund has adopted guidelines and delegated to the manager the daily function of determining and monitoring the liquidity of restricted securities the board however retains sufficient oversight and is ultimately responsible for the determinations since it is not possible to predict with assurance exactly how the market for restricted securities sold and offered under rule a will develop the board carefully monitors the funds investments in these securities focusing on such important factors among others as valuation liquidity and availability of information this investment practice could have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity in the fund to the extent that qualified institutional buyers become for a time uninterested in purchasing these restricted securities securities of nonus issuers that the fund acquires in rule a transactions but which the fund may resell publicly in a nonus securities market are not considered restricted securities pbposst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st notes

policies and restrictions the prospectus the prospectus of pioneer international growth fund the fund identifies the investment objective and the principal investment policies of the fund other investment policies of the fund are set forth below capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning given to them in the prospectus securities index options the fund may purchase call and put options on securities indices for the purpose of hedging against the risk of unfavorable price movements adversely affecting the value of the funds securities or securities the fund intends to buy securities index options will not be used for speculative purposes currently options on stock indices are traded only on national securities exchanges and overthecounter both in the united states and in foreign countries a securities index fluctuates with changes in the market values of the securities included in the index for example some stock index options are based on a broad market index such as the sp  or the value line composite index in the us the nikkei in japan or the ftse  in the united kingdom index options may also be based on a narrower market index such as the sp  or on an industry or market segment such as the amex oil and gas index or the computer and business equipment index the fund may purchase put options in order to hedge against an anticipated decline in securities prices that might adversely affect the value of the funds portfolio securities if the fund purchases a put option on a securities index the amount of the payment it would receive upon exercising the option would depend on the extent of any decline in the level of the securities index below the exercise price such payments would tend to offset a decline in the value of the funds portfolio securities however if the level of the securities index increases and remains above the exercise price while the put option is outstanding the fund will not be able to profitably exercise the option and will lose the amount of the premium and any transaction costs such loss may be partially offset by an increase in the value of the funds portfolio securities the fund may purchase call options on securities indices in order to remain fully invested in a particular foreign stock market or to lock in a favorable price on securities that it intends to buy in the future if the fund purchases a call option on a securities index the amount of the payment it receives upon exercising the option depends on the extent of an increase in the level of other securities indices above the

call option is outstanding the fund will not be able to exercise the option profitably and will lose the amount of the premium and transaction costs such loss may be partially offset by a reduction in the price the fund pays to buy additional securities for its portfolio the fund may sell the securities index option it has purchased or write a similar offsetting securities index option in order to close out a position in a securities index option which it has purchased these closing sale transactions enable the fund to immediately realize gains or minimize losses on its options positions however there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an options exchange will exist for any particular option or at any particular time and for some options no secondary market may exist in addition securities index prices may be distorted by interruptions in the trading of securities of certain companies or of issuers in certain industries or by restrictions that may be imposed by an exchange on opening or closing transactions or both which would disrupt trading in options on such indices and preclude the fund from closing out its options positions if the fund is unable to effect a closing sale transaction with respect to options that it has purchased it would have to exercise the options in order to realize any profit the hours of trading for options may not conform to the hours during which the underlying securities are traded to the extent that the options markets close before the markets for the underlying securities significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that can not be reflected in the options markets the purchase of options is a highly b pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th specialized activity which involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions personnel of the funds investment adviser pioneering management corporation pmc have considerable experience in options transactions in addition to the risks of imperfect correlation between the funds portfolio and the index underlying the option the purchase of securities index options involves the risk that the premium and transaction costs paid by the fund in purchasing an option will be lost this could occur as a result of unanticipated movements in prices of the securities comprising the securities index on which the option is based forward foreign currency transactions the foreign currency transactions of the fund may be conducted on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate for purchasing or selling currency prevailing in the foreign exchange market the fund also has authority to deal in forward foreign currency exchange contracts involving currencies of the different countries in which it will invest as a hedge against possible variations in the foreign exchange rate between these currencies and the us dollar this is accomplished through contractual agreements to purchase or sell a specified currency at a specified future date and price set at the time of the contract the funds dealings in forward foreign currency contracts will be limited to hedging either specific transactions or portfolio positions transaction hedging is the purchase or sale of forward foreign currency contracts with respect to specific receivables or payables of the fund accruing in connection with the purchase and sale of its portfolio securities denominated in foreign currencies portfolio hedging is the use of forward foreign currency contracts to offset portfolio security positions denominated or quoted in such foreign currencies there is no guarantee that the fund will be engaged in hedging activities when adverse exchange rate movements occur the fund may not necessarily attempt to hedge all of its foreign portfolio positions and will enter into such transactions only to the extent if any deemed appropriate by pmc the fund will not enter into speculative forward foreign currency contracts if the fund enters into a forward contract to purchase foreign currency its custodian bank will segregate cash or high grade liquid debt securities in a separate account of the fund in an amount equal to the value of the funds total assets committed to the consummation of such forward contract those assets will be valued at market daily and if the value of the assets in the separate account declines additional cash or securities will be placed in the accounts so that the value of the account will equal the amount of the funds commitment with respect to such contracts hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the prices of portfolio securities or prevent losses if the prices of such securities decline such transactions also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of the hedged currency should rise moreover it may not be possible for the fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally anticipated that the fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a price above the devaluation level it anticipates the cost to the fund of engaging in foreign currency transactions varies with such factors as the currency involved the size of the contract the length of the contract period and the market conditions then prevailing since transactions in foreign currency and forward contracts are usually conducted on a principal basis no fees or commissions are involved the fund may close out a forward position in a currency by selling the forward contract or entering into an offsetting forward contract options on foreign currencies the fund may purchase options on foreign currencies for hedging purposes in a manner similar to that of transactions in forward contracts for example a decline in the dollar value of a foreign currency in which portfolio securities are denominated will reduce the dollar value of such securities even if their value in the foreign currency remains constant in order to protect against such decreases in the value of portfolio securities the fund may purchase put options on the foreign currency if the value of the currency declines the fund will have the right to sell such currency for a fixed amount of dollars which exceeds the market value of such currency this would result in a gain that may offset in whole or in part the negative effect of currency depreciation on the value of the funds securities denominated in that currency conversely if a rise in the dollar value of a currency is projected for those securities to be acquired thereby increasing the cost of such securities the fund may purchase call options on such currency if the value of b pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th such currency increased the purchase of such call options would enable the fund to purchase currency for a fixed amount of dollars which is less than the market value of such currency such a purchase would result in a gain that may offset at least partially the effect of any currency related increase in the price of securities the fund intends to acquire as in the case of other types of options transactions however the benefit the fund derives from purchasing foreign currency options will be reduced by the amount of the premium and related transaction costs in addition if currency exchange rates do not move in the direction or to the extent anticipated the fund could sustain losses on transactions in foreign currency options which would deprive it of a portion or all of the benefits of advantageous changes in such rates the fund may close out its position in a currency option by either selling the option it has purchased or entering into an offsetting option futures contracts and options on futures contracts to hedge against changes in securities prices or currency exchange rates the fund may purchase and sell various kinds of futures contracts and purchase and write sell call and put options on any of such futures contracts the fund may also enter into closing purchase and sale transactions with respect to any of such contracts and options the futures contracts may be based on various securities such as us government securities securities indices foreign currencies and other financial instruments and indices the fund will engage in futures and related options transactions for bona fide hedging and nonhedging purposes as described below all futures contracts entered into by the fund are traded on us exchanges or boards of trade that are licensed and regulated by the commodity futures trading commission the cftc or on foreign exchanges futures contracts a futures contract may generally be described as an agreement between two parties to buy and sell particular financial instruments for an agreed price during a designated month or to deliver the final cash settlement price in the case of a contract relating to an index or otherwise not calling for physical delivery at the end of trading in the contract when interest rates are rising or securities prices are falling the fund can seek to offset a decline in the value of its current portfolio securities through the sale of futures contracts when interest rates are falling or securities prices are rising the fund through the purchase of futures contracts can attempt to secure better rates or prices than might later be available in the market when it effects anticipated purchases similarly the fund can sell futures contracts on a specified currency to protect against a decline in the value of such currency and a decline in the value of its portfolio securities which are denominated in such currency the fund can purchase futures contracts on foreign currency to establish the price in us dollars of a security denominated in such currency that the fund has acquired or expects to acquire positions taken in the futures markets are not normally held to maturity but are instead liquidated through offsetting transactions which may result in a profit or a loss while futures contracts on securities or currency will usually be liquidated in this manner the fund may instead make or take delivery of the underlying securities or currency whenever it appears economically advantageous to do so a clearing corporation associated with the exchange on which futures on securities or currency are traded guarantees that if still open the sale or purchase will be performed on the settlement date hedging strategies hedging by use of futures contracts seeks to establish with more certainty the effective price rate of return and currency exchange rate on portfolio securities and securities that the fund owns or proposes to acquire the fund may for example take a short position in the futures market by selling futures contracts in order to hedge against an anticipated rise in interest rates or a decline in market prices or foreign currency rates that would adversely affect the value of the funds portfolio securities such futures contracts may include contracts for the future delivery of securities held by the fund or securities with characteristics similar to those of the funds portfolio securities similarly the fund may sell futures contracts in currency in which its portfolio securities are denominated or in one currency to hedge against fluctuations in the value of securities denominated in a different currency if there is an established historical pattern of correlation between the two currencies if in the opinion of pmc there is a sufficient degree of correlation between price trends for the funds portfolio securities and futures contracts based on other financial instruments securities indices or other indices the fund may also enter into such futures contracts as part of its hedging strategy although under some circumstances prices of securities in the funds portfolio may be more or less volatile than prices of such futures contracts pmc will attempt to estimate the extent of b pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th this volatility difference based on historical patterns and compensate for any such differential by having the fund enter into a greater or lesser number of futures contracts or by attempting to achieve only a partial hedge against price changes affecting the funds securities portfolio when hedging of this character is successful any depreciation in the value of portfolio securities will be substantially offset by appreciation in the value of the futures position on the other hand any unanticipated appreciation in the value of the funds portfolio securities would be substantially offset by a decline in the value of the futures position on other occasions the fund may take a long position by purchasing futures contracts this would be done for example when the fund anticipates the subsequent purchase of particular securities when it has the necessary cash but expects the prices or currency exchange rates then available in the applicable market to be less favorable than prices or rates that are currently available options on futures contracts the acquisition of put and call options on futures contracts will give the fund the right but not the obligation for a specified price to sell or to purchase respectively the underlying futures contract at any time during the option period as the purchaser of an option on a futures contract the fund obtains the benefit of the futures position if prices move in a favorable direction but limits its risk of loss in the event of an unfavorable price movement to the loss of the premium and transaction costs the writing of a call option on a futures contract generates a premium which may partially offset a decline in the value of the funds assets by writing a call option the fund becomes obligated in exchange for the premium to sell a futures contract which may have a value higher than the exercise price conversely the writing of a put option on a futures contract generates a premium which may partially offset an increase in the price of securities that the fund intends to purchase however the fund becomes obligated to purchase a futures contract which may have a value lower than the exercise price thus the loss incurred by the fund in writing options on futures is potentially unlimited and may exceed the amount of the premium received the fund will incur transaction costs in connection with the writing of options on futures the holder or writer of an option on a futures contract may terminate its position by selling or purchasing an offsetting option on the same series there is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected the funds ability to establish and close out positions on such options will be subject to the development and maintenance of a liquid market the fund may use options on futures contracts for bona fide hedging or nonhedging purposes as discussed below other considerations the fund will engage in futures and related options transactions only for bona fide hedging or nonhedging purposes in accordance with cftc regulations which permit principals of an investment company registered under the investment company act of  as amended the  act to engage in such transactions without registering as commodity pool operators the fund is not permitted to engage in speculative futures trading the fund will determine that the price fluctuations in the futures contracts and options on futures used for hedging purposes are substantially related to price fluctuations in securities held by the fund or which it expects to purchase except as stated below the funds futures transactions will be entered into for traditional hedging purposes  ie futures contracts will be sold to protect against a decline in the price of securities or the currency in which they are denominated that the fund owns or futures contracts will be purchased to protect the fund against an increase in the price of securities or the currency in which they are denominated it intends to purchase as evidence of this hedging intent the fund expects that on  or more of the occasions on which it takes a long futures or option position involving the purchase of futures contracts the fund will have purchased or will be in the process of purchasing equivalent amounts of related securities or assets denominated in the related currency in the cash market at the time when the futures or option position is closed out however in particular cases when it is economically advantageous for the fund to do so a long futures position may be terminated or an option may expire without the corresponding purchase of securities or other assets as an alternative to literal compliance with the bona fide hedging definition a cftc regulation permits the fund to elect to comply with a different test under which the sum of the amounts of initial margin deposits on the funds existing nonhedging futures contracts and premiums paid for nonhedging options on futures net of the amount the positions are in the money would exceed  of the market value of the funds total assets the fund will engage in transactions in futures contracts and related options only to the b pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th extent such transactions are consistent with the requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code for maintaining its qualification as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes transaction costs associated with futures contracts and related options involve brokerage costs require margin deposits and in the case of contracts and options obligating the fund to purchase securities or currencies require the fund to segregate assets to cover such contracts and options while transactions in futures contracts and options on futures may reduce certain risks such transactions themselves entail certain other risks thus while the fund may benefit from the use of futures and options on futures unanticipated changes in interest rates securities prices or currency exchange rates may result in a poorer overall performance for the fund than if it had not entered into any futures contracts or options transactions in the event of an imperfect correlation between a futures position and a portfolio position which is intended to be protected the desired protection may not be obtained and the fund may be exposed to risk of loss perfect correlation between the funds futures positions and portfolio positions will be difficult to achieve because no futures contracts based on foreign corporate equity securities are currently available the only futures contracts available to hedge the funds portfolio are various futures on us government securities and foreign currencies futures on a municipal securities index and stock index futures in addition it is not possible to hedge fully or perfectly against the effect of currency fluctuations on the value of foreign securities because currency movements impact the value of different securities in differing degrees restricted securities the fund may invest no more than  of its total assets in restricted securities ie securities that would be required to be registered prior to distribution to the public excluding restricted securities eligible for resale to certain institutional investors pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  or foreign securities which are offered or sold outside the united states provided however that no more than  of the funds total assets may be invested in restricted securities including securities eligible for resale under rule a the board of trustees may adopt guidelines and delegate to the manager the daily function of determining and monitoring the liquidity of restricted securities the board however will retain sufficient oversight and be ultimately responsible for the determinations since it is not possible to predict with assurance exactly how this market for restricted securities sold and offered under rule a will develop the board will carefully monitor the funds investments in these securities focusing on such important factors among others as valuation liquidity and availability of information this investment practice could have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity in the fund to the extent that qualified institutional buyers become for a time uninterested in purchasing these restricted securities repurchase agreements the fund may enter into repurchase agreements with primary dealers in us government securities and member banks of the federal reserve system which furnish collateral at least equal in value or market price to the amount of their repurchase obligation the fund may also enter into repurchase agreements involving certain foreign government securities in a repurchase agreement an investor eg the fund purchases a debt security from a seller which undertakes to repurchase the security at a specified resale price on an agreed future date ordinarily a week or less the resale price generally exceeds the purchase price by an amount which reflects an agreedupon market interest rate for the term of the repurchase agreement the primary risk is that if the seller defaults the fund might suffer a loss to the extent that the proceeds from the sale of the underlying securities and other collateral held by the fund in connection with the related repurchase agreement are less than the repurchase price another risk is that in the event of bankruptcy of the seller the fund could be delayed or prohibited from disposing of the underlying securities and other collateral held by the fund in connection with the related repurchase agreement pending court proceedings in evaluating whether to enter a repurchase agreement the manager will carefully consider the creditworthiness of the seller pursuant to procedures reviewed and approved by the trustees investment restrictions the fund has adopted certain additional investment restrictions which may not be changed without the

security to be purchased or sold the execution efficiency settlement capability and financial condition of the dealer the dealers execution services rendered on a continuing basis and the reasonableness of any dealer spreads most transactions in foreign equity securities are executed by brokerdealers in foreign countries in which commission rates are fixed and therefore are not negotiable as such rates are in the united states and are generally higher than in the united states pmc may select brokerdealers which provide brokerage andor research services to the fund andor other investment companies or accounts managed by pmc such services may include advice concerning the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities the availability of securities or the purchasers or sellers of securities furnishing analyses and reports concerning issuers industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and performance of accounts and effecting securities transactions and performing functions incidental thereto such as clearance and settlement pmc maintains a listing of brokerdealers who provide such services on a regular basis however because many transactions on behalf of the fund and other investment companies or accounts managed by pmc are placed with brokerdealers including brokerdealers on the listing without regard to the furnishing of such services it is not possible to estimate the proportion of such transactions directed to such dealers solely because such services were provided management believes that no exact dollar value can be calculated for such services the research received from brokerdealers may be useful to pmc in rendering investment management services to the fund as well as to other investment companies or accounts managed by pmc although not all of such research may be useful to the fund conversely such information provided by brokers or dealers who have executed transaction orders on behalf of such other accounts may be useful to pmc in carrying out its obligations to the fund the receipt of such research has not reduced pmcs normal independent research activities however it enables pmc to avoid the additional expenses which might otherwise be incurred if it was to attempt to develop comparable information through its own staff in circumstances where two or more brokerdealers offer comparable prices and executions preference may be given to a brokerdealer which has sold shares of the fund as well as shares of other investment companies or accounts managed by pmc this policy does not imply a commitment to execute all portfolio transactions through all brokerdealers that sell shares of the fund in b pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th addition if pmc determines in good faith that the amount of commissions charged by a broker is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such broker the fund may pay commissions to such broker in an amount greater than the amount another firm may charge the trustees periodically review pmcs performance of its responsibilities in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions on behalf of the fund in addition to the fund pmc acts as investment adviser to the other pioneer funds and certain private accounts with investment objectives similar to those of the fund as such securities may meet investment objectives of the fund such other funds and such private accounts in such cases the decision to recommend to purchase for one fund or account rather than another is based on a number of factors the determining factors in most cases are the amount of securities of the issuer then outstanding the value of those securities and the market for them other factors considered in the investment recommendations include other investments which each company presently has in a particular industry or country and the availability of investment funds in each fund or account it is possible that at times identical securities will be held by more than one fund andor account however the position of any fund or account in the same issue may vary and the length of time that any fund or account may choose to hold its investment in the same issue may likewise vary to the extent that the fund another fund in the pioneer group or a private account managed by pmc seeks to acquire the same security at about the same time the fund may not be able to acquire as large a position in such security as it desires or it may have to pay a higher price for the security similarly the fund may not be able to obtain as large an execution of an order to sell or as high a price for any particular portfolio security if pmc decides to sell on behalf of another account the same portfolio security at the same time on the other hand if the same securities are bought or sold at the same time by more than one account the resulting participation in volume transactions could produce better executions for the fund or other account in the event that more than one account purchases or sells the same security on a given date the purchases and sales will normally be made as nearly as practicable on a pro rata basis in proportion to the amounts desired to be purchased or sold by each

the issuance of an unlimited number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest without par value which may be divided into such separate series as the trustees may establish currently the fund consists of only one series the trustees may however establish additional series of shares in the future and may divide or combine the shares into a greater or lesser number of shares without thereby changing the proportionate beneficial interests in the fund the declaration of trust further authorizes the trustees to classify or reclassify any series of the shares into one or more classes pursuant thereto the trustees have authorized the issuance of two classes of shares of the fund class a shares and class b shares each share of a class of the fund represents an equal proportionate interest in the assets of the fund allocable to that class upon liquidation of the fund shareholders of each class of the fund are entitled to share pro rata in the funds net assets allocable to such

as a massachusetts business trust the funds operations are governed by its declaration of trust dated october   a copy of which is on file with the office of the secretary of state of the commonwealth of massachusetts theoretically shareholders of a massachusetts business trust may under certain circumstances be held personally liable for the obligations of the trust however the declaration of trust contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the fund or any series of the fund and provides that notice of such disclaimer may be given in each agreement obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the fund or its trustees moreover the declaration of trust provides for the indemnification out of fund property of any shareholders held personally liable for any obligations of the fund or any series of the fund the declaration of trust also provides that the fund shall upon request assume the defense of any claim made against any shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund and satisfy any judgment thereon thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss beyond his or her investment because of shareholder liability would be limited to circumstances in which the fund itself will be unable to meet its obligations in light of the nature of the funds business and the nature and amount of its assets the possibility of the funds liabilities exceeding its assets and therefore a shareholders risk of personal liability is remote the declaration of trust further provides that the fund shall indemnify each of its trustees and officers against liabilities and expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with or arising out of any action suit or proceeding threatened against or otherwise involving such trustee or officer directly or indirectly by reason of being or having been a trustee or officer of the fund the declaration of trust does not authorize the fund to indemnify any trustee or officer

required to determine its net asset value per share on any day in which no purchase orders for the shares of the fund become effective and no shares are tendered for redemption the net asset value per share of each class of the fund is computed by taking the value of all of the funds assets attributable to a class less the funds liabilities attributable to a class and dividing it by the number of outstanding shares of that class for purposes of determining net asset value expenses of the classes of the fund are accrued daily securities which have not traded on the date of valuation or

investment benchmarks here at home the dow jones industrial average and the standard  poors  index two unmanaged measures of the us stock market gained  and  for the fiscal year respectively rising interest rates changed world financial markets as your funds fiscal year began us interest rates were near their lowest level in  years with shortterm rates around  and longterm rates under  many emerging countries markets experienced an exceptionally prosperous year generating doubledigit and in some cases tripledigit returns for the record number of investors who had moved into these markets in search of highgrowth potential emerging markets had become increasingly attractive compared to mature countries such as the united states and japan which were experiencing sluggish economic growth and historically low interest rates one year later economic growth in most developed nations had picked up and shortterm interest rates in the us had risen to  their highest level in three years the federal reserve began hiking rates in february moving up rates six times during the funds fiscal year higher us rates led to volatility in world financial markets emerging markets in particular suffered from these rate increases investors who had jumped quickly into these markets began exiting just as hastily the result was a huge outflow of money from these countries leading to increased volatility for all international investors several emerging markets within latin america and southeast asia also suffered further declines in their markets as a result of heightened economic and political instabilities in europe investors generally saw market conditions improve over the year with much of the continent moving out of recession not only did the region see economic growth it also benefited from investors who had been in the more volatile emerging markets taking solace in more established markets japan despite being in the midst of a political transformation and suffering from periods of market declines maintained a competitive market position particularly during the first half of the funds fiscal year japans recent strength is reflected by the higher value of the yen versus the us dollar japanese consumers particularly benefited from the stronger yen enabling them to purchase us products more cheaply pbposnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd how pioneer managed your fund as we pursue pioneer international growth funds objective of longterm capital growth we try to find the best opportunities possible  wherever they may be this is why we diversify into both established and emerging markets while one area may be experiencing stagnant growth another may be moving out of recession of course certain risks such as currency fluctuations as well as economic and political instabilities remain an unavoidable part of international investing no matter what the foreign market nonetheless we feel the tradeoff of such risks is worthwhile especially given the superior longterm gains we believe are possible sweden continues to hold our interest and remained the funds most substantial country weighting in europe  on november   with several of the funds largest holdings swedens multinational companies are benefiting from increased exports and global growth and are selling at relatively low prices compared to the rest of europe examples include astra a drug company and volvo an automotive producer finland also has shown potential experiencing a cyclical recovery that has created some good values we are impressed here by nokia a manufacturer of cellular hand sets the company already has benefited from strong global demand for its product line and it continues to be a lowcost competitor on the other hand we have minimized investments in the united kingdom to just  of the portfolio at the funds fiscal year end while the region continues to enjoy low interest rates and inflation many companies there already have experienced higher earnings as a result of the improved economic environment for this reason we have not come across many undervalued uk investments instead we have found more opportunities in other areas of europe  the previously mentioned countries as well as france and germany  whose economic recovery is not as far along as in the united kingdom we expect these nations to follow the united kingdoms lead in terms of economic growth and that companies within these areas too will experience positive movement one company we are especially attracted to is sap a german software firm in emerging markets we began to reduce the funds holdings in latin america and southeast asia although the portfolio continued to have significant exposure to these regions well into the fiscal year as a result the quick and sharp downturns that occurred in some of these markets worked against the fund  just as their previous growth had worked to the funds advantage two areas we continue to favor however are korea and taiwan while these markets also suffered as us interest rates rose they benefited from ongoing investment and support by local investors which meant that liquidity was less of a factor than in other emerging areas in addition korean and taiwanese exporters gained significantly in competitiveness versus their japanese counterparts during  and  since their currencies moved in line with the dollar in korea we expect that the growing need for asian infrastructure development will benefit the steel industry and so we added posco a steel producer to the portfolio another strong area for investment is the communications industry we took a position in korea mobile telecom a cellular phone company in taiwan we consider tuntex a textile manufacturer to be an attractive addition to the funds portfolio holdings in korea and taiwan made up  and  of the portfolio at the end of the period respectively of course these weightings will vary over time as global valuations and our investment outlook inevitably shift as the year progressed we began to take a more defensive position because of the significant volatility and liquidity in emerging markets we opted to hold a higher amount of cash as well as add to securities in established markets such as japan in fact we increased the funds weighting in japanese holdings to  on november  up from  one year earlier we think the countrys improved market strength makes it a more appealing choice than many lesserdeveloped markets and we are looking to further augment portfolio holdings there of course we also recognize the volatility that exists within the japanese market which is why we kept the majority of the funds japanese holdings hedged against currency fluctuations through the periods end the accompanying chart summarizes the funds geographical distribution as of november   pbposrd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd tabular representation of bar chart geographical distribution as of november   united kingdom  netherlands  italy  sigaporemalaysia  argentina  spain  switzerland  switzerland  sweden  finland  germany  phillippines  mexico  denmark  thailand  australia  korea  taiwan  hong kong  indonesia  france  columbia  japan  india  looking ahead near term we expect concerns over additional us interest rate increases to affect financial markets worldwide emerging markets in particular may continue to be volatile because fewer investors turn to lesserdeveloped regions in times of uncertainty in this case over us interest rates market liquidity could be an issue therefore we expect to limit the funds exposure to southeast asia and latin america in the near future and increase its exposure to japan and europe especially since further us interest rate increases cannot be ruled out of course once us interest rates stabilize we think investors again will seek opportunities in emerging regions especially since stocks in many of these markets will have become extremely cheap after significant price declines in  we expect many good values to emerge in areas such as hong kong india and mexico and so our longerterm plans include moving back into these areas while we will remain mindful of volatility and liquidity we are nonetheless optimistic about the many values that exist around the world we remain committed to identifying the regions sectors and individual companies we believe can offer value to

waiver and expense reimbursement – – –  net expenses      the fund’s investment adviser has contractually agreed to limit ordinary operating expenses ordinary operating expenses means all fund expenses other than extraordinary expenses such as litigation taxes brokerage commissions and acquired fund fees and expenses to the extent required to reduce fund expenses to   and  of the average daily net assets attributable to class a class b and class c shares respectively these expense limitations are in effect through april   there can be no assurance that the adviser will extend the expense limitations beyond such time net expenses for a class may exceed the applicable expense limitation to the extent that the fund incurs excluded expenses while in effect the arrangement may be terminated for a class only by agreement of the adviser and the board of trustees  example this example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds the example assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods shown and then except as indicated redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods it also assumes that a your investment has a  return each year and b the funds total annual operating expenses remain the same except for year one which considers the effect of the expense limitation although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be   if you redeem your shares   if you do not redeem your shares   number of years you own your shares             class a           class b           class c           class y           portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or “turns over” its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance during the most recent fiscal year the funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies normally the fund invests at least  of its total assets in equity securities of nonus issuers these issuers may be located in both developed and emerging markets under normal circumstances the funds assets will be invested in securities of companies domiciled in at least three different foreign countries generally the funds investments in any country are limited to  or less of its total assets however from time to time the fund may invest more than  of its assets in issuers organized in japan or the united kingdom or in securities quoted or denominated in the japanese yen the british pound and the euro  summary prospectus the fund may invest without limitation in securities of issuers located in countries with emerging economies or securities markets but will not invest more than  of its total assets in securities of issuers located in any one such country emerging economies or securities markets generally will include but not be limited to countries included in the morgan stanley capital international msci emerging  frontier markets index for purposes of the funds investment policies equity securities include common stocks and other equity instruments such as exchangetraded funds etfs that invest primarily in equity securities depositary receipts equity interests in real estate investment trusts reits warrants rights and preferred shares the fund may invest in initial public offerings of equity securities the fund may also purchase and sell forward foreign currency exchange contracts in nonus currencies in connection with its investments including as a means of managing relative currency exposure the fund may invest up to  of its total assets in debt securities of us and nonus issuers the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in below investment grade debt securities known as “junk bonds” including below investment grade convertible debt securities and securities of issuers that are in default the fund may but is not required to use derivatives the fund may use derivatives including forward foreign currency exchange contracts for a variety of purposes including in an attempt to hedge against adverse changes in the market prices of securities interest rates or currency exchange rates as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities to attempt to increase the fund’s return as a nonhedging strategy that may be considered speculative and to manage portfolio characteristics the fund may choose not to make use of derivatives for a variety of reasons and any use may be limited by applicable law and regulations the fund also may hold cash or other shortterm instruments the funds investment adviser uses a value approach to select the funds investments the adviser seeks to identify securities that are selling at reasonable prices or substantial discounts to their underlying values the adviser evaluates a securitys potential value including the attractiveness of its market valuation based on the companys assets and prospects for earnings and revenue growth employing a bottomup analytical style in making that assessment the adviser employs fundamental research and  an evaluation of the issuer based on its financial statements and operations the adviser focuses on the quality and price of individual issuers and securities the adviser generally sells a portfolio security when it believes that the security’s market value reflects its intrinsic value the adviser makes that determination based upon the same criteria it uses to select portfolio securities principal risks of investing in the fund you could lose money on your investment in the fund as with any mutual fund there is no guarantee that the fund will achieve its objective market risk the values of securities held by the fund may go up or down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably due to general market conditions such as real or perceived adverse economic political or regulatory conditions inflation changes in interest or currency rates lack of liquidity in the bond markets or adverse investor sentiment adverse market conditions may be prolonged and may not have the same impact on all types of securities the values of securities may fall due to factors affecting a particular issuer industry or the securities market as a whole the stock market may perform poorly relative to other investments this risk may be greater in the short term high public debt in the us and other countries creates ongoing and systemic market risks and policymaking uncertainty the financial crisis that began in  has caused a significant decline in the value and liquidity of many securities worldwide governmental and nongovernmental issuers have defaulted on or been forced to restructure their debts and many other issuers have faced difficulties obtaining credit these market conditions may continue worsen or spread including in the us europe and beyond further defaults or restructurings by governments and others of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies financial markets and asset valuations around the world in response to the crisis the us and other governments and the federal reserve and certain foreign central banks have taken steps to support financial markets including by keeping interest rates at historically low levels more recently the federal reserve has reduced its market support activities further reduction or withdrawal of this support failure of efforts in response to the crisis or investor perception that these efforts are not succeeding could negatively affect financial markets generally as well as increase market volatility and reduce the value and liquidity of certain securities whether or not the fund invests in securities of issuers located  summary prospectus in or with significant exposure to countries experiencing economic and financial difficulties the value and liquidity of the fund’s investments may be negatively affected in addition policy and legislative changes in the us and in other countries are affecting many aspects of financial regulation the impact of these changes on the markets and the practical implications for market participants may not be fully known for some time the fund may experience a substantial or complete loss on any individual security or derivative position risks of nonus investments investing in nonus issuers or in us issuers that have significant exposure to foreign markets may involve unique risks compared to investing in securities of us issuers these risks are more pronounced for issuers in emerging markets or to the extent that the fund invests significantly in one region or country these risks may include different financial reporting practices and regulatory standards less liquid trading markets extreme price volatility currency risks changes in economic political regulatory and social conditions sustained economic downturns financial instability tax burdens and investment and repatriation restrictions lack of information and less market regulation also may affect the value of these securities withholding and other nonus taxes may decrease the fund’s return nonus issuers may be located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters investing in depositary receipts is subject to many of the same risks as investing directly in nonus issuers depositary receipts may involve higher expenses and may trade at a discount or premium to the underlying security geographic focus risk to the extent that the fund invests from time to time more than  of its assets in issuers organized or located in a particular geographic region including but not limited to issuers organized or located in japan or the united kingdom or in securities quoted or denominated in the japanese yen the british pound and the euro the fund may be particularly affected by adverse securities markets exchange rates and social political regulatory or economic events which may occur in those countries or regions currency risk because the fund may invest in nonus currencies securities denominated in nonus currencies and other currencyrelated investments the fund is subject to currency risk meaning that the fund could experience losses based on changes in the exchange rate between nonus currencies and the us dollar or as a result of currency  conversion costs currency exchange rates can be volatile and are affected by factors such as general economic conditions the actions of the us and foreign governments or central banks the imposition of currency controls and speculation forward foreign currency transactions risk to the extent that the fund enters into forward foreign currency transactions it may not fully benefit from or may lose money on the transactions if changes in currency rates do not occur as anticipated or do not correspond accurately to changes in the value of the funds holdings or if the counterparty defaults such transactions may also prevent the fund from realizing profits on favorable movements in exchange rates risk of counterparty default is greater for counterparties located in emerging markets the funds ability to use forward foreign currency transactions successfully depends on a number of factors including the forward foreign currency transactions being available at prices that are not too costly the availability of liquid markets and the adviser’s judgment regarding the direction of changes in currency exchange rates value style risk the prices of securities the adviser believes are undervalued may not appreciate as expected or may go down value stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform the overall equity market portfolio selection risk the advisers judgment about a particular security or issuer or about the economy or a particular sector region or market segment or about an investment strategy may prove to be incorrect small and midsize companies risk compared to large companies small and midsize companies and the market for their equity securities may be more sensitive to changes in earnings results and investor expectations have more limited product lines and capital resources experience sharper swings in market values have limited liquidity be harder to value or to sell at the times and prices the adviser thinks appropriate and offer greater potential for gain and loss risks of investments in reits investments in real estate securities are affected by economic conditions interest rates governmental actions and other factors in addition investing in reits involves unique risks they are significantly affected by the market for real estate and are dependent upon management skills and cash flow reits may have lower trading volumes  summary prospectus and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than the overall securities markets mortgage reits are particularly subject to interest rate and credit risks in addition to its own expenses the fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management and other expenses paid by reits in which it invests many real estate companies including reits utilize leverage risks of warrants and rights if the price of the underlying stock does not rise above the exercise price before the warrant expires the warrant generally expires without any value and the fund loses any amount it paid for the warrant the failure to exercise subscription rights to purchase common shares would result in the dilution of the fund’s interest in the issuing company preferred stocks risk preferred stocks may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return preferred stocks are subject to issuerspecific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities in addition a company’s preferred stocks generally pay dividends only after the company makes required payments to holders of its bonds and other debt thus the value of preferred stocks will usually react more strongly than bonds and other debt to actual or perceived changes in the company’s financial condition or prospects the market value of preferred stocks generally decreases when interest rates rise preferred stocks of smaller companies may be more vulnerable to adverse developments than preferred stocks of larger companies risks of convertible securities the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline a downturn in equity markets may cause the price of convertible securities to decrease relative to other fixed income securities debt securities risk factors that could contribute to a decline in the market value of debt securities in the fund include rising interest rates if the issuer or other obligor of a security held by the fund fails to pay principal andor interest otherwise defaults or has its credit rating downgraded or is perceived to be less creditworthy or the credit quality or value of any underlying assets declines junk bonds involve greater risk of loss are subject to greater price volatility and are less liquid especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change than higher quality debt  securities they may also be more difficult to value junk bonds have a higher risk of default or are already in default and are considered speculative market segment risk to the extent the fund emphasizes from time to time investments in a market segment the fund will be subject to a greater degree to the risks particular to that segment and may experience greater market fluctuation than a fund without the same focus derivatives risk using stock index futures and options and other derivatives can increase fund losses and reduce opportunities for gains when market prices interest rates or the derivative instruments themselves behave in a way not anticipated by the fund using derivatives may increase the volatility of the funds net asset value and may not provide the result intended derivatives may have a leveraging effect on the fund some derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss regardless of the size of the fund’s initial investment changes in a derivative’s value may not correlate well with the referenced asset or metric the fund also may have to sell assets at inopportune times to satisfy its obligations derivatives may be difficult to sell unwind or value and the counterparty may default on its obligations to the fund new regulations are changing the derivatives markets the regulations may make using derivatives more costly may limit their availability or may otherwise adversely affect their value or performance for derivatives that are required to be traded through a clearinghouse or exchange the fund also will be exposed to the credit risk of the clearinghouse and the broker that submits trades for the fund it is possible that certain derivatives that are required to be cleared such as certain swap contracts will not be accepted for clearing in addition regulated trading facilities for swap contracts are relatively new they may not function as intended which could impair the ability to enter into swap contracts the extent and impact of the new regulations are not yet fully known and may not be for some time risks of initial public offerings companies involved in initial public offerings ipos generally have limited operating histories and prospects for future profitability are uncertain information about the companies may be available for very limited periods the market for ipo issuers has been volatile and share prices of newly public companies have fluctuated significantly over short periods of time further stocks of newlypublic  summary prospectus companies may decline shortly after the ipo there is no assurance that the fund will have access to ipos the purchase of ipo shares may involve high transaction costs portfolio turnover risk if the fund does a lot of trading it may incur additional operating expenses which would reduce performance a higher level of portfolio turnover may also cause shareholders to incur a higher level of taxable income or capital gains leveraging risk the value of your investment may be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if the fund borrows or uses derivatives or other investments such as etfs that have embedded leverage leverage generally magnifies the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the funds underlying assets or creates investment risk with respect to a larger pool of assets than the fund would otherwise have potentially resulting in the loss of all assets engaging in such transactions may cause the fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or meet segregation requirements risks of investment in other funds investing in other investment companies including exchangetraded funds etfs subjects the fund to the risks of investing in the underlying securities or assets held by those funds when investing in another fund the fund will bear a pro rata portion of the underlying fund’s expenses in addition to its own expenses expense risk your actual costs of investing in the fund may be higher than the expenses shown in “annual fund operating expenses” for a variety of reasons for example expense ratios may be higher than those shown if overall net assets decrease net assets are more likely to decrease and fund expense ratios are more likely to increase when markets are volatile please note that there are many other factors that could adversely affect your investment and that could prevent the fund from achieving its goals an investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit

muchimproved climate for international investors particularly for those in emerging markets while some of the more established regions namely japan and the united kingdom remained stagnant overall results were good how your fund performed for the six months ended may   pioneer international growth fund posted the following results bullet class a shares  net asset value was  per share on may

pioneers approach to international growth opportunities pioneer international growth fund pursues wellvalued companies in established and emerging markets outside the united states we focus on attributes such as company operations cash flows and management we also evaluate economic and government conditions that could affect companies and their longterm growth prospects our opportunistic approach helps keep the portfolio well diversified offering a mix of established and developing markets we remain confident that by identifying promising individual companies and countries we can achieve the best results for the fund over the long term reflects deduction of the maximum  sales charge at the beginning of the period and assumes reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value reflects deduction of the maximum applicable contingent deferred sales charge cdsc at the end of the period and assumes reinvestment of all distributions the maximum cdsc is  and declines over six years past performance does not guarantee future results return and share price fluctuate and your shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost

south africa  hong kong  spain  india  sweden  indonesia  taiwan  italy  thailand  united kingdom   just as your management considers where opportunities exist we also keep in mind investing risks including currency fluctuations and economic and political instabilities for example your management selectively uses conservative hedging techniques as of may   of the portfolios currency exposure was offset by hedges mostly we hedged against a fall in the japanese yen when we expected it would weaken versus the us dollar which it did as the period progressed the hedges in place over the six months slightly enhanced the funds return of course your management does not view hedging as a strategy for augmenting the funds results we believe hedges should be used for defensive purposes only instead we try to achieve strong performance by researching individual companies and countries thats one reason why we tend to choose companies with a healthy export business when the dollar is strong these firms can price their export goods more competitively and profitably in addition we like countries that exhibit a low correlation to us interest rates such as taiwan korea and indonesia emerging markets on the rebound as weve stated before we believe developing markets offer some of the worlds best longterm investment prospects we saw this potential during the sixmonth period particularly in  and specifically in southeast asian countries such as korea thailand taiwan and indonesia in addition to generally low interest rates and inflation each of these countries offers intriguing opportunities for investors for example the political uncertainty stemming from koreas april elections started to subside late in the period we think its stock market offers excellent value especially since it lagged other emerging markets over the past year the funds largest position is in korea mobile telecommunication a cellular phone company which has increased in price impressively in  and in our view still remains well valued we also expect solid results from korean banks namely commercial bank of korea and korea first bank taiwan is another region we think offers excellent potential despite nearterm political tensions your management likes siliconware precision industries an integratedcircuit packaging company elsewhere in southeast asia your management favors thailand and indonesia where markets started to bounce back considerably in early  thanks to renewed investor interest india part of the asian subcontinent has played an increasingly important role in your fund the indian market continued to trade at low prices while offering earnings estimated to grow at  in fiscal year  after the national elections political concerns should subside which we think will help interest rates come down and foreign investment pick up we continue to maintain a position in hong kong an area that has not experienced the dramatic growth of india but nonetheless performed solidly in the six months  pndth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th in latin america some modest economic improvements were visible particularly in argentina your fund holds some good values there specifically we like telecom argentina nonetheless problems did persist throughout most of the region in brazil for example budget and election difficulties continued to hold down markets your management kept minimal exposure to latin america since we see similar growth potential with less risk in emerging asian markets economic growth slowly building in europe the environment for investing in europe was mixed while low inflation and slow economic growth sent interest rates lower across much of the continent we believed many stocks were too expensive as a result we kept a fairly low weighting in many european markets notable exceptions were italy france and sweden italy and france are trading below their historical pricetobook values indicating some inexpensively priced prospects in italy we especially like olivetti and telecom italia an information services firm and telecommunications company respectively chargeurs frances diversified conglomerate also continues to intrigue us despite a temporary downturn stemming from concerns regarding government regulation of its associate british sky broadcasting in sweden the markets low prospective pricetoearnings ratio coupled with earnings per share growth of  reflects its growth potential sweden also offers many world class multinational companies in a variety of industries such as the telecommunications firm telefonaktiebolaget lm ericcson japans troubles continued japan as a whole continued to experience problems despite historically low interest rates the countrys financial markets did not appreciate to any major extent over the period while the weaker yen did help some japanese exporters other troubles namely the continued banking crisis caused many investors to look elsewhere the potential for higher interest rates also triggered concerns your funds investments in japan stood at  at may  while we expect to limit exposure to japan until we see better valuations our research did turn up some good values as mentioned we chose companies that have proven to be strong exporters such as toyota canon sony nintendo and hitachi looking ahead emerging markets are already benefiting from attractive valuations and economic and governmental initiatives designed to enhance competitiveness these markets should continue to offer opportunities since inflation and interest rates generally remain under control and in our view many companies are still trading at extremely low price levels even developed markets while not as strong as a group offer select values with strong potential gains recent results demonstrate the benefit of diversifying internationally  and the need to remain invested clearly shortterm setbacks and volatility will continue as they do in the united states but rather than jump in and out of international markets investors should take a longerterm outlook since the underperformance of one market often is offset by strong performance in another and volatility has much less of an impact on an investment over longer time periods international investing also demonstrates the benefits of professional management by investing in pioneer international growth fund you have access to emerging and established countries that are difficult if not impossible for individuals to participate in on their own we expect the funds assortment of developing and established companies and countries will offer longterm investors solid results the following pages contain your funds audited schedule of investments and financial statements as of may   if you have any questions about
