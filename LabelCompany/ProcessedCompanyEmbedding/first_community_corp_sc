believe that the expectations reflected in our forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot guarantee you that these expectations will be achieved we undertake no obligation to publicly update or otherwise revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise overview the following discussion describes our results of operations for the nine months and three months ended september   as compared to the nine month and three month periods ended september   and also analyzes our financial condition as of september   as compared to december   like most community banks we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits on which we pay interest consequently one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income or the difference between the income on our interestearning assets such as loans and investments and the expense on our interestbearing liabilities such as deposits another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interestearning assets and the rate we pay on our interestbearing liabilities there are risks inherent in all loans so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings in the following section we have included a discussion of this process as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses and the allocation of this allowance among our various categories of loans in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers we describe the various components of this noninterest income as well as our noninterest expense in the following discussion the following discussion and analysis identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report critical accounting policies we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements our significant accounting policies are described in the footnotes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of september   and our notes included in the consolidated financial statements in our  annual report on form k as filed with the sec certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities we consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies the judgment and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions we make actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations allowance for loan losses we believe the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgment and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements some of the more critical judgments supporting the amount of our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit worthiness of borrowers the estimated value of the underlying collateral the assumptions about cash flow determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses the impact of current events and conditions and other factors impacting the level of probable inherent losses under different conditions or using different assumptions the actual amount of credit losses incurred by us may be different from managements estimates provided in our consolidated financial statements refer to the portion of this discussion that addresses our allowance for loan losses for a more complete discussion of our processes and methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value qualitative factors are assessed to first determine if it is more likely than not more than  that the carrying value of goodwill is less than fair value these qualitative factors include but are not limited to overall deterioration in general economic conditions industry and market conditions and overall financial performance if determined that it is more likely than not that there has been a deterioration in the fair value of the carrying value than the first of a twostep process would be performed the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not to be impaired if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment if required the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted management has determined that the company has four reporting units see note  to the consolidated financial statements core deposit intangibles consist of costs that resulted from the acquisition of deposits from savannah river and first south core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of longterm deposit relationships acquired in this transaction these costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the deposit accounts acquired on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from the accounts the estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities including availableforsale securities allowance for loan losses write downs of oreo properties accumulated depreciation net operating loss carry forwards accretion income deferred compensation intangible assets and pension plan and postretirement benefits the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes we file a consolidated federal income tax return for the bank at september   and december   we were in a net deferred tax asset position otherthantemporary impairment we evaluate securities for otherthantemporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis consideration is given to  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer  the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments  the anticipated outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates and  our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value or for a debt security whether it is morelikelythannot that the company will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovering its fair value see note  to the consolidated financial statements business combinations method of accounting for loans acquired we account for acquisitions under fasb asc topic  business combinations which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting all identifiable assets acquired including loans are recorded at fair value no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date because the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk acquired creditimpaired loans are accounted for under the accounting guidance for loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality found in fasb asc topic  receivablesloans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality and initially measured at fair value which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans loans acquired in business combinations with evidence of credit deterioration are considered impaired loans acquired through business combinations that do not meet the specific criteria of fasb asc topic  but for which a discount is attributable at least in part to credit quality are also accounted for under this guidance certain acquired loans including performing loans and revolving lines of credit consumer and commercial are accounted for in accordance with fasb asc topic  where the discount is accreted through earnings based on estimated cash flows over the estimated life of the loan comparison of results of operations for nine months ended september   to the nine months ended september   net income our net income for the nine months ended september   was  million or  diluted earnings per common share as compared to  million or  diluted earnings per common share for the nine months ended september   net interest income increased  thousand for the nine months ended september   as compared to the same period in  this increase resulted from an increase in average earning assets which increased by  million in the nine months ended september   as compared to the same period in  average earning assets were  million during the nine months ended september   as compared to  million during the nine months ended september   the net interest margin decreased to  during the first nine months of  as compared to  during the first nine months of  noninterest income decreased by  thousand in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  this was primarily attributable to a decrease in mortgage banking income and investment advisory fees and nondeposit commissions of  thousand and  thousand respectively in the nine months ended september   as compared to the same period in  noninterest expense in the nine months ended september   increased  thousand as compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of an increase in salary and benefit expense of  thousand from  million in the first nine months of  to  million in the first nine months of  net interest income please refer to the table at the end of this item  for the yield and rate data for interestbearing balance sheet components during the ninemonth periods ended september   and  along with average balances and the related interest income and interest expense amounts net interest income was  million for the nine months ended september   as compared to  million for the nine months ended september   the  thousand increase in net interest income was attributable to an increase in average earning assets of  million partially offset by a decrease of  basis points in the net interest margin between the two periods our net interest margin decreased  basis points from  for the nine months ended september   to  for the same period in  the net interest margin was positively impacted during the first nine months of  as a result of two payoffs on purchased credit impaired loans these two payoffs accounted for approximately  basis points in our netinterest margin for the nine months ended september   during the first nine months of  the net interest margin was positively impacted by an investment that had been purchased at a discount and was called at par during the second quarter of  the  thousand remaining discount recognized in interest income accounted for approximately  basis points of the net interest margin for the nine months ended september   the yield on earning assets decreased by  basis points in the first nine months of  as compared to the same period in  average loans comprised  of average earning assets in the first nine months of  as compared to  in the same period of  the yield on our loan portfolio decreased  basis points in the nine monthperiod ended september   to  as compared to  during the same period in  as previously noted the yield on loans was positively impacted by recognizing the discount on two purchased impaired loans that paid off in the nine months ended september   the yield on our investment portfolio increased from  for the nine months ended september   to  for the same period in  the previously mentioned  thousand discount recognized on a called bond accounted for approximately  basis points of the investment yield increase between the two periods the cost of interestbearing liabilities during the first nine months of  was  as compared to  in the same period of  reflecting a  basis point decrease the continued focus and resulting shift in our deposit funding mix has continued to allow us to lower our overall cost of funds interestbearing transaction accounts money market accounts and savings deposits which are typically our lower costing funds represent  of our average interest bearing liabilities during the first nine months of  as compared to  in the same period of  provision and allowance for loan losses at september   and december   the allowance for loan losses was  million and  million respectively this represented  of total loans and  of total loans at september   and december   respectively no allowance for loan losses related to the savannah river acquired loans was recorded on the acquisition date february   because the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk loans acquired were recorded at the acquisition date fair value which was based on expected cash flows and included an estimation of expected future loan losses for the purchased creditimpaired loans including principal and interest there have been no material adjustments to our original assumptions since the acquisition date at september   and december   the allowance for loan losses plus the fair value adjustment related to credit as a percentage of total loans excluding loans held for sale was  and  respectively our provision for loan losses was  thousand for the nine months ended september   as compared to  thousand for the nine months ended september   this provision is made based on our assessment of general loan loss risk and asset quality the allowance for loan losses represents an amount which we believe will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible our judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a number of assumptions about future events which we believe to be reasonable but which may or may not prove to be accurate our determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans including consideration of factors such as the balance of impaired loans the quality mix and size of our overall loan portfolio the experience ability and depth of lending personnel economic conditions local and national that may affect the borrowers ability to repay the amount and quality of collateral securing the loans our historical loan loss experience and a review of specific problem loans we also consider subjective issues such as changes in the lending policies and procedures changes in the localnational economy changes in volume or type of credits changes in volumeseverity of problem loans quality of loan review and board of director oversight and concentrations of credit periodically we adjust the amount of the allowance based on changing circumstances we charge recognized losses to the allowance and add subsequent recoveries back to the allowance for loan losses we perform an analysis quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio the portfolio is segregated into similar risk components for which historical loss ratios are calculated and adjusted for identified changes in current portfolio characteristics historical loss ratios are calculated by product type and by regulatory credit risk classification see note   loans the annualized weighted average loss ratios over the last  months for loans classified substandard special mention and pass have been approximately   and  respectively the allowance consists of an allocated and unallocated allowance the allocated portion is determined by types and ratings of loans within the portfolio the unallocated portion of the allowance is established for losses that exist in the remainder of the portfolio and compensates for uncertainty in estimating the loan losses the allocated portion of the allowance is based on historical loss experience as well as certain qualitative factors as explained above the qualitative factors have been established based on certain assumptions made as a result of the current economic conditions and are adjusted as conditions change to be directionally consistent with these changes the unallocated portion of the allowance is composed of factors based on managements evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured in the estimation of probable losses through the experience formula or specific allowances the unallocated allowance of the portfolio is primarily identified through discussions with senior credit management and through consideration of various portfolio specifics and other uncertainties outside of our markets that could impact the risk inherent in the portfolio these include factors such as uncertainty as to a sustainable economic recovery ongoing global economic conditions and sustained levels of high national unemployment given these uncertainties in economic conditions and particularly real estate valuations we do not believe it would be prudent to reduce substantially the overall level of our allowance at this time as economic conditions show sustainable improvement we believe the unallocated portion of the allowance should decrease as a percentage of the total allowance our loan portfolio consists of a large percentage of real estate secured loans impaired values of the underlying real estate collateral as well as a slowdown in both residential and commercial real estate sales could impact our ability to sell collateral upon foreclosure the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended if real estate values decline it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses if during a period of reduced real estate values we are required to liquidate the property collateralizing a loan to satisfy the debt or to increase the allowance for loan losses it could materially reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition nonperforming assets were  million  of total assets at september   as compared to  million  of total assets  million  of total assets and  million  of total assets at june   march   and december   respectively while we believe our amount of nonperforming assets compares favorably to current industry results both nationally and locally we continue to be concerned about the impact of this economic environment on our customer base of local businesses and professionals there were  loans totaling  million included in nonperforming status nonaccrual loans and loans past due  days and still accruing at september   the largest nonperforming loan is a  thousand first mortgage on developed lots to be sold for residential use the average balance of the remaining  loans is approximately  thousand and the majority of these loans are secured by first mortgage liens at the time the loans are placed in nonaccrual status we typically obtain an updated appraisal and if the loan balance exceeds fair value write the balance down to the fair value at september   we had one loan delinquent more than  days in the amount of  thousand and still accruing interest at september   we had loans totaling  million that were delinquent  days to  days which represented  of total loans our management continuously monitors nonperforming classified and past due    nov   c  cybernet
