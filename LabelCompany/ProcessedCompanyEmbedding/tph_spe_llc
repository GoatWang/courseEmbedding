references significance and use the presence and concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons as well as oil and grease in domestic and industrial wastewater is of concern to the public because of its deleterious aesthetic effect and its impact on aquatic life regulations and standards have been established that require monitoring of total petroleum hydrocarbons as well as oil and grease in water and wastewater  scope  this test method covers the determination of total petroleum hydrocarbons tph in water and waste water that are extractable from an acidified sample with a cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon for example cyclohexane and measured by ir absorption in the region of   cm   microns polar substances are removed by cleanup with florisil  the method also considers the volatile fraction of petroleum hydrocarbons which is lost by gravimetric methods that require solvent evaporation prior to weighing as well as by solventless ir methods that require drying of the employed solid phase material prior to measurement similarly a more complete fraction of extracted petroleum hydrocarbon is accessible by this method as compared to gc methods that use a time window for quantification as petroleum hydrocarbons eluting outside these windows are also quantified  this method defines oil and grease in water and wastewater as that which is extractable in the test method and measured by ir absorption in the region of  cm  –  microns  this method covers the range of  to  mgl and may be extended to a lower or higher level by extraction of a larger or smaller
