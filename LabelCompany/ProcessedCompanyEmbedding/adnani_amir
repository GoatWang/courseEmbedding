attending the international metal writers conference in vancouver last week i had the opportunity to sit down and talk with amir adnani amir adnani is one of the best executives in the mining space he took the nownyselisted uranium energy corp from concept to production in five years fortune magazine distinguished mr adnani on its ‘ under  ones to watch’ list of north american executives he was selected as one of “mining’s future leaders” by mining journal a ukbased global industry publication as the chairman and founder of goldmining inc amir is now busy building what has already become one of the largest gold resource portfolios in the junior mining space  enjoy  nick hodgefounder outsider club nick hodge hi im nick hodge im sitting here in the coal harbour room of the pan pacific in vancouver with amir adnani the chairman of goldmining inc tsxv goldotc gldlf amir you know its funny we met a couple of years ago just down the street at another hotel here and your company wasnt even called goldmining then it was called brazil resources inc amir adnani i remember that meeting nick hodge quite a lot has changed since then so youve expanded beyond brazil both northward and southward as you continue to execute on your strategy of accumulating ounces of gold and other minerals in the ground and i thought it was time for an update to sit down and then see how the strategys been going because its been paying off quite well so can you tell me more about how youre executing this landbanking strategy amir adnani its one where you have to be disciplined and you have to also sometimes be able to educate and explain to investors how this type of strategy creates value creates value for shareholders i was recently traveling and i almost had to remind an audience that room full of investors that i was presenting to about the company that sometimes they are the reason for the demise of some of the companies that were buying at the bottom of the cycle because investors in the junior resource sector have become so accustomed to believing that the only way to create value is to punch holes in the ground well when we have a bear market and you take a dollar off of your balance sheet and put it into the ground whether you get results or not even if you get stellar results if the market is not in the right mood because sentiment is weak youre not going to get the right reward felt in your share price youre not going to be able to raise money at progressively higher levels youre diluting and you can really destroy value and destroy great deposits by doing this in bear markets what we wanted to do was take advantage of this dynamic in the resource market going back over six years ago or almost seven years now with goldmining where when you see this predictable downturn the markets are so predictably cyclical when it comes to commodities right over  years we see the bull markets bear markets bull market bear market so the bottom of the cycle when youre at bear market territory mathematically you can acquire drilling that has been done for a fraction of what it costs to go drill a new hole you can buy a resource in the ground for a fraction of what the same resource would be worth if the market was in bull market territory so in a way this is really not a new concept many people before us have implemented this model successfully you look at companies like silver standard even randgold was founded on the back of buying assets at the bottom of the cycle and then building those assets out silver standard did the same thing alumina copper some of the biggest names in the resource sector have recognized the benefit to taking advantage of the cycles is to create shareholder value to get back to your point the brazil focus for us was initially important because you also just cant go out there and buy things randomly there has to be a focus on specific jurisdictions and after seven years weve managed to now have established ourselves in northern brazil in para state the central cauca belt in colombia and in southcentral alaska in every area weve created large districtscale opportunities it doesnt happen overnight but you need one thing to go in your favor to make this kind of model a reality a prolonged bear market weve had a prolonged bear market since  when the tsx ventures started to break down and the gold prices started to break out since  in the last seven years weve had probably what six good months last year between the brexit event and trumps victory six good months in a context of seven years thats the ideal environment that we needed to have at goldmining to execute the kind of strategy that were talking about nick hodge well so many people are fearful during times like that you know theyre frozen theyre deer in headlights they dont want to act youve been contrary to them in that respect and youve done really well in executing these acquisitions at a time when no one is looking right investors are fearful the idea is to buy low and sell high but often human psychology just makes us do the opposite of that how have you been able to gut check yourself or how have you been able to say you know now is the time to buy we can do this with minimal dilution we can head in here while asset prices are cheap how do you gut check yourself for that amir adnani well first of all ive seen this strategy play out in the uranium sector as you know with uranium energy corp where ive spent the last  years developing weve had even a longer harder bear market in uranium and in  for example right before the run up in uranium prices we managed to acquire at the bottom of the cycle in uranium prices assets from uranium one a big player back then that helped transform us into a producer and we were able to buy again for cents on the dollar assets that allowed us to join the exclusive club of uranium producers so ive seen firsthand what it can do in terms of value creation in the resource market when you do buy at the bottom of the cycle in the resource business i feel more than any other business depending on what you pay for an asset you can either destroy a lot of value or create a lot of value

daily so part of the gut check has really been having seen and lived through another commodity with another company and executing that by the way were still executing that with uec because as you know weve had a real prolonged bear market in the nuclear side maybe to some extent is also about aligning yourself so a part of the gut check isnt just your own team and your own board and having likeminded people as the team but having likeminded people in terms of the stakeholders so you look at some of the longterm backers that weve had at goldmining people like rick rule and sprott asset management people like marin katusa and doug casey other large institutional investors throughout the world that over the years we have laid out our vision and our strategy to them but then weve gone and executed weve managed to demonstrate through the combination of vision and execution vision and execution and this snowball effect of building a larger critical mass and today having one of the largest resource spaces throughout the americas for any preproduction company its that alignment with likeminded stakeholders who get you to a point where i think you have the right platform to be able to carry on and that to us has been a very important part of this whole strategy as the shareholder base the asset base and then sort of having that commitment and that vision to just be very disciplined to keep taking advantage of the last thing being the cycle if you have that sort of longterm cycle as ive talked about then all the stars align and you can really take advantage of this concept nick hodge so you talk about creating value for shareholders by buying at the bottom of the cycle or the bottom of the market clearly the strategy has paid off if you look at your stock performance over time compared to some of its peers or to some of its benchmarks like the gdxj etf youve clearly outperformed can you speak to that amir adnani well after having been a public company now for six years it really does become an interesting case study almost to put our share price performance next to some of the indices that youve talked about and just say well look amir keeps talking about this acquisition model well how does it work out how does it translate to share price performance today if you look at our share price performance from our ipo in the middle of  to now we have outperformed the tsx venture which is a very good barometer of how we function as a junior resource company the gdxj as a junior gold etf even the smp and thats a remarkable concept to think about after such an extended period of time but more importantly between  and  when the tsx venture lost almost  of its value our shares were practically flat during that time nick hodge thats great amir adnani last year as you know very well when the market did take off we outperformed we were the secondbest performing stock or mining stock on the tsx venture and made the tsx list so weve demonstrated that we have quite a bit of downside protection when things are bad and were making accretive acquisitions as opposed to dilutive ones and when the market turns around theres so much leverage with the size of resource that weve accumulated now that you see that immediate outperformance on the way up so look its an exciting concept we have a lot of money as insiders tied up in this company ourselves insiders in goldmining today still own close to  of the company which is again very meaningful so we feel very passionate about the vision and model weve been at it for seven years we have a lot of our own capital tied up and its an exciting time its exciting to have that window still be open to continue to grow the business this interview was filmed last week in vancouver on

you do the same robert “lucky shot” mcleod govind friedland david forest  philip o’neill morgan poliquin nicole adsheadbell jorge a ganoza durant kevin bambrough brian dalton  amir adnani casey subscribers are very familiar with amir adnani who earned a spot in our bagger club in  in  amir had an idea for a uranium company he had already tasted success in strategic marketing and financial communications and was ready to dive into the resource sector we first visited his projects in  and in  we advised subscribers of the casey energy report to buy uec at under us within ten months the stock had reached us per share before it went to over us that success is what landed amir a spot in caseys bagger club which is exclusive to resource entrepreneurs who have rewarded subscribers with realized gains of  or more the uranium sector has suffered since the fukushima daiichi nuclear crisis in japan caused a major drop in uranium prices and equities in this very difficult uranium market amir has led uec to become one of the lowestcost uranium producers in the world and has set up the company to produce up to  million pounds of uranium within the next few years when uec brought the palangana insitu recovery isr uranium project in south texas into production it was the first isr uranium mine to come online in the united states in five years amir has positioned goliad his second mine to start production during the  calendar year both mines will feed the hobson processing plant which has a capacity of  million pounds amir has proven that he is the  in  able to bring exploration projects into commercial production especially during the volatile markets weve seen over the last few years caused by the global financial crisis and the fukushima disaster amirs newest venture is brazil resources briv which he cofounded in august  and for which he currently serves as chairman of the board brazil resources strategy is to buy advancedstage gold projects at todays low prices focusing on identifying projects that are economic at todays gold prices due to amirs shrewd management bri know sits on four projects with  million ounces of compliant gold resources and recently closed an oversubscribed financing in which industry leaders such as rick rule and doug casey invested their own money with a great management and technical team and a strategic partnership with the brasilinvest group one of brazils largest private merchant banks bri is cashed up and ready to acquire more proven gold projects and to take their projects to the next level through serendipity brazil resources has a large section of land just west of paterson lake in the western portion of the athabasca basin the rea project has a joint venture with areva a major global producer of uranium currently there are only four management teams with uranium production experience in the athabasca and brazil resources is one of thoseamir is a determined smart investor who has poured millions of dollars into his own ventures and his interests are directly aligned with the investors we think amir will achieve the status of the likes of robert friedland in the decades to come greg

northward and southward as you continue to execute on your strategy of accumulating ounces of gold and other minerals in the ground and i thought it was time for an update to sit down and then see how the strategys been going because its been paying off quite well so can you tell me more about how youre executing this landbanking strategy amir adnani its one where you have to be disciplined and you have to also sometimes be able to educate and explain to investors how this type of strategy creates value creates value for shareholders i was recently traveling and i almost had to remind an audience that room full of investors that i was presenting to about the company that sometimes they are the reason for the demise of some of the companies that were buying at the bottom of the cycle because investors in the junior resource sector have become so accustomed to believing that the only way to create value is to punch holes in the ground well when we have a bear market and you take a dollar off of your balance sheet and put it into the ground whether you get results or not even if you get stellar results if the market is not in the right mood because sentiment is weak youre not going to get the right reward felt in your share price youre not going to be able to raise money at progressively higher levels youre diluting and you can really destroy value and destroy great deposits by doing this in bear markets what we wanted to do was take advantage of this dynamic in the resource market going back over six years ago or almost seven years now with goldmining where when you see this predictable downturn the markets are so predictably cyclical when it comes to commodities right over  years we see the bull markets bear markets bull market bear market so the bottom of the cycle when youre at bear market territory mathematically you can acquire drilling that has been done for a fraction of what it costs to go drill a new hole you can buy a resource in the ground for a fraction of what the same resource would be worth if the market was in bull market territory so in a way this is really not a new concept many people before us have implemented this model successfully you look at companies like silver standard even randgold was founded on the back of buying assets at the bottom of the cycle and then building those assets out silver standard did the same thing alumina copper some of the biggest names in the resource sector have recognized the benefit to taking advantage of the cycles is to create shareholder value to get back to your point the brazil focus for us was initially important because you also just cant go out there and buy things randomly there has to be a focus on specific jurisdictions and after seven years weve managed to now have established ourselves in northern brazil in para state the central cauca belt in colombia and in southcentral alaska in every area weve created large districtscale opportunities it doesnt happen overnight but you need one thing to go in your favor to make this kind of model a reality a prolonged bear market weve had a prolonged bear market since  when the tsx ventures started to break down and the gold prices started to break out since  in the last seven years weve had probably what six good months last year between the brexit event and trumps victory six good months in a context of seven years thats the ideal environment that we needed to have at goldmining to execute the kind of strategy that were talking about nick hodge well so many people are fearful during times like that you know theyre frozen theyre deer in headlights they dont want to act youve been contrary to them in that respect and youve done really well in executing these acquisitions at a time when no one is looking right investors are fearful the idea is to buy low and sell high but often human psychology just makes us do the opposite of that how have you been able to gut check yourself or how have you been able to say you know now is the time to buy we can do this with minimal dilution we can head in here while asset prices are cheap how do you gut check yourself for that amir adnani well first of all ive seen this strategy play out in the uranium sector as you know with uranium energy corp where ive spent the last  years developing weve had even a longer harder bear market in uranium and in  for example right before the run up in uranium prices we managed to acquire at the bottom of the cycle in uranium prices assets from uranium one a big player back then that helped transform us into a producer and we were able to buy again for cents on the dollar assets that allowed us to join the exclusive club of uranium producers so ive seen firsthand what it can do in terms of value creation in the resource market when you do buy at the bottom of the cycle in the resource business i feel more than any other business depending on what you pay for an asset you can either destroy a lot of value or create a lot of value so part of the gut check has really been having seen and lived through another commodity with another company and executing that by the way were still executing that with uec because as you know weve had a real prolonged bear market in the nuclear side maybe to some extent is also about aligning yourself so a part of the gut check isnt just your own team and your own board and having likeminded people as the team but having likeminded people in terms of the stakeholders so you look at some of the longterm backers that weve had at goldmining people like rick rule and sprott asset management people like marin katusa and doug casey other large institutional investors throughout the world that over the years we have laid out our vision and our strategy to them but then weve gone and executed weve managed to demonstrate through the combination of vision and execution vision and execution and this snowball effect of building a larger critical mass and today having one of the largest resource spaces throughout the americas for any preproduction company its that alignment with likeminded stakeholders who get you to a point where i think you have the right platform to be able to carry on and that to us has been a very important part of this whole strategy as the shareholder base the asset base and then sort of having that commitment and that vision to just be very disciplined to keep taking advantage of the last thing being the cycle if you have that sort of longterm cycle as ive talked about then all the stars align and you can really take advantage of this concept nick hodge so you talk about creating value for shareholders by buying at the bottom of the cycle or the bottom of the market clearly the strategy has paid off if you look at your stock performance over time compared to some of its peers or to some of its benchmarks like the gdxj etf youve clearly outperformed can you speak to that amir adnani well after having been a public company now for six years it really does become an interesting case study almost to put our share price performance next to some of the indices that youve talked about and just say well look amir keeps talking about this acquisition model well how does it work out how does it translate to share price performance today if you look at our share price performance from our ipo in the middle of  to now we have outperformed the tsx venture which is a very good barometer of how we function as a junior resource company the gdxj as a junior gold etf even the smp and thats a remarkable concept to think about after such an extended period of time but more importantly between  and  when the tsx venture lost almost  of its value our shares were practically flat during that time nick hodge thats great amir adnani last year as you know very well when the market did take off we outperformed we were the secondbest performing stock or mining stock on the tsx venture and made the tsx list so weve demonstrated that we have quite a bit of downside protection when things are bad and were making accretive acquisitions as opposed to dilutive ones and when the market turns around theres so much leverage with the size of resource that weve accumulated now that you see that immediate outperformance on the way up so look its an exciting concept we have a lot of money as insiders tied up in this company ourselves insiders in goldmining today still own close to  of the company which is again very meaningful so we feel very passionate about the vision and model weve been at it for seven years we have a lot of our own capital tied up and its an exciting time its exciting to have that window still be open to continue to grow the business this interview was filmed last week in vancouver on

pm amir adnani saw potential in an evergrowing need for energy and a scarce supply of uranium when i studied and understood what was going on in the uranium market because of the broader development in nuclear industry and the nuclear renaissance i felt like this was a very compelling situation to get involved with he said the entrepreneur has grown uranium energy corp from exploration to production in just five years the companys growth has been fuelled by acquiring other companies and gaining their exploration rights and results the uncluttered field is one of the things that appealed to adnani theres only six or seven companies in the world that mine uranium …  if you set up to become a producer of any other key metal youre one of many he said in uranium youre part of a very exclusive club the company now has several wells using the insitu recovery method which involves pumping water and oxygen into the ground and dissolving and recovering uranium in chemical solutions the practice said adnani is more cost effective and causes less environmental harm than traditional open pit or underground mining methods isr is now used in onethird of global uranium mining looking into the future adnani has ambitious goals for his company our objective over the next two to five years is to expand and increase our uranium production in the us to become the largest

energy corp rick rule  amir adnani  part   how to play the next uranium bull market  sprott global resource investments ltd sprotts thoughts monday july   sprott us media rick rule  amir adnani  part   how to play the next uranium bull market we are pleased to present the second portion of the interview with amir adnani founder of both brazil resources inc and uranium energy corp you can read part i which focuses on gold and brazil resources here in part ii we look at amir’s second public company uranium energy corp uec  amir has founded and managed two publicly traded resources companies which gives him a unique view on the broader resource space  sprott’s thoughts with its exclusive interview with amir conducted my rick rule took the opportunity to understand amir’s view of the market and where he sees opportunities amir notes that uranium is an entirely different commodity cycle particularly as compared to gold the uranium price is currently at a  year low there is exceptional investor fatigue in the space even loathing “that means it’s the ultimate contrarian play because anything i look at in terms of the long term fundamentals is absolutely positive” that’s why in spite of years of a falling uranium spot price amir remains highly optimistic on uranium he believes the coming bull market in uranium will be far more profound than what we experienced in  and  fundamentally the infrastructure to consume uranium is several orders of magnitude larger than what it was  years ago additionally the us – russia heu agreement has come and gone which completely removed  of the supply from the uranium market amir sees a vast structural discrepancy between demand for electricity and what the current base load power the world is able to supply finally as an operator uec and other producers have a unique benefit price elasticity for the owner of the nuclear power plant the price of uranium has an incredibly muted impact on his or her bottom line they are to a certain degree price takers unlike other commodities there is no viable substitute and that is a fundamentally key factor to remember when considering uranium that being said not all uranium companies are poised for success there are only two ways to be competitive in uranium “you’re either on the low end of the capital intensity curve and that in the uranium business means developing in situ recovery projects or you’re on the high end of grade and that means you’re basically in the area that is the persian gulf of the uranium business the athabasca basin” then amir notes you have to look for advantages in permitting and infrastructure amir also answers questions on the broader resource markets with regard to junior resource markets in general amir warns we are few years away from the huge bull market we saw in the s this year’s rally has been a selective one fueling good companies with good projects “investors are being very cautious in terms of how they’re coming back into the sector now” amir noted finally what would amir suggest investors look for in a resource company alignment of interests between the management team and the investors is key according to amir for both uec and bri there’s an active interest by the management teams in acquiring more stock in the case of bri a third of the company is owned by insiders uec is also largely owned by management to hear more specifics on brazil resources new strategy going forward and uec’s target to become one of the lowest cost uranium suppliers in the globe please click below rick rule interview with amir

to risks including a possible loss of the principal amount invested generally natural resources investments are more volatile on a daily basis and have higher headline risk than other sectors as they tend to be more sensitive to economic data political and regulatory events as well as underlying commodity prices natural resource investments are influenced by the price of underlying commodities like oil gas metals coal etc several of which trade on various exchanges and have price fluctuations based on shortterm dynamics partly driven by demandsupply and nowadays also by investment flows natural resource investments tend to react more sensitively to global events and economic data than other sectors whether it is a natural disaster like an earthquake political upheaval in the middle east or release of employment data in the us low priced securities can be very risky and may result in the loss of part or all of your investment  because of significant volatility  large dealer spreads and very limited market liquidity typically you will  not be able to sell a low priced security immediately back to the dealer at the same price it sold the stock to you in some cases the stock may fall quickly in value investing in foreign markets may entail greater risks than those normally  associated with  domestic markets such as political  currency economic and market risks you
