estate investing a road map for underwriting investments that cut against conventional wisdom jul   featured part  a clean outlook apr   part  the city or the burbs apr   part  development and leasing outlook apr    top office owners apr   news state of the reit industry mcdonnough clinton d  jun   many bankers service providers and investors have been enjoying the recent resurgence in the reit market but as the saying goes all good things must end or at least slow down  the reit industry continues to evolve through a maturation process that provides industry watchers with only one sure bet  expect more change the wall after two years of unprecedented growth the industry hit the proverbial brick wall at the beginning of the fourth quarter  most of the theories for why this happened place the blame on rising interest rates but its a bit more complicated than that a market slowdown had started as early as the third quarter  when we saw that  few new equity offering were completed those that were in process were being postponed or pulled indefinitely  few secondary offerings were completed similar to the initial public offerings ipos many that were in process were either pulled or significantly scaled back  reit stock prices declined  to  percent  acquisition activity declined primarily because many acquisitions became dilutive in relation to the stock price what caused the wall  interest rate increases created alternative investment opportunities that diverted capital from the ipos and secondaries and caused selling pressure for the public stock prices the increases in interest rates in  gradually eroded the difference between the reit dividend yields and the return on riskfree investments as this occurred a significant amount of capital left the reit market and was placed into alternative investments  withdrawal of mutual fund investments caused selling pressure for the public stocks and in turn pushed public reit stock prices down the withdrawal was due to the interest rate increases but the poor performance of the mutual funds holding reit shares was a factor to some extent this theory is supported by the decrease in institutional holders of reit stocks during the fourth quarter   lack of retail support of reit stocks also caused downward pressure on stock prices reit stocks needed solid retail support to maintain stock prices this support albeit growing is not yet able to sustain a stock price as retail investors become more sophisticated they will serve as more of a stabilizing factor the future the reit market appears to be very cautious about  and beyond judging from the economic conditions and market activity of early  the following predictions could apply to the next  to  months  capital markets will continue to slow through mid  this slowdown could continue beyond this time frame if we have more than a  basis point increase in interest rates during the first three quarters the one product that may see capital market activity in  is self storage reits similar to the apartment market self storage is largely a momandpop business with low capital cost requirements which lends itself nicely to the reit structure industrial reits also will be active in the next wave apartment and retail sectors on the other hand will have few new ipos as most reitable portfolios already have been taken public  as the capital markets slow the reit lines of credit will be absorbed causing a need for either permanent debt financing or the obtainment of other sources of capital accordingly secured debt financing securitization will become an even more significant financing vehicle for reits in the future  although there are a small number of office reits the uncertainty of lease roll overs and high capital costs reduce the likelihood of office reits coming to market  mergers and acquisitions will increase with wall street playing marriage broker to the reits that they recently brought public  us and foreign pension funds especially uk dutch and german will begin investing in reits as these institutions have only recently allocated money for real estate investmentsboth directly and for the purchase of reit shares  the biggest question mark for  is will the institutions be buyers or sellers in  institutions bought  to  percent of a reit issue after june  they began selling the institutions will return to the reit market in  only if alternative investments have lower yields than reits if reit and alternative investment yields are comparable reits could lose for two reasons  there is a risk premium associated with reit investment and  gains through appreciation are no longer part of the reit equation the silver lining the reit market is reaching a point of greater sophistication and investors are becoming more selective at the same time the consolidation in the reit industry should be mutually beneficial to the market and reit companies because it provides a better basis for investment these mergers could eventually allow companies to procure better credit ratings while concurrently producing new avenues of capital independent of interest rates the restructuring of reit companies can only secure and stabilize their future theres no question there will be consolidation over the next five years but were not going to see an explosion of ma activity says mark decker president of the national association of real estate investment trusts he believes investors have a new comfort level with reits and that there is ample investor interest to support at least four or five good quality ipos this

view of the business and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hardearned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market is that they expect to make money  maybe they find the stock very undervalued or maybe they see exciting progress within the company or maybe both so when stocks turn up that see insider buying and are also top ranked investors are wise to take notice
