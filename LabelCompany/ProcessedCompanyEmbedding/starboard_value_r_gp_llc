current depomed board with a modified slate of six highly qualified nomineesintends to submit today a new record date request notice to depomed and file preliminary proxy materials with the sec for soliciting requests to call a special meetingreiterates significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies questionable capital allocation decisions and egregious actions by the board to stymie strategic interest news provided by starboard value lp may    et share this article new york may   prnewswire  starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard one of the largest shareholders of depomed inc nasdaq depo with an ownership interest in approximately  of depomeds outstanding shares today announced it has delivered an open letter to depomed shareholders and intends to recommence the process for calling a special meeting of depomed shareholders for removing and replacing the current depomed board of directors with a modified slate of six highly qualified director nominees the full text of the letter follows may   dear fellow shareholders starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard currently has an ownership interest in approximately  of the outstanding shares of depomed inc depomed or the company making us one of the companys largest shareholders  we believe that depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the board of directors the board to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders unfortunately as we outlined in our previous letter to depomed on april th we have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies questionable capital allocation decisions and egregious actions taken by the board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring depomed we believe the board clearly lacks the independence objectivity and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders to that end we will be delivering to depomed today a new written request in accordance with depomeds bylaws that the board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting the record date request notice for purposes of seeking to remove and replace the current board this record date request notice supersedes our initial request delivered to depomed dated april   the initial record date request notice  as you may recall the initial record date request notice was delivered to depomed in order to preserve our rights under california law and mitigate the risk that depomed would seek to further amend its governance provisions to suppress shareholder rights since delivering the initial record date request notice we have undertaken an extensive process to carefully vet a slate of highlyqualified nominees that included the evaluation of over  qualified potential candidates we have selected a group of six candidates possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to depomeds business and current challenges including pharmaceutical operations healthcare regulatory finance board governance and oversight and mergers and acquisitions expertise collectively our slate of director nominees has decades of experience serving on wellperforming public company boards importantly this group of nominees if elected at the special meeting is prepared to serve the shareholders of depomed and ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance we appreciate that the board promptly set a record date in response to our initial record date request notice thereby demonstrating that it does not intend to unnecessarily delay the calling of a special meeting by shareholders while we also appreciate the boards intentions in amending its  poison pill rights plan poison pill to facilitate our delivery of the requisite requests from shareholders in order to call the special meeting there are other considerations as a d filer that make us uncomfortable with the idea of soliciting and delivering requests from other depomed shareholders without conducting a public solicitation therefore today we are filing preliminary proxy materials with the sec in furtherance of soliciting the requisite requests to deliver the special meeting request our expectation is that the board will adhere to a similar timetable in setting a record date for this record date request notice as it did with our initial record date request notice and we look forward to calling a special meeting of shareholders in the near future we are confident that you will find the team of professionals we are nominating to be incredibly wellqualified to serve as directors of depomed we have provided detailed biographies of each of our nominees

change is required to ensure depomed is being run in a manner consistent with the best interests of all shareholdershas commenced the process to call a special meeting of shareholders to preserve starboards rights to seek the removal and replacement of the current board news provided by starboard value lp apr    et share this article new york april   prnewswire  starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard one of the largest shareholders of depomed inc nasdaq depo with an ownership interest in approximately  of depomeds outstanding shares today announced it has delivered a letter to president and ceo jim schoeneck and the depomed board of directors the full text of the letter follows april   depomed inc    gateway boulevard suite    newark ca    attn jim schoeneck president and chief executive officer  cc board of directors dear jim starboard value lp together with its affiliates starboard has an ownership interest in approximately  of the outstanding shares of depomed inc depomed or the company making us one of the companys largest shareholders  we believe that depomed is deeply undervalued and that significant opportunities exist to create value for the benefit of all shareholders based on actions that should be within the control of management and the board of directors the board  however we are highly concerned regarding a number of actions that the board has taken which indicate to us that meaningful change is needed to ensure the company is acting in the best interest of all shareholders  specifically we have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies questionable capital allocation decisions and egregious actions taken by the board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring depomed  in combination these concerns lead us to believe that management and the board may be more interested in entrenching themselves than in delivering maximum value for all shareholders as we will discuss in this letter and subsequent materials yesterday we delivered to the company the documentation required under depomeds bylaws to request that the board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting the record date request notice  we understand that we are taking extraordinary actions and are doing so because of our serious concerns with the boards recent actions and long history of shareholderunfriendly tactics   we acquired our position in depomed because we believe that the company is substantially undervalued and opportunities exist to create significant value for shareholders  this includes an opportunity to improve capital deployment rationalize research and development and explore a potential sale of the company given potential operating financial and tax synergies  however while still acquiring our position depomed filed preliminary proxy materials for the upcoming annual meeting with a proposal to change the companys state of incorporation from california to delaware the reincorporation proposal  upon further review we identified unconventional provisions that indicate management and the board are using the reincorporation proposal as a tactic to further entrench themselves by suppressing shareholder rights that currently exist under depomedcalifornia  this is just the latest egregious example of poor corporate governance and entrenchment by this board  apparently it was not enough for the current board to unilaterally adopt onerous and shareholderunfriendly special meeting bylaw provisions in july  as part of its efforts to fend off an unsolicited proposal to acquire the company from horizon pharma plc horizon  now under the guise of the reincorporation proposal the board is attempting to i increase the solicitation requirement to call a special meeting from  of the voting power as it currently stands under california law to  of the voting power as would be required under depomeddelawares bylaws and ii eliminate altogether the ability of shareholders to call a special meeting to remove and replace current board members and iii prevent shareholders for all practical purposes from commencing a special meeting request process within  days of any annual meeting and iv obtain the sole discretion and authority to effect the delaware reincorporation at any time prior to the  annual meeting these are not typical or standard provisions that would reasonably be included in such a reincorporation proposal  these appear to be carefully crafted provisions with the specific intention of further limiting shareholder rights  in addition depomed conveniently failed to disclose some of these material provisions in the reincorporation proposal section of its preliminary proxy and instead chose to bury these significant entrenchment provisions in appendices d and e towards the very end of the proxy  we intend to vigorously oppose the current version of the reincorporation proposal and we advise other shareholders to fully consider these provisions and the significant ramifications they would have on shareholder rights unfortunately these shareholderunfriendly tactics are just the latest attempts by the current board to further entrench themselves  the board took similar actions following horizons unsolicited proposal to acquire the company  specifically on july   the company received an unsolicited offer from horizon to acquire all of the outstanding shares of depomed in an allstock transaction for  per share which represented a  premium to the closing price of  per share on july    at the time this  per share offer price would have represented an alltime high stock price for the company and compares to the current depomed stock price of  per share as of yesterdays close rather than engage with horizon in an attempt to negotiate a valuemaximizing transaction on july   the board adopted bylaw amendments as well as a  poison pill rights plan the poison pill designed to make it as difficult and timeconsuming as possible for shareholders to potentially have a say on horizons offer at a special meeting  nevertheless horizon proceeded to comply with the arduous steps under the special meeting bylaw amendments in order to give shareholders a voice on its offer  institutional shareholder services iss and glass lewis  co glass lewis two leading proxy advisory firms expressed concerns about depomeds shareholderunfriendly bylaw amendments and poison pill and supported horizons efforts to call a special meeting to remove and replace the board noting given that the poison pill and unilateral bylaw amendments adopted by the depomed board materially impact shareholder rights shareholders should provide consent for the special meeting requests – iss september   in this case glass lewis believes it would be in the best interests of depomed shareholders to consent to the calling of the removal and bylaw amendments special meeting and the election special meeting so that the merits of the underlying issues can be more carefully evaluated – glass lewis september   in early august  horizons merger subsidiary filed a lawsuit against depomed and the board seeking to invalidate the bylaw amendments and the poison pill under california law and alleging that the board members had breached their fiduciary duties  that same day depomed filed a lawsuit against horizon alleging among other things a breach of contract and other violations of california law by horizon based on horizons possession and misuse of confidential information it obtained from janssen pharmaceuticals inc janssen under a confidentiality agreement  depomed moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent horizon from continuing with its offer to acquire depomed based on horizons alleged misuse of confidential information which the court granted on november    despite the onerous bylaw requirements horizon was close to submitting the requisite consents for calling the special meeting in midnovember   following the court decision however horizon withdrew its thenincreased offer of  per share  depomed stock reached a high of  on july   following horizons final offer  since then depomeds stock price has declined  resulting in significant losses for shareholders in addition to the decline in depomeds share price shareholders are continuing to pay for the companys illadvised lawsuit against horizon  in  depomed paid approximately  million in legal fees associated with the defense of horizon  shareholders are still paying the companys legal fees as depomed continues a lawsuit that appears to have more to do with management and the boards selfpreservation than protecting the best interests of shareholders  we see no legitimate rationale for the boards continued insistence in proceeding with a lawsuit that deprives shareholders of the potential for an approach by a strategic acquirer  this lawsuit sets a terrible precedent for potential future value creation and significantly undermines the rights of depomed shareholders this company has a troubling record of manipulating depomeds corporate machinery to entrench management and the board  this was clearly evident throughout horizons attempt to acquire the company and has become even more evident with regard to depomeds latest attempt to eliminate altogether the ability of shareholders to seek the removal of board members at a special meeting under the guise of a delaware reincorporation given the apparent willingness of the current board members to take extraordinary action to entrench themselves as exemplified by the reincorporation proposal we have little choice at this time but to immediately commence the process to call a special meeting of shareholders in order to preserve our rights under california law and depomeds current bylaws  therefore yesterday we delivered to the company the documentation required under depomeds bylaws to request that the board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting the record date request notice  depomeds onerous special meeting bylaws require that we put forth our slate of director candidates as part of this initial step in commencing the special meeting process given that the reincorporation proposal was publicly disclosed only three days ago on april   and our view that the members of the board will go to any length to entrench themselves out of an abundance of caution we are immediately nominating six individuals five of whom are starboard value investment professionals  we intend to continue our search for a slate of director candidates that will ensure an experienced diverse and independent board as has been our practice when proposing alternative board slates over the past fourteen years  however we deemed it necessary to take this action to preserve our rights as shareholders and to ensure compliance with depomeds current onerous bylaw requirements so that management cannot further manipulate the bylaws prior to our ability to take action we are taking this extraordinary action because we cannot risk that the current board may seek to further manipulate depomeds bylaws to prevent a lawful special meeting request  we caution the board against taking any steps in response to our special meeting record date request notice to further diminish or suppress the rights of its shareholders to call a special meeting under california law and the companys bylaws we have an ownership interest in approximately  of the outstanding shares of depomed because we believe that significant opportunities exist to create value through better execution improved capital allocation and potentially a sale of the company  we hope to have a constructive dialogue with the company but need to make sure that shareholders interests remain of paramount importance  as such we fully expect that management and the board will halt their pattern of aggressive entrenchment behavior and take no action to further frustrate shareholders rights additionally despite recent rhetoric from management to the contrary we believe that depomed should not be contemplating acquisitions at this time given its levered capital structure and expensive debt to be clear we are not currently advocating for any one particular transaction or any transaction at all but we firmly believe that board change is necessary to best represent the interests of all shareholders as it relates to the ongoing business and any potential transaction opportunities in the future  given your actions and history of actions we cannot take the risk that you further impair our shareholder rights  we intend to share more details with shareholders in the coming weeks regarding our views on the company opportunities for value creation and depomeds significant corporate governance deficiencies best regards            jeffrey c smith   managing member   starboard value lp about starboard value
