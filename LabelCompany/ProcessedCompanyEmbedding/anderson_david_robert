thread after a time christian reached the wicket gate and over it was written “knock and it shall be opened unto you”—john bunyan the pilgrim’s progress in the winter of my fortieth year i was sitting in a doctor’s office squirming to get back to work i was a very busy pastor only there to get some meds for my strep throat and get back in the gamea wise old nurse popped a thermometer in my mouth “let me get your blood pressure” she muttered i took off my coat and rolled up my left sleeve the cuff wheezed and crimped my bicep as i stared at the white wall “what’s your usual blood pressure” the nurse asked me i didn’t know i’d had my blood pressure taken for years no one had ever given me a reading “well it’s high” she said “ over ” the numbers might as well have been a blowout nba game they meant nothing to me but i could tell immediately that something was wrong“i want you to see the doctor reverend”my doctor was kind and upbeat but after taking my pressure for himself he had to deliver the news this was nothing to flirt with hypertension was like plugging a watt body into a  socket “leading cause of stroke” he used words like “heart failure” “aneurysm” and “renal failure” and my numbers were way over the top   i went home with a prescription for prinivil the little blue pill brought my blood pressure down from the danger zone but it was not the medicine for what really ailed me what i most needed was to relax stop working sixteenhour days pull back a bit on the throttle but no doctor could script that only i could and i was not ready things were going too well the small church i had begun to lead four years before was now a rapidly growing congregation attendance was up giving was up it was growing faster than i could manage and we had called the first assistant clergy in the church’s year historyevery sunday the ushers were setting up folding chairs in the aisles and we knew we had to do something we were planning a capital campaign to build a new church more than double the size enlarge the parish hall add sunday school classrooms and build a parking lot a minister’s dreams are made of this stuff i was a “success” over the next two years we completed the building plans and raised close to two million dollars that spring we were lining up building permits and preparing to break ground in the fall but it all went up in smokeat  pm on a mother’s day night the phone beside my bed rang there was a fire at the church i jumped into my jeans and then into the car when i crested the hill on route  still a mile from the church the sky was all orange i groaned as if someone had punched me in the bellythat night along with scores of parishioners who had heard the news i stood on the porch of the house next door and watched it all burn down the school the parish hall with its leaded windows and woodbeamed ceilings and finally the church built of pennsylvania fieldstone in  it was all gone now—my life’s work but it got worse two days later federal atf officials informed me that the fire had been deliberately set this wasn’t just a terrible tragedy it was a horrible senseless crime i fancied myself the victor but i did not know how to be the victim i was fortytwo years old approaching the pinnacle of my career and someone with a gas can and a match had destroyed everythingthis was not what i deserved not what i was promised i was emotionally exhausted and spiritually pissed in public of course i was strong and dependable i preached about forgiving the arsonist i told people god would only use this to make us better stronger more compassionate but in my lonely moments i was foul angry the whole thing was a stupid outrage a few months later my mother died and that loss pushed me over the edge i slid into depressionthe fire that night had been more than a church fire—it was a funeral pyre what had gone up in tall columns of smoke were my sense of who i was the sure promise of life my reliable faith my comforting hope—all of it gone well most of it at the peak of my life when i expected to be strongest in faith i was weakest i was losing it i thought i was finishedi didn’t know it then but what i thought was an end was in fact a beginning and a promising one gradually i realized that what was happening to me was universal one way or another everyone comes to this pyre loses the familiar old and gropes for a way forward that strange and remarkable passage is what i want to share in the pages aheadthis is a book for people whose faith has failed them it’s for people who used to believe people who still pretend to believe who are still teaching their kids to believe still going to church or not it is for people who have felt spiritually numb for years their faith snuffed out with the candle of innocencethis is a book for people who’ve walked to the front of a church to surrender their lives to god maybe more than once people whose prayers used to be answered at least most of the time people who have known jesus in their hearts for years but wonder now whether he was only a figment of their childhood imagination their fixed theological views don’t seem so fixed anymorei write this for men and women who’ve lived long enough to hit a few brick walls for some i’ve discovered that collision comes early maybe for you it was at university or the early years of building a career or raising a family maybe a person or an event outside your control tipped you into the suffering years too soon—stole away your comfortable certitudes and left you to contemplate cold hard reality long before your peersor maybe this is you you’ve got a job but haven’t made it to the top yet and it’s pretty clear you’re never going to you have a house it used to be your “dream house” but now the dream looks scuffed and slightly dated you have a husband or a wife and children but they all pretty much go their separate ways in the morning everyone’s stressed your marriage is on autopilot and you’re too tired to have sex you’ve worked hard been responsible saved for college you took the kids to church until they started playing hockey and soccer on sunday mornings you believe in something eternal but it seems a million miles from where you live any faith you had seems powerless before the problems you face and the questions that haunt you in the night you’ve hit some crisis that calls into question the whole way you’ve been living your life you need to slay a big dragon and you know you’re going to need something more than your old goto faiththe paradox that crisscrosses adult faith is that all the liabilities of aging now become your chief assets only people who have faltered lost a step suffered and died a little are ready for the divine life that cannot be earned or grasped but can only be received as a gift right now all you need to be in line for that gift is a willingness like noah to sail away from the old world—recognize you can’t hold on to what’s passing away—and trust that god is leading you to a place you cannot yet envision that’s why this first passage is the goodbye gatebut this is not a book to take away your faith it is a tract that meets you down at the soul’s lost luggage counter to show you how a renewed and deeper faith grows precisely through loss and disillusionmentfor twenty years as a pastor i’ve had a privileged role as a spiritual guide for men and women trying their best to live lives of faith lives of depth and meaning i’ve been there from birth to death and everything in between there are always seasons of joy and triumph—ilove those times of course but it’s no secret that these are not the spiritual hot spots i’ve learned the hard way that moments of confusion and grief arewhen people are slogging through the slough of despond or enduring the dark night of the soul i’ve been invited to sit with them listen offer advice and support maybe they sought me out because they sensed that my being a pastor had not shielded me from the changes and chances of lifei’ve found myself sitting with women who wanted another baby because they felt their lives had no purpose once their kids were all in school with men at the peak of their powers who had been cashiered at work who bounced like a pinball between rage indignation and depression with couples facing a child’s autism or a teenager’s drug chargestheir words echoed my own “this is not what i expected” “this isn’t right” “how could this happen to me”like most pastors or therapists i look back now and wonder what i could possibly have said to these poor people when i was lost in the same maze with no idea really how to find the way homeit’s been a few years i’m in my midfifties now and while i don’t claim to have arrived i have learned a few things about this trek because i now speak and write about faith lost and found more people ask me for guidance when they feel lost if there’s even a little receptivity i invite people to lean into the pain what are the spiritual dimensions of this crisis when you’re done fidgeting with the levers of the time machine and it’s clear there’s no going back what are you going to do what if failure disruption and endless changes are part of the divine plan what if the life you’re trying desperately to turn around is in fact dragging you assward through the knothole of glory what if the mess you’re trying to clean up is actually god’s masterpiece of nonrepresentational art bricolaged from all the adventures and ordeals of your life and yes that red is bloodover the years i’ve worked with many people who have lost their old faith—sometimes in heartbreaking ways—and finally found their souls almost all of them got pushed into this backhanded blessing they didn’t get there by being especially good or virtuous they fell they got fired they got sick or someone they love got sick they drank themselves into some abyss they lost a lot of money the sheriff served them with papersfor others the fall is more like a long slide the career plateaus the children fail to turn out well collagen dissolves a herniated disk cripples the signature golf swing the golden boy fades to brass and the prom queen falls from grace it’s a gradual descent but the effect is the same they’re lost everything they believed in the landmarks they steered by are gone after that they have to find a new way to live but how do they do that nearly everyone is clueless actually it’s worse than thatlet me explainfor most people the eclipse of an old life presents only one challenge how to get it back if you come to me or to a therapist you’re looking for help in fixing what’s broken solving the problem and getting life back to normal that’s a legitimate response in our youth but those of us who’ve passed the meridian of life need a push can you locate your soul at the bottom of this morass if the old version of you doesn’t work anymore who are you really if success has failed you what actually brings happiness and fulfillment if what you thought was ultimate turns out to be transient what’s truly eternal if the poles of your world have been reversed and the way up is the way down where do you even startinstinctively many people turn to their faith and what they dredge up is a huge disappointment it’s usually some relic of adolescence or the ascendant years of early adulthood some people gave up on religion and faith soon after those early years others have beenmore or less faithful and still end up completely bollixed   earlystage faith is always about polishing the apple for god’s desk it’s all about achievement—religious or spiritual performance being good helping others qualifying for heaven but achievement all the same—which is why it fits perfectly with the first half of life but becomes a serious liability in the second when you need something to access the realm of mystery and inner power you reach for your faith and come up with a memory box filled with old beliefs bromides rules and rituals there’s nothing exactly wrong with any of it except that now it seems antique sentimental useless   plenty of people have sat in my office or in the coffee shop where i meet most seekers and opened that old box some feel helpless others embarrassed this is when i have to deliver the news as painful as it is to file for spiritual bankruptcy it’s just the ticket adult faith begins with a great big ugly death you move through this first passage the goodbye gate have a good cry and let’s move on   “wait just a blessed minute” comes the retort “where do i go from here how do i go from here if spirituality isn’t about being good or doing the right things if it can’t protect me from pain and loss improve my life and help me solve my problems what’s the point”  a suspicious look often follows “since i was a kid people like you—pastors priests people in collars and robes—have been telling me that religion is all about being a better person accepting jesus believing the bible if i believed in god and tried to be the sort of person god wanted me to be i’d be happy in this life and find heaven in the next” they don’t usually finish the thought but the look says“so where do you come off telling me it’s all bunkum”   how do you tell people that everything they’ve ever believed is important necessary and—now—behind them i have often wished i could reach for a guidebook a map of the soul to give to people sitting there so losttwo summers ago my wife pam and i went hiking in vermont we bought a book that detailed scores of beautiful trails in the area and then laced up our boots we started with the easiest paths but after the first week we were physically ready for steeper more rugged climbs what was not quite so ready was our sense of orientation the more challenging trails were hardly worn far less traveled often obscured by undergrowth unlike on the comfy paths we found no friendly printed signs with arrows all we had were the trail map and infrequent blazes many blazes were weathered and disappeared into the mottle of tree bark you could get lost and we did   once we wandered so far off the trail that we ended up in the backyard of a small cottage on the edge of the woods a helpful woman showed us how to get back to the trail we learned on those advanced hikes how to internalize the directions and landmarks from the trail map we developed an eye for blazes and a sense of the intervals between them—when to expect the next one   that’s what i want to give people who are lost midfaith—a simple map with directions for exactly this section of the trail detailing major landmarks and tricky turns you’re certain to miss without help no one gave me that map i was a minister and yet i wasn’t prepared when my steadfast faith buckled beneath me half the stuff i had been peddling from the pulpit was true in theory but i didn’t really know what it meant   when jesus said “for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it” i pretended to get it but i didn’t—not really other less circumspect people lost things not me especially not my life but after the turbulent years of my early forties i sensed that my life had somehow gone lost even if i hadn’t set out to lose it and i had to know the secret of those cryptic words   i picked up a few books on the stages of faith development and was heartened to discover that my predicament was universal as psychologist james hillman says “a symptom suffers most when it doesn’t know where it belongs” i wasn’t alone what was happening to me was part of a predictable pattern of human development knowing that universal pattern is like having a map of your life—with an xthat says “you are here”   of all the books i read on the topic the one that changed my outlook was james fowler’s classic stages of faith the psychology of human development and the quest for meaning i was fascinated by the progression of every stage from infancy to childhood from adolescence to the many incarnations of adulthood but what “spoke to my condition” as the quakers say was the midlife breakdown that happened like clockwork in the lifelong progression of faith this was the big megillah—and i was in it what i was experiencing was a systemic collapse if what i was reading was true however it wasn’t my fault in good time it happens to everybody every human being is equipped from birth with an operating system it’s the basic system that tells you who you are how to behave what is good and true and beautiful how to be a success how to be happy no one ever says “pardon me while i transfer a few files into your operating system” you’re not even aware the system exists it runs in the background and makes everything else possible but no one mentions it just as no one says “now i am breathing” or “now my cerebral cortex is engaging” this operating system serves most of us very well in our early formative years   the problem is this software has a fatal virus it is programmed to guide us to our peak powers and then to crash at some point in our lives what has always worked doesn’t anymore it is as if a curtain is pulled back and what was always just whirring quietly in the background is now revealed it is a system and it’s broken we call it convention the beautiful irony is it cannot be named or even seen until it crashes   that’s where i was at forty maybe that’s where you are now at twentyeight or forty or sixtytwo improbably this turns out to be the golden momentaccording to fowler and the many other prophets of human development recognizing the pervasive power of that conventional system is key to spiritual growth we have to recognize it escape it transcend it that is the task of maturity there are stages before and stages after but this is the big one   in earlier years the transitions flow almost naturally but getting beyond convention is like escaping the hideous tractor beam in star trek for that we need help  as i came to understand this whenever i looked at the adults in my congregation—not to mention my friends my colleagues the characters in nearly every book and movie—i found myself concluding “they’re all stuck in convention” i saw a lot of pain and confusion a lot of resentment and bitterness some tried to keep up religious appearances with a disciplined program of denial others went cool and cynical some were still clinging to the beautiful memories of past faith which can sometimes be relived but with weaker and weaker claims to reality if i could help people recognize what was happening— translate the psychological and theological into the terms of everyday life—i might be able to help people escape the conventional trap and find the path to redemption and happiness   here i offer six passages that lead the way out of the old dying form of your faith and into what is new mysterious and alive beginning with the goodbye gate—the moment when conventional faith breaks down—these passages are designed to lead you through what is often a confusing labyrinth this ancient myth may help to illumine the path   when theseus volunteers to kill the minotaur and so spare the poor athenian children who will otherwise be fed to this awful beast he has two problems killing the halfbull halfman no small task and finding his way back the minotaur crouches at the center of a vast maze on the isle of crete even if theseus can find his way to the center of the maze and manage to slay the beast he will not be able to find his way out it is ariadne who comes to theseus’s aid she gives him a ball of thread which he ties to the entrance door and unwinds as he twists his way to the center after dispatching the minotaur he follows the thread and winds his way out of the labyrinth   that is what i have set out to do here the six passages of this book require something like ariadne’s thread these are the natural pathways of the soul six passages every man and woman must make on the way to a mature adult soul yet they lead through confusing and difficult terrain where the road home is counterintuitive the right way is often the one that appears wrong you need a lead to follow    like the cretan labyrinth these six passages are not a linear progression different people will make these moves in different orders nevertheless each passage is threaded to another finding your way through one opening gives you the wisdom to choose well at the next intersection what you learn in one passage will help you take other important steps along the way   negotiating each passage requires a level of honesty courage and trust available only to those who have come to the end of themselves—and then found a small opening a light and a way forward  that is why this whole endeavor is cloaked in paradox our losses turn out to be necessary—and as such gifts it’s not easy to acknowledge defeat the end of our bestlaid plans but we are never given a new life until we have released the old one that pattern of losingtofind emptyingtobefilled dyingtobereborn is the promise that sings through every passage along every mile of this pilgrimage   i hope you’ll think of me as your ariadne offering you a skein of thread a slender guiding strand a filament of hope that enables you to turn a corner and keep going when everything in your head is crying “go back”   this ball i hold is woven of many strands years of my own experience and that of the men and women i’ve counseled together with threads of merton and jung oliver and eliot and dillard stories of faith hope and love that others have told me along the way tales of losses that became precious endings that birthed beginnings i’ve collected them like bits of string woven them together and wound them one by one over the years they are what inspire and delight me the only things that keep me going   here take this thread you’ll need it for the passage that awaits show more meet the author david robert anderson is an episcopal priest living in darien connecticut a graduate of the university of chicago and yale divinity school he is a

publishing group publication date  pages  product dimensions w x h x d related subjects faith read an excerpt ariadne’s thread after a time christian reached the wicket gate and over it was written “knock and it shall be opened unto you”—john bunyan the pilgrim’s progress in the winter of my fortieth year i was sitting in a doctor’s office squirming to get back to work i was a very busy pastor only there to get some meds for my strep throat and get back in the gamea wise old nurse popped a thermometer in my mouth “let me get your blood pressure” she muttered i took off my coat and rolled up my left sleeve the cuff wheezed and crimped my bicep as i stared at the white wall “what’s your usual blood pressure” the nurse asked me i didn’t know i’d had my blood pressure taken for years no one had ever given me a reading “well it’s high” she said “ over ” the numbers might as well have been a blowout nba game they meant nothing to me but i could tell immediately that something was wrong“i want you to see the doctor reverend”my doctor was kind and upbeat but after taking my pressure for himself he had to deliver the news this was nothing to flirt with hypertension was like plugging a watt body into a  socket “leading cause of stroke” he used words like “heart failure” “aneurysm” and “renal failure” and my numbers were way over the top   i went home with a prescription for prinivil the little blue pill brought my blood pressure down from the danger zone but it was not the medicine for what really ailed me what i most needed was to relax stop working sixteenhour days pull back a bit on the throttle but no doctor could script that only i could and i was not ready things were going too well the small church i had begun to lead four years before was now a rapidly growing congregation attendance was up giving was up it was growing faster than i could manage and we had called the first assistant clergy in the church’s year historyevery sunday the ushers were setting up folding chairs in the aisles and we knew we had to do something we were planning a capital campaign to build a new church more than double the size enlarge the parish hall add sunday school classrooms and build a parking lot a minister’s dreams are made of this stuff i was a “success” over the next two years we completed the building plans and raised close to two million dollars that spring we were lining up building permits and preparing to break ground in the fall but it all went up in smokeat  pm on a mother’s day night the phone beside my bed rang there was a fire at the church i jumped into my jeans and then into the car when i crested the hill on route  still a mile from the church the sky was all orange i groaned as if someone had punched me in the bellythat night along with scores of parishioners who had heard the news i stood on the porch of the house next door and watched it all burn down the school the parish hall with its leaded windows and woodbeamed ceilings and finally the church built of pennsylvania fieldstone in  it was all gone now—my life’s work but it got worse two days later federal atf officials informed me that the fire had been deliberately set this wasn’t just a terrible tragedy it was a horrible senseless crime i fancied myself the victor but i did not know how to be the victim i was fortytwo years old approaching the pinnacle of my career and someone with a gas can and a match had destroyed everythingthis was not what i deserved not what i was promised i was emotionally exhausted and spiritually pissed in public of course i was strong and dependable i preached about forgiving the arsonist i told people god would only use this to make us better stronger more compassionate but in my lonely moments i was foul angry the whole thing was a stupid outrage a few months later my mother died and that loss pushed me over the edge i slid into depressionthe fire that night had been more than a church fire—it was a funeral pyre what had gone up in tall columns of smoke were my sense of who i was the sure promise of life my reliable faith my comforting hope—all of it gone well most of it at the peak of my life when i expected to be strongest in faith i was weakest i was losing it i thought i was finishedi didn’t know it then but what i thought was an end was in fact a beginning and a promising one gradually i realized that what was happening to me was universal one way or another everyone comes to this pyre loses the familiar old and gropes for a way forward that strange and remarkable passage is what i want to share in the pages aheadthis is a book for people whose faith has failed them it’s for people who used to believe people who still pretend to believe who are still teaching their kids to believe still going to church or not it is for people who have felt spiritually numb for years their faith snuffed out with the candle of innocencethis is a book for people who’ve walked to the front of a church to surrender their lives to god maybe more than once people whose prayers used to be answered at least most of the time people who have known jesus in their hearts for years but wonder now whether he was only a figment of their childhood imagination their fixed theological views don’t seem so fixed anymorei write this for men and women who’ve lived long enough to hit a few brick walls for some i’ve discovered that collision comes early maybe for you it was at university or the early years of building a career or raising a family maybe a person or an event outside your control tipped you into the suffering years too soon—stole away your comfortable certitudes and left you to contemplate cold hard reality long before your peersor maybe this is you you’ve got a job but haven’t made it to the top yet and it’s pretty clear you’re never going to you have a house it used to be your “dream house” but now the dream looks scuffed and slightly dated you have a husband or a wife and children but they all pretty much go their separate ways in the morning everyone’s stressed your marriage is on autopilot and you’re too tired to have sex you’ve worked hard been responsible saved for college you took the kids to church until they started playing hockey and soccer on sunday mornings you believe in something eternal but it seems a million miles from where you live any faith you had seems powerless before the problems you face and the questions that haunt you in the night you’ve hit some crisis that calls into question the whole way you’ve been living your life you need to slay a big dragon and you know you’re going to need something more than your old goto faiththe paradox that crisscrosses adult faith is that all the liabilities of aging now become your chief assets only people who have faltered lost a step suffered and died a little are ready for the divine life that cannot be earned or grasped but can only be received as a gift right now all you need to be in line for that gift is a willingness like noah to sail away from the old world—recognize you can’t hold on to what’s passing away—and trust that god is leading you to a place you cannot yet envision that’s why this first passage is the goodbye gatebut this is not a book to take away your faith it is a tract that meets you down at the soul’s lost luggage counter to show you how a renewed and deeper faith grows precisely through loss and disillusionmentfor twenty years as a pastor i’ve had a privileged role as a spiritual guide for men and women trying their best to live lives of faith lives of depth and meaning i’ve been there from birth to death and everything in between there are always seasons of joy and triumph—ilove those times of course but it’s no secret that these are not the spiritual hot spots i’ve learned the hard way that moments of confusion and grief arewhen people are slogging through the slough of despond or enduring the dark night of the soul i’ve been invited to sit with them listen offer advice and support maybe they sought me out because they sensed that my being a pastor had not shielded me from the changes and chances of lifei’ve found myself sitting with women who wanted another baby because they felt their lives had no purpose once their kids were all in school with men at the peak of their powers who had been cashiered at work who bounced like a pinball between rage indignation and depression with couples facing a child’s autism or a teenager’s drug chargestheir words echoed my own “this is not what i expected” “this isn’t right” “how could this happen to me”like most pastors or therapists i look back now and wonder what i could possibly have said to these poor people when i was lost in the same maze with no idea really how to find the way homeit’s been a few years i’m in my midfifties now and while i don’t claim to have arrived i have learned a few things about this trek because i now speak and write about faith lost and found more people ask me for guidance when they feel lost if there’s even a little receptivity i invite people to lean into the pain what are the spiritual dimensions of this crisis when you’re done fidgeting with the levers of the time machine and it’s clear there’s no going back what are you going to do what if failure disruption and endless changes are part of the divine plan what if the life you’re trying desperately to turn around is in fact dragging you assward through the knothole of glory what if the mess you’re trying to clean up is actually god’s masterpiece of nonrepresentational art bricolaged from all the adventures and ordeals of your life and yes that red is bloodover the years i’ve worked with many people who have lost their old faith—sometimes in heartbreaking ways—and finally found their souls almost all of them got pushed into this backhanded blessing they didn’t get there by being especially good or virtuous they fell they got fired they got sick or someone they love got sick they drank themselves into some abyss they lost a lot of money the sheriff served them with papersfor others the fall is more like a long slide the career plateaus the children fail to turn out well collagen dissolves a herniated disk cripples the signature golf swing the golden boy fades to brass and the prom queen falls from grace it’s a gradual descent but the effect is the same they’re lost everything they believed in the landmarks they steered by are gone after that they have to find a new way to live but how do they do that nearly everyone is clueless actually it’s worse than thatlet me explainfor most people the eclipse of an old life presents only one challenge how to get it back if you come to me or to a therapist you’re looking for help in fixing what’s broken solving the problem and getting life back to normal that’s a legitimate response in our youth but those of us who’ve passed the meridian of life need a push can you locate your soul at the bottom of this morass if the old version of you doesn’t work anymore who are you really if success has failed you what actually brings happiness and fulfillment if what you thought was ultimate turns out to be transient what’s truly eternal if the poles of your world have been reversed and the way up is the way down where do you even startinstinctively many people turn to their faith and what they dredge up is a huge disappointment it’s usually some relic of adolescence or the ascendant years of early adulthood some people gave up on religion and faith soon after those early years others have beenmore or less faithful and still end up completely bollixed   earlystage faith is always about polishing the apple for god’s desk it’s all about achievement—religious or spiritual performance being good helping others qualifying for heaven but achievement all the same—which is why it fits perfectly with the first half of life but becomes a serious liability in the second when you need something to access the realm of mystery and inner power you reach for your faith and come up with a memory box filled with old beliefs bromides rules and rituals there’s nothing exactly wrong with any of it except that now it seems antique sentimental useless   plenty of people have sat in my office or in the coffee shop where i meet most seekers and opened that old box some feel helpless others embarrassed this is when i have to deliver the news as painful as it is to file for spiritual bankruptcy it’s just the ticket adult faith begins with a great big ugly death you move through this first passage the goodbye gate have a good cry and let’s move on   “wait just a blessed minute” comes the retort “where do i go from here how do i go from here if spirituality isn’t about being good or doing the right things if it can’t protect me from pain and loss improve my life and help me solve my problems what’s the point”  a suspicious look often follows “since i was a kid people like you—pastors priests people in collars and robes—have been telling me that religion is all about being a better person accepting jesus believing the bible if i believed in god and tried to be the sort of person god wanted me to be i’d be happy in this life and find heaven in the next” they don’t usually finish the thought but the look says“so where do you come off telling me it’s all bunkum”   how do you tell people that everything they’ve ever believed is important necessary and—now—behind them i have often wished i could reach for a guidebook a map of the soul to give to people sitting there so losttwo summers ago my wife pam and i went hiking in vermont we bought a book that detailed scores of beautiful trails in the area and then laced up our boots we started with the easiest paths but after the first week we were physically ready for steeper more rugged climbs what was not quite so ready was our sense of orientation the more challenging trails were hardly worn far less traveled often obscured by undergrowth unlike on the comfy paths we found no friendly printed signs with arrows all we had were the trail map and infrequent blazes many blazes were weathered and disappeared into the mottle of tree bark you could get lost and we did   once we wandered so far off the trail that we ended up in the backyard of a small cottage on the edge of the woods a helpful woman showed us how to get back to the trail we learned on those advanced hikes how to internalize the directions and landmarks from the trail map we developed an eye for blazes and a sense of the intervals between them—when to expect the next one   that’s what i want to give people who are lost midfaith—a simple map with directions for exactly this section of the trail detailing major landmarks and tricky turns you’re certain to miss without help no one gave me that map i was a minister and yet i wasn’t prepared when my steadfast faith buckled beneath me half the stuff i had been peddling from the pulpit was true in theory but i didn’t really know what it meant   when jesus said “for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it” i pretended to get it but i didn’t—not really other less circumspect people lost things not me especially not my life but after the turbulent years of my early forties i sensed that my life had somehow gone lost even if i hadn’t set out to lose it and i had to know the secret of those cryptic words   i picked up a few books on the stages of faith development and was heartened to discover that my predicament was universal as psychologist james hillman says “a symptom suffers most when it doesn’t know where it belongs” i wasn’t alone what was happening to me was part of a predictable pattern of human development knowing that universal pattern is like having a map of your life—with an xthat says “you are here”   of all the books i read on the topic the one that changed my outlook was james fowler’s classic stages of faith the psychology of human development and the quest for meaning i was fascinated by the progression of every stage from infancy to childhood from adolescence to the many incarnations of adulthood but what “spoke to my condition” as the quakers say was the midlife breakdown that happened like clockwork in the lifelong progression of faith this was the big megillah—and i was in it what i was experiencing was a systemic collapse if what i was reading was true however it wasn’t my fault in good time it happens to everybody every human being is equipped from birth with an operating system it’s the basic system that tells you who you are how to behave what is good and true and beautiful how to be a success how to be happy no one ever says “pardon me while i transfer a few files into your operating system” you’re not even aware the system exists it runs in the background and makes everything else possible but no one mentions it just as no one says “now i am breathing” or “now my cerebral cortex is engaging” this operating system serves most of us very well in our early formative years   the problem is this software has a fatal virus it is programmed to guide us to our peak powers and then to crash at some point in our lives what has always worked doesn’t anymore it is as if a curtain is pulled back and what was always just whirring quietly in the background is now revealed it is a system and it’s broken we call it convention the beautiful irony is it cannot be named or even seen until it crashes   that’s where i was at forty maybe that’s where you are now at twentyeight or forty or sixtytwo improbably this turns out to be the golden momentaccording to fowler and the many other prophets of human development recognizing the pervasive power of that conventional system is key to spiritual growth we have to recognize it escape it transcend it that is the task of maturity there are stages before and stages after but this is the big one   in earlier years the transitions flow almost naturally but getting beyond convention is like escaping the hideous tractor beam in star trek for that we need help  as i came to understand this whenever i looked at the adults in my congregation—not to mention my friends my colleagues the characters in nearly every book and movie—i found myself concluding “they’re all stuck in convention” i saw a lot of pain and confusion a lot of resentment and bitterness some tried to keep up religious appearances with a disciplined program of denial others went cool and cynical some were still clinging to the beautiful memories of past faith which can sometimes be relived but with weaker and weaker claims to reality if i could help people recognize what was happening— translate the psychological and theological into the terms of everyday life—i might be able to help people escape the conventional trap and find the path to redemption and happiness   here i offer six passages that lead the way out of the old dying form of your faith and into what is new mysterious and alive beginning with the goodbye gate—the moment when conventional faith breaks down—these passages are designed to lead you through what is often a confusing labyrinth this ancient myth may help to illumine the path   when theseus volunteers to kill the minotaur and so spare the poor athenian children who will otherwise be fed to this awful beast he has two problems killing the halfbull halfman no small task and finding his way back the minotaur crouches at the center of a vast maze on the isle of crete even if theseus can find his way to the center of the maze and manage to slay the beast he will not be able to find his way out it is ariadne who comes to theseus’s aid she gives him a ball of thread which he ties to the entrance door and unwinds as he twists his way to the center after dispatching the minotaur he follows the thread and winds his way out of the labyrinth   that is what i have set out to do here the six passages of this book require something like ariadne’s thread these are the natural pathways of the soul six passages every man and woman must make on the way to a mature adult soul yet they lead through confusing and difficult terrain where the road home is counterintuitive the right way is often the one that appears wrong you need a lead to follow    like the cretan labyrinth these six passages are not a linear progression different people will make these moves in different orders nevertheless each passage is threaded to another finding your way through one opening gives you the wisdom to choose well at the next intersection what you learn in one passage will help you take other important steps along the way   negotiating each passage requires a level of honesty courage and trust available only to those who have come to the end of themselves—and then found a small opening a light and a way forward  that is why this whole endeavor is cloaked in paradox our losses turn out to be necessary—and as such gifts it’s not easy to acknowledge defeat the end of our bestlaid plans but we are never given a new life until we have released the old one that pattern of losingtofind emptyingtobefilled dyingtobereborn is the promise that sings through every passage along every mile of this pilgrimage   i hope you’ll think of me as your ariadne offering you a skein of thread a slender guiding strand a filament of hope that enables you to turn a corner and keep going when everything in your head is crying “go back”   this ball i hold is woven of many strands years of my own experience and that of the men and women i’ve counseled together with threads of merton and jung oliver and eliot and dillard stories of faith hope and love that others have told me along the way tales of losses that became precious endings that birthed beginnings i’ve collected them like bits of string woven them together and wound them one by one over the years they are what inspire and delight me the only things that keep me going   here take this thread you’ll need it for the passage that awaits show more meet the author david robert anderson is an episcopal priest living in darien

your religious upbringing require you to check your brain at the door because it required belief in every word of the bible because it made you feel that you were such an awful sinner you werent good enough for god or because it excluded entire classes of people from salvation did that upbringing lead you to drop your faith entirely but you now feel a spiritual hunger then losing your faith finding your soul is the book for you david anderson leads you on a journey where you must stand apart from your family of origin in order to hear god speak to your own heart the journey continues as you learn to forgive the chapter on forgiveness gave me some new ways of thinking about the topic especially andersons ideas on not taking offense to begin with in the end you come back to those flawed people from your past  and perhaps even the religious tradition you left  with renewed faith and understanding able to love them and yourself through gods grace anderson takes you on this full circle journey with a beautiful command of language and many engaging stories from his own life and work as an episcopal priest i felt renewed in spirit after reading this book able to recognize parts

crown publishing group publication date  pages  product dimensions w x h x d related subjects faith read an excerpt ariadne’s thread after a time christian reached the wicket gate and over it was written “knock and it shall be opened unto you”—john bunyan the pilgrim’s progress in the winter of my fortieth year i was sitting in a doctor’s office squirming to get back to work i was a very busy pastor only there to get some meds for my strep throat and get back in the gamea wise old nurse popped a thermometer in my mouth “let me get your blood pressure” she muttered i took off my coat and rolled up my left sleeve the cuff wheezed and crimped my bicep as i stared at the white wall “what’s your usual blood pressure” the nurse asked me i didn’t know i’d had my blood pressure taken for years no one had ever given me a reading “well it’s high” she said “ over ” the numbers might as well have been a blowout nba game they meant nothing to me but i could tell immediately that something was wrong“i want you to see the doctor reverend”my doctor was kind and upbeat but after taking my pressure for himself he had to deliver the news this was nothing to flirt with hypertension was like plugging a watt body into a  socket “leading cause of stroke” he used words like “heart failure” “aneurysm” and “renal failure” and my numbers were way over the top   i went home with a prescription for prinivil the little blue pill brought my blood pressure down from the danger zone but it was not the medicine for what really ailed me what i most needed was to relax stop working sixteenhour days pull back a bit on the throttle but no doctor could script that only i could and i was not ready things were going too well the small church i had begun to lead four years before was now a rapidly growing congregation attendance was up giving was up it was growing faster than i could manage and we had called the first assistant clergy in the church’s year historyevery sunday the ushers were setting up folding chairs in the aisles and we knew we had to do something we were planning a capital campaign to build a new church more than double the size enlarge the parish hall add sunday school classrooms and build a parking lot a minister’s dreams are made of this stuff i was a “success” over the next two years we completed the building plans and raised close to two million dollars that spring we were lining up building permits and preparing to break ground in the fall but it all went up in smokeat  pm on a mother’s day night the phone beside my bed rang there was a fire at the church i jumped into my jeans and then into the car when i crested the hill on route  still a mile from the church the sky was all orange i groaned as if someone had punched me in the bellythat night along with scores of parishioners who had heard the news i stood on the porch of the house next door and watched it all burn down the school the parish hall with its leaded windows and woodbeamed ceilings and finally the church built of pennsylvania fieldstone in  it was all gone now—my life’s work but it got worse two days later federal atf officials informed me that the fire had been deliberately set this wasn’t just a terrible tragedy it was a horrible senseless crime i fancied myself the victor but i did not know how to be the victim i was fortytwo years old approaching the pinnacle of my career and someone with a gas can and a match had destroyed everythingthis was not what i deserved not what i was promised i was emotionally exhausted and spiritually pissed in public of course i was strong and dependable i preached about forgiving the arsonist i told people god would only use this to make us better stronger more compassionate but in my lonely moments i was foul angry the whole thing was a stupid outrage a few months later my mother died and that loss pushed me over the edge i slid into depressionthe fire that night had been more than a church fire—it was a funeral pyre what had gone up in tall columns of smoke were my sense of who i was the sure promise of life my reliable faith my comforting hope—all of it gone well most of it at the peak of my life when i expected to be strongest in faith i was weakest i was losing it i thought i was finishedi didn’t know it then but what i thought was an end was in fact a beginning and a promising one gradually i realized that what was happening to me was universal one way or another everyone comes to this pyre loses the familiar old and gropes for a way forward that strange and remarkable passage is what i want to share in the pages aheadthis is a book for people whose faith has failed them it’s for people who used to believe people who still pretend to believe who are still teaching their kids to believe still going to church or not it is for people who have felt spiritually numb for years their faith snuffed out with the candle of innocencethis is a book for people who’ve walked to the front of a church to surrender their lives to god maybe more than once people whose prayers used to be answered at least most of the time people who have known jesus in their hearts for years but wonder now whether he was only a figment of their childhood imagination their fixed theological views don’t seem so fixed anymorei write this for men and women who’ve lived long enough to hit a few brick walls for some i’ve discovered that collision comes early maybe for you it was at university or the early years of building a career or raising a family maybe a person or an event outside your control tipped you into the suffering years too soon—stole away your comfortable certitudes and left you to contemplate cold hard reality long before your peersor maybe this is you you’ve got a job but haven’t made it to the top yet and it’s pretty clear you’re never going to you have a house it used to be your “dream house” but now the dream looks scuffed and slightly dated you have a husband or a wife and children but they all pretty much go their separate ways in the morning everyone’s stressed your marriage is on autopilot and you’re too tired to have sex you’ve worked hard been responsible saved for college you took the kids to church until they started playing hockey and soccer on sunday mornings you believe in something eternal but it seems a million miles from where you live any faith you had seems powerless before the problems you face and the questions that haunt you in the night you’ve hit some crisis that calls into question the whole way you’ve been living your life you need to slay a big dragon and you know you’re going to need something more than your old goto faiththe paradox that crisscrosses adult faith is that all the liabilities of aging now become your chief assets only people who have faltered lost a step suffered and died a little are ready for the divine life that cannot be earned or grasped but can only be received as a gift right now all you need to be in line for that gift is a willingness like noah to sail away from the old world—recognize you can’t hold on to what’s passing away—and trust that god is leading you to a place you cannot yet envision that’s why this first passage is the goodbye gatebut this is not a book to take away your faith it is a tract that meets you down at the soul’s lost luggage counter to show you how a renewed and deeper faith grows precisely through loss and disillusionmentfor twenty years as a pastor i’ve had a privileged role as a spiritual guide for men and women trying their best to live lives of faith lives of depth and meaning i’ve been there from birth to death and everything in between there are always seasons of joy and triumph—ilove those times of course but it’s no secret that these are not the spiritual hot spots i’ve learned the hard way that moments of confusion and grief arewhen people are slogging through the slough of despond or enduring the dark night of the soul i’ve been invited to sit with them listen offer advice and support maybe they sought me out because they sensed that my being a pastor had not shielded me from the changes and chances of lifei’ve found myself sitting with women who wanted another baby because they felt their lives had no purpose once their kids were all in school with men at the peak of their powers who had been cashiered at work who bounced like a pinball between rage indignation and depression with couples facing a child’s autism or a teenager’s drug chargestheir words echoed my own “this is not what i expected” “this isn’t right” “how could this happen to me”like most pastors or therapists i look back now and wonder what i could possibly have said to these poor people when i was lost in the same maze with no idea really how to find the way homeit’s been a few years i’m in my midfifties now and while i don’t claim to have arrived i have learned a few things about this trek because i now speak and write about faith lost and found more people ask me for guidance when they feel lost if there’s even a little receptivity i invite people to lean into the pain what are the spiritual dimensions of this crisis when you’re done fidgeting with the levers of the time machine and it’s clear there’s no going back what are you going to do what if failure disruption and endless changes are part of the divine plan what if the life you’re trying desperately to turn around is in fact dragging you assward through the knothole of glory what if the mess you’re trying to clean up is actually god’s masterpiece of nonrepresentational art bricolaged from all the adventures and ordeals of your life and yes that red is bloodover the years i’ve worked with many people who have lost their old faith—sometimes in heartbreaking ways—and finally found their souls almost all of them got pushed into this backhanded blessing they didn’t get there by being especially good or virtuous they fell they got fired they got sick or someone they love got sick they drank themselves into some abyss they lost a lot of money the sheriff served them with papersfor others the fall is more like a long slide the career plateaus the children fail to turn out well collagen dissolves a herniated disk cripples the signature golf swing the golden boy fades to brass and the prom queen falls from grace it’s a gradual descent but the effect is the same they’re lost everything they believed in the landmarks they steered by are gone after that they have to find a new way to live but how do they do that nearly everyone is clueless actually it’s worse than thatlet me explainfor most people the eclipse of an old life presents only one challenge how to get it back if you come to me or to a therapist you’re looking for help in fixing what’s broken solving the problem and getting life back to normal that’s a legitimate response in our youth but those of us who’ve passed the meridian of life need a push can you locate your soul at the bottom of this morass if the old version of you doesn’t work anymore who are you really if success has failed you what actually brings happiness and fulfillment if what you thought was ultimate turns out to be transient what’s truly eternal if the poles of your world have been reversed and the way up is the way down where do you even startinstinctively many people turn to their faith and what they dredge up is a huge disappointment it’s usually some relic of adolescence or the ascendant years of early adulthood some people gave up on religion and faith soon after those early years others have beenmore or less faithful and still end up completely bollixed   earlystage faith is always about polishing the apple for god’s desk it’s all about achievement—religious or spiritual performance being good helping others qualifying for heaven but achievement all the same—which is why it fits perfectly with the first half of life but becomes a serious liability in the second when you need something to access the realm of mystery and inner power you reach for your faith and come up with a memory box filled with old beliefs bromides rules and rituals there’s nothing exactly wrong with any of it except that now it seems antique sentimental useless   plenty of people have sat in my office or in the coffee shop where i meet most seekers and opened that old box some feel helpless others embarrassed this is when i have to deliver the news as painful as it is to file for spiritual bankruptcy it’s just the ticket adult faith begins with a great big ugly death you move through this first passage the goodbye gate have a good cry and let’s move on   “wait just a blessed minute” comes the retort “where do i go from here how do i go from here if spirituality isn’t about being good or doing the right things if it can’t protect me from pain and loss improve my life and help me solve my problems what’s the point”  a suspicious look often follows “since i was a kid people like you—pastors priests people in collars and robes—have been telling me that religion is all about being a better person accepting jesus believing the bible if i believed in god and tried to be the sort of person god wanted me to be i’d be happy in this life and find heaven in the next” they don’t usually finish the thought but the look says“so where do you come off telling me it’s all bunkum”   how do you tell people that everything they’ve ever believed is important necessary and—now—behind them i have often wished i could reach for a guidebook a map of the soul to give to people sitting there so losttwo summers ago my wife pam and i went hiking in vermont we bought a book that detailed scores of beautiful trails in the area and then laced up our boots we started with the easiest paths but after the first week we were physically ready for steeper more rugged climbs what was not quite so ready was our sense of orientation the more challenging trails were hardly worn far less traveled often obscured by undergrowth unlike on the comfy paths we found no friendly printed signs with arrows all we had were the trail map and infrequent blazes many blazes were weathered and disappeared into the mottle of tree bark you could get lost and we did   once we wandered so far off the trail that we ended up in the backyard of a small cottage on the edge of the woods a helpful woman showed us how to get back to the trail we learned on those advanced hikes how to internalize the directions and landmarks from the trail map we developed an eye for blazes and a sense of the intervals between them—when to expect the next one   that’s what i want to give people who are lost midfaith—a simple map with directions for exactly this section of the trail detailing major landmarks and tricky turns you’re certain to miss without help no one gave me that map i was a minister and yet i wasn’t prepared when my steadfast faith buckled beneath me half the stuff i had been peddling from the pulpit was true in theory but i didn’t really know what it meant   when jesus said “for those who want to save their life will lose it and those who lose their life for my sake will find it” i pretended to get it but i didn’t—not really other less circumspect people lost things not me especially not my life but after the turbulent years of my early forties i sensed that my life had somehow gone lost even if i hadn’t set out to lose it and i had to know the secret of those cryptic words   i picked up a few books on the stages of faith development and was heartened to discover that my predicament was universal as psychologist james hillman says “a symptom suffers most when it doesn’t know where it belongs” i wasn’t alone what was happening to me was part of a predictable pattern of human development knowing that universal pattern is like having a map of your life—with an xthat says “you are here”   of all the books i read on the topic the one that changed my outlook was james fowler’s classic stages of faith the psychology of human development and the quest for meaning i was fascinated by the progression of every stage from infancy to childhood from adolescence to the many incarnations of adulthood but what “spoke to my condition” as the quakers say was the midlife breakdown that happened like clockwork in the lifelong progression of faith this was the big megillah—and i was in it what i was experiencing was a systemic collapse if what i was reading was true however it wasn’t my fault in good time it happens to everybody every human being is equipped from birth with an operating system it’s the basic system that tells you who you are how to behave what is good and true and beautiful how to be a success how to be happy no one ever says “pardon me while i transfer a few files into your operating system” you’re not even aware the system exists it runs in the background and makes everything else possible but no one mentions it just as no one says “now i am breathing” or “now my cerebral cortex is engaging” this operating system serves most of us very well in our early formative years   the problem is this software has a fatal virus it is programmed to guide us to our peak powers and then to crash at some point in our lives what has always worked doesn’t anymore it is as if a curtain is pulled back and what was always just whirring quietly in the background is now revealed it is a system and it’s broken we call it convention the beautiful irony is it cannot be named or even seen until it crashes   that’s where i was at forty maybe that’s where you are now at twentyeight or forty or sixtytwo improbably this turns out to be the golden momentaccording to fowler and the many other prophets of human development recognizing the pervasive power of that conventional system is key to spiritual growth we have to recognize it escape it transcend it that is the task of maturity there are stages before and stages after but this is the big one   in earlier years the transitions flow almost naturally but getting beyond convention is like escaping the hideous tractor beam in star trek for that we need help  as i came to understand this whenever i looked at the adults in my congregation—not to mention my friends my colleagues the characters in nearly every book and movie—i found myself concluding “they’re all stuck in convention” i saw a lot of pain and confusion a lot of resentment and bitterness some tried to keep up religious appearances with a disciplined program of denial others went cool and cynical some were still clinging to the beautiful memories of past faith which can sometimes be relived but with weaker and weaker claims to reality if i could help people recognize what was happening— translate the psychological and theological into the terms of everyday life—i might be able to help people escape the conventional trap and find the path to redemption and happiness   here i offer six passages that lead the way out of the old dying form of your faith and into what is new mysterious and alive beginning with the goodbye gate—the moment when conventional faith breaks down—these passages are designed to lead you through what is often a confusing labyrinth this ancient myth may help to illumine the path   when theseus volunteers to kill the minotaur and so spare the poor athenian children who will otherwise be fed to this awful beast he has two problems killing the halfbull halfman no small task and finding his way back the minotaur crouches at the center of a vast maze on the isle of crete even if theseus can find his way to the center of the maze and manage to slay the beast he will not be able to find his way out it is ariadne who comes to theseus’s aid she gives him a ball of thread which he ties to the entrance door and unwinds as he twists his way to the center after dispatching the minotaur he follows the thread and winds his way out of the labyrinth   that is what i have set out to do here the six passages of this book require something like ariadne’s thread these are the natural pathways of the soul six passages every man and woman must make on the way to a mature adult soul yet they lead through confusing and difficult terrain where the road home is counterintuitive the right way is often the one that appears wrong you need a lead to follow    like the cretan labyrinth these six passages are not a linear progression different people will make these moves in different orders nevertheless each passage is threaded to another finding your way through one opening gives you the wisdom to choose well at the next intersection what you learn in one passage will help you take other important steps along the way   negotiating each passage requires a level of honesty courage and trust available only to those who have come to the end of themselves—and then found a small opening a light and a way forward  that is why this whole endeavor is cloaked in paradox our losses turn out to be necessary—and as such gifts it’s not easy to acknowledge defeat the end of our bestlaid plans but we are never given a new life until we have released the old one that pattern of losingtofind emptyingtobefilled dyingtobereborn is the promise that sings through every passage along every mile of this pilgrimage   i hope you’ll think of me as your ariadne offering you a skein of thread a slender guiding strand a filament of hope that enables you to turn a corner and keep going when everything in your head is crying “go back”   this ball i hold is woven of many strands years of my own experience and that of the men and women i’ve counseled together with threads of merton and jung oliver and eliot and dillard stories of faith hope and love that others have told me along the way tales of losses that became precious endings that birthed beginnings i’ve collected them like bits of string woven them together and wound them one by one over the years they are what inspire and delight me the only things that keep me going   here take this thread you’ll need it for the passage that awaits show more meet the author david robert anderson is an episcopal priest living in darien
