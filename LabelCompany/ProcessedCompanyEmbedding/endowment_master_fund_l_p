sec filings the endowment master fund lp has offered investors an exit strategy from the hedge fund offering a new fund through a private placement memorandum ppm which will be used to liquidate the fund  the endowment master fund lp was marketed heavily by wall street firms including merrill lynch  the ppm describes the offer as a likekind exchange of investors’ prorata interest of the portfolio holdings into a new pmf fund lp   according to the sec filings dated february   “the pmf fund lp and the endowment master fund lp will be managed differently with the pmf fund lp managed for purposes of orderly liquidation” for investors the offer provides little certainty because investors must choose whether to liquidate now without knowing the true value of the fund which will be determined at a later date  the offer for the likekind exchange expires march   which requires more than a leap of faith for investors in a hedge fund that has languished far behind the market returns  investors must make an investment decision without knowledge of the value exchanged and how much will be realized during the liquidation period  according to the new york times article after weak returns the endowment fund limits withdrawals the hedge fund “began to struggle in  suffering losses of about  percent after fees compared with a gain of  percent by the sp ”  on february   a thomson reuters article underscores the effects of the substantial hedge fund costs on the funds dismal performance “even for investors who stay with the fund there will be high costs  they will not be permitted to ask for any money back this year  they will also be charged a  percent management fee and a  percent servicing fee  on top of that there will be the fund’s underlying managers’  percent management fee and a  percent of profits as an incentive fee”  the article points to the hedge fund underperformance in  “with the fund earning only  percent last year dramatically trailing the standard  poor’s  percent gain”  for merrill lynch customer’s “if investors accessed the endowment fund through merrill lynch they will have paid as much as a  percent upfront charge” with these costs in mind retail investors are discovering that these fees and costs can evaporate any real or potential profits they can earn  retail investor liquidity concerns make investments in the endowment fund suitable only when they have long enough investment time horizon over multiple market cycles  because of the uncertainties outlined in the pmf fund ppm investors who were advised to invest in the hedge fund now appreciate the risks associated with illiquidity when the funds experience such under performance  fullservice brokerage firms such as merrill lynch are responsible for conducting adequate due diligence concerning the investment vehicles they recommend and whether these investments are suitable for their customers  however with multiple layers of fees costs and incentive bonuses these alternative investments are quickly becoming wall street’s favorite investment products to sell the silver law group has martindale hubbell “av” preeminent peer review™ rated lawyers committed to the

securities and exchange commission the �sec� � item� fee table the following table illustrates the approximate expenses and fees that you will pay if you buy and hold interests in the endowment master fund lp �master fund� the information below and specifically the acquired fund fees and expenses as described below in footnote  are a required disclosure for investment companies that are registered under the  act since the master fund is registered under such act it is required to provide these disclosures other funds that invest in underlying funds �fund of funds� as does the master fund will also incur expenses from the underlying funds in which they invest however these funds are not required to disclose this information to investors if they are not registered under the  act annual expenses as a percentage of average net assets of the master fund � management fee ��   other expenses  ��   acquired fund fees and expenses  ��   �� � � total annual expenses  ��   �  other expenses are estimated based on the master fund�s expenses during the year ended december�  certain administrative and other expenses applicable to feeder funds that invest in the master fund including those of the feeder funds are applied at the feeder fund level rather than at the master fund level �  the acquired fund fees and expenses include the operating expenses and performancebased incentive fees of the underlying investment funds �investment funds� in which the master fund invests the costs incurred at the investment fund level include management fees administration fees professional fees incentive fees and other operating expenses in addition the investment funds also incur trading expenses which may include interest and dividend expenses which are the byproduct of leveraging or hedging activities employed by the investment managers of the investment funds �investment managers� in order to seek to enhance or preserve the investment funds� returns the master funds investments are allocated among many asset classes including absolute return private equity and private real estate among others investment funds with absolute return objectives may on average employ more leverage than certain other types of investment funds thus resulting in higher interest expense amounts being included for some investment funds employing this strategy investment funds that are private equity funds will on average incur higher expense levels early on in the fund�s investment cycle as the investments in this asset class often have a longer term investment horizon which can result in higher expense ratios early in such fund�s investment cycle due to the �j curve effect� investment funds investing in real estate and other depreciable assets may incur depreciation expense which could increase the expense ratio for some of these investment funds in addition for recently launched funds in which the master fund may invest the acquired fund fees and expenses may tend to be significantly greater in the initial years as startup costs are being borne over a smaller invested capital base the acquired fund fees and expenses were calculated in good faith by the adviser there are several components that go into the calculation and for some investment funds complete updated information was not available generally the calculation is based on responses received from the underlying investment funds the most recent shareholder reports the most recent investor communication which in some cases may be the investment funds offering documents or other materialscommunications with the underlying investment funds the fees and expenses disclosed above are based on historic earnings of the investment funds which may and which should be expected to change substantially over time and therefore significantly affect acquired fund fees and expenses in addition the investment funds held by the master fund will change which further impacts the calculation of the acquired fund fees and expenses generally fees payable to investment managers of the investment funds will range from  to  annualized of the average nav of the master fund�s investment in such investment funds in addition certain investment managers charge an incentive allocation or fee generally ranging from  to  of an investment fund�s net profits although it is possible that such ranges may be exceeded for certain investment managers the expenses charged by the underlying investment funds are not paid to the fund or the adviser and represent the costs incurred to invest in the investment funds �     the �total annual expenses� of the master fund disclosed above differ from the ratio of expenses to average net assets master fund expense ratio included in the financial highlights section of the financial statements in the master fund�s  annual report the financial statements in the shareholders report depict the master fund�s direct expenses but do not include in expenses the acquired fund fees and expenses that represent costs incurred at the underlying investment fund level as required to be disclosed in the above table as reported in the financial highlights section of the master fund�s  annual report the master fund�s annual expenses to average partners� capital for the year ended december�  was  �    the purpose of the table below is to assist an investor in understanding the various costs and expenses that an investor in the master fund will bear directly or indirectly for a more complete description of the various fees and expenses of the master fund see the sections entitled �summary of fund expenses� and �fund expenses� in the feeder funds� private placement memorandum �memorandum� included in the feeder funds� registration statement on form n the example is based on the fees and expenses as set forth in the table above including the acquired fund fees and expenses as set out in the table above and should not be considered a representation of future expenses actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown the rate of return of the master fund may be greater or less than the hypothetical  return used in the example a greater rate of return than that used in the example would increase the dollar amount of the investment advisory fee paid by the master fund example � �� ��
