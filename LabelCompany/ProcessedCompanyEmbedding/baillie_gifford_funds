first to commentfinancial adviserby myron jobsonedinburghbased investment management firm baillie gifford has launched a new product which aims to achieve lower volatility than traditional equity markets to sit alongside its suite of multiasset fundsthe new fund called the baillie gifford multi asset growth fund targets annual returns of  per cent ahead of uk base rates net of fees and with annualised volatility of less than  per cent over rolling fiveyear periodsthe fund established as a uk authorised nonucits retail scheme is managed by baillie gifford’s multiasset team manager of a £bn diversified growth fund which closed to new investors in february according to fe analytics statistics the diversified growth fund returned just over  per cent over the past five yearsthe new product can invest in a range of asset classes including gold investment grade bonds developed market government bonds indexlinked bonds and cashaccording to the fund’s literature there is no fixed asset allocation benchmark but there are limits on the maximum exposure to individual asset classes in order to control riskthe fund house will be hosting a number of roadshows about the new funds from  june to  june provider viewpatrick edwardson head of the multiasset team says “many investors are turning to multiasset approaches to deliver attractive returns with lower volatility we do multiasset investing really well at baillie gifford you can see that with our diversified growth fund and the same people who manage that are applying the same process to our new multi asset growth fund we think it’s a really good investment approach and the new fund should be very successful”adviser viewricky chan director and ifa at londonbased ifs wealth  pensions ltd said “i have seen an increase in the number of multiasset fund launches in recent times i think these types of funds are targeted to advisers who are seeking to outsource their investment research proposition for smaller practices it might be more practical to find a fund that suits a client’s attitude to risk by outsourcing the process”he added “it is hard not to pay attention when a large investment house like baillie gifford announces a new fund they have obviously done their own research and identified a gap in the market”chargesthe ongoing charges figure for b accumulation shares is  per cent the annual management charge on b class shares is  per centverdictrecent history has seen a proliferation of new or ‘new and improved’ multiasset strategy launches – at a time of heightened market volatility and less than stellar bond returns the strategy may suit those seeking to invest over the longterm but are unable to stomach the risk associated with a fund with sole exposure to one asset classit is difficult to ignore baillie gifford’s clout in the investment sphere and the new fund is likely to draw attention from intermediaries the fact that the fund is managed by the same team responsible with a good and recent record of producing good returns – albeit for a different product  will go some way to reassuring investors that their money is in capable handsbe the first to commentcomments
