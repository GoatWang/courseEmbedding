improving the quality of your life in fact we are absolutely passionate about it we envision the “internet of things” as being the future and a means to accomplish that mission our company which focuses on creating specialized sensors and software has recently been acquired by conner trebour who has enthusiastically assumed the role of ceo under his new management sensorshare has been revived and we have some incredibly exciting projects in the works when conner first approached sensorshare he was considering it simply as an investment after hearing more about the company and realizing just how much their focus aligned with his own passions and interests he decided to acquire the company instead conner saw a huge amount of potential in sensorshare the concept was different and filled a new space in an untapped market at the time of the acquisition sensorshare was on the brink of dissolution and left uncared for by previous management where some may have lost hope conner was energized by the challenge and propelled into action to rebuild the company unwilling to give up on an incredible product with undeniable potential conner jumped in feet first and began assembling an innovative new team to resurrect the company    sensorshare’s struggling product was the beerbug the first ever realtime digital hydrometer that avid homebrewers could use to track the progress of their precious brew conner and the new team got right to work not knowing exactly what issues they were going to face but that a lot of time money and effort would be necessary to get beerbugs up and running again under connor’s direction two main focuses were prioritized the first was to vastly improve customer service the team was greeted by an overwhelming response from consumers who once loved the product but were now at their wits end with the unreliable software and lack of communication from the previous management team the sensorshare team has used this knowledge to fuel their second focus  solutions and moving forward throughout the long and grueling restoration process the team has made every effort to keep their eager customers updated on the product’s progress and ask for feedback   today sensorshare can proudly say that there are thousands of beerbug owners around the world that would be unable to use their devices with no chance of recovery without the team’s hard work over these first few months of ownership the beerbug would not be where it is today without the team’s unwavering determination to restore the beerbug and passion for its success the sensorshare team is looking forward to a bright future of expanding in the technology and lifestyle industries the team is constantly seeking feedback to discover new ways to improve the consumer’s lifestyle in future versions of the current product as well as branching out to introducing complementary products “i am looking forward to being able to chart our own path in terms of who we are as a company and how to grow in this industry” says trebour “we are excited to continue to improve our current products and in time expand and grow in the internet of things market” we hope that you are just as excited as us to see what sensorshare has in store for your future our brands beerbug wwwthebeerbugcom realtime precise gravity and temperature data on your phone or laptop no need to open the brewing

starter and meet taylor and another member of your team up at a my local homebrew store here in charlotte nc where taylor happily swapped out my original bug with a new version he said was much better i was never able to get that device to properly work either the readings were horribly inaccurate when compared to my hydrometer so i still have it sitting in a box but then i noticed you had posted some updates recently and are still selling the device does this new version accurately work maybe it was a software issue any information on maybe resurrecting the beer bug would be great see
