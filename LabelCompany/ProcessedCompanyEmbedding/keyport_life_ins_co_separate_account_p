reduce administrative and compliance costs to that end it intends to combine the operations of sun life us and keyport through the merger in june  sun life us and keyport entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement pursuant to which keyport will merge with and into sun life us leaving sun life us as the surviving company the merger including the transfers the mva transfer and related transactions has been approved by the boards of directors of sun life us and keyport and each partys sole shareholder the parties have obtained the other necessary formal regulatory approvals and expect to have the merger become effective on december   upon the effective date of the merger effective date sun life us will assume legal ownership of all of the assets of keyport and will become directly liable for keyports liabilities and obligations with respect to the keyport contracts then outstanding each keyport contract owner will become a contract owner of sun life us by operation of law the merger will not affect the provisions of or the rights and obligations under the keyport contracts moreover the merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the keyport contracts nor will the merger affect the values determined under the keyport contracts the net unit value of the keyport accounts in effect immediately after the transfers will be identical to the net asset value per unit of interest in effect immediately before the transfers the merger agreement will not affect the current owners of sun life us contracts the sun life us accounts and the keyport accounts collectively the accounts are not parties to the merger agreement which will be entered into at the insurance company level as a result of the merger the accounts which are registered under the  act will continue to maintain their separate account status as unit investment trusts under the  act and as separate accounts under applicable state insurance law the accounts will not be merged into one another no charges will be imposed on or other deductions made from the keyport accounts or the sun life us accounts in connection with the merger in addition no payments will be required or charges imposed under the keyport contracts in connection with or by virtue of the merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed no new investment options will be made available to owners of the keyport contracts in connection with or by virtue of the merger nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated each subaccount of the keyport accounts will continue to invest in the same underlying fund as that subaccount invested in prior to the merger the merger will not directly affect any of the management investment companies underlying either the keyport accounts or the sun life us accounts collectively the funds the funds will not be a party to the merger or any related transaction the investment objectives policies and restrictions of the funds will not be changed as a result of the merger or any related transaction no investment portfolios are proposed to be added to substituted by or terminated by the funds in connection with the merger or any related transaction moreover the merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the funds the funds assets or the charges imposed on the funds or their shareholders in addition although the principal underwriter for keyport may change after the merger the principal underwriter will continue to be a wholly owned subsidiary of sun life us holdings sun life us and keyport have determined that no provision of the keyport contracts or state law provides the owners of those contracts the keyport contract owners with any right to optout of or to vote on or otherwise consent to the merger rather the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies moreover none of the events affecting the keyport accounts in connection with the merger require a vote of keyport contract owners under the  act in addition as described above the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the keyport contracts will not change except that sun life us will become the depositor of the keyport accounts consequently keyport contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the merger all direct and indirect costs of the merger will be borne by sun life us or keyport and not by any owners of sun life us or keyport contracts b the transfers pursuant to the merger agreement each of the keyport accounts will transfer intact to sun life us and become part of sun life us on the effective date each transferred keyport account will change its name and have sun life us as its depositor rather than keyport no other changes to the keyport accounts will result from the merger the assets and liabilities that comprise the keyport accounts immediately prior to the merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of sun life us as the surviving company after the merger in addition the keyport accounts will continue to fund the same keyport contracts they did immediately prior to the merger after the merger sun life us intends to accept additional payments under the transferred keyport variable contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the contracts currently being offered but for the change in depositor sun life us will administer the keyport variable contracts in the same manner as keyport did immediately prior to the merger c the mva transfer pursuant to the merger agreement keyport will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the keyport mva contracts to sun life us and sun life us will assume keyports obligations under such contracts on the effective date as a result of the merger each nonunitized separate account of keyport that funds the keyport mva contracts will become a nonunitized separate account of sun life us at the same time sun life us will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of keyport and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of keyport under the keyport mva contracts issued prior to the merger the mva transfer will not change the terms of the keyport mva contracts except for the succession of sun life us as the insurer under the keyport mva contracts and it will not adversely affect the values determined under or the economic interests of the owners of those contracts after the merger sun life us intends to accept additional payments under the transferred flex premium mva contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the contracts currently being offered sun life us will administer the flex premium mva contracts in the same manner as keyport did immediately prior to the merger sun life us does not intend to offer additional single premium mva contracts or accept additional payments under outstanding single premium mva contracts or file posteffective amendments to the  act registration statement for the single premium mva contracts d procedural matters sun life us will file new registration statements on form n or form n as applicable under the  act to reflect the change in depositor of the keyport accounts and sun life uss assumption pursuant to the merger of the contractual obligations and liabilities of keyport under the keyport variable contracts the registration statements will include financial statements reflecting consummation of the merger and reflect sun life uss sponsorship of the keyport accounts as a result of the merger but will retain the historical financial information of the keyport accounts sun life us will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the effective date the prospectuses included in the new registration statements will be sent to all keyport contract owners sun life us also will file a new registration statement on form s under the  act for the flexible premium mva contracts sun life us will seek to have the registration statement declared effective on or immediately following the effective date the new registration statement will reflect sun life uss assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of keyport with respect to the flexible premium mva contracts pursuant to the merger each person who owns a keyport mva contract at the time of the mva transfer will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer following the effective date sun life us will not make offers or accept payments under the keyport contracts until the new registration statements filed with the commission are effective iii analysis a introduction as discussed more fully below it is our view with regard to the proposed merger including the transfers and the mva transfer that  section  of the  act and rule  thereunder are inapplicable to the merger and no registration statements on form n are required  section  of the  act is inapplicable to the merger and  section  of the  act is inapplicable to the merger but if section  is viewed as applicable to the merger transactions the transactions will comply with the conditions of section a of the  act and rule a thereunder neither sun life us nor keyport seeks noaction reassurance under section a or section d of the  act with respect to the transfers in support of our views we note that the proposed merger is analytically the same as numerous reorganizations that have been the subject of previous noaction requests seeking substantially identical relief from the provisions of the  act and  act noted above to which the staff responded favorably and which deal with stock and mutual life insurance companies involved in mergers where one or both of such companies issued variable insurance products in connection with the relief sought in this request the proposed merger poses no different issues than those present in these previous transactions b section  of the  act and rule  thereunder are inapplicable to the transfers and the mva transfer  transfers in our view the succession of sun life us to the position of depositor for the keyport accounts and coissuer of the keyport variable contracts pursuant to the transfers and any related transactions will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of section  of the  act or rule  thereunder rule  an interpretive rule adopted by the commission provides guidance on when certain corporate reorganizations may entail the offer or sale of a new security in exchange for outstanding securities of a corporation involved in the reorganization similar to the facts in previously issued noaction letters the terms of the merger agreement will not result in any material change to the keyport variable contracts except that by operation of law the identity of the sponsordepositor will be different these previously issued noaction letters involve circumstances virtually identical to those presented above two insurance companies merging where one or both of the companies have variable contracts outstanding each of the previously issued noaction letters indicates that just as in this case the assets and liabilities that comprised the separate account remained intact after the merger and were legally segregated from the other business of the surviving life insurance company in this case the keyport accounts will remain intact after the merger and the assets of each of the transferred keyport accounts will be legally segregated from all other assets of the depositor and will not be combined with those of any other separate account or other entity the transferred keyport variable contracts will continue to provide contract owners with the same rights and benefits after the proposed merger as before including surrender rights loan privileges annuity options and death benefits in addition the keyport variable contracts will continue to be funded by the transferred keyport accounts albeit under a new name investing in the same underlying investment vehicles as are currently available under the keyport contracts the financial history of the transferred keyport accounts will be carried forward and with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by sun life us which will be reflected by filing an amendment to each registration statement of a keyport account under the  act will not change furthermore the assumption of the insurance guarantees under the keyport variable contracts by sun life us by operation of state law will not affect those aspects of the contracts that cause them to be treated as securities ie the variable nature of the benefits under the keyport variable contracts which benefits will continue to be based on the same pool of assets as discussed above the merger is not subject by either state law or federal securities law to the vote or consent of the contract owners of either sun life us or keyport there is no material change to the security aspect of the keyport variable contracts issued by keyport and no new or different investment options will be made available to the contract owners as a result of the merger the only changes involved are the change in the depositor of the transferred keyport accounts and the assumption of existing keyport variable contracts by sun life us since there will be no vote of the contact owners relating to a new investment decision or otherwise rule  does not apply for the same reasons set forth in the aforementioned noaction letters based on the foregoing we have concluded that neither section  of the  act nor rule  thereunder is applicable to the proposed transfers and any related transactions moreover with respect to registration statements under the  act we believe that no registration statement on form n will be required to be filed in connection with the merger nonetheless we believe that the registration statements for the transferred keyport variable contracts issued through each keyport account as separate accounts of sun life us need to be in effect under the  act to cover any securities issued after the merger which may include any additional payments accepted on the transferred keyport variable contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and any new keyport variable contracts issued thereafter as noted above in connection with effecting the merger sun life us and the keyport accounts will file new registration statements with the commission under the  act for the transferred keyport variable contracts which registration statements will be requested to be declared effective in conjunction with the merger these new registration statements which will be filed on form n or form n as applicable will reflect the change in depositor of the keyport accounts and sun life uss assumption pursuant to the merger of the contractual obligations and liabilities of keyport under the keyport variable contracts because the transfers are to be made in connection with the merger of keyport into sun life us the registration statements also will include appropriate financial information reflecting the merger the new prospectuses will be sent to all owners of keyport variable contracts outstanding at the time the transfers are effected and will retain the historical financial information of the keyport accounts and will disclose that new premium payments will be accepted under the keyport variable contracts after the merger prior to the effective date owners of outstanding keyport variable contracts would have received disclosure from keyport informing the owners of the proposed merger including the transfers  mva transfer in our view the mva transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of section  of the  act no change will be made to the keyport mva contracts by virtue of the mva transfer except that sun life us will succeed keyport as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the keyport mva contracts these rights and benefits ie surrender rights annuity options death benefits etc will remain the same keyport will transfer its nonunitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the keyport mva contracts intact to sun life us consequently when the mva transfer becomes effective sun life us will hold these assets in the same nonunitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer as discussed above owners of keyport mva contracts will not have the opportunity to optout of or to vote on or consent to the merger including the mva transfer and will not by virtue of the merger have available any new or different investment options consequently owners of keyport mva contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the mva transfer we believe however that the registration statement for the transferred flexible premium mva contracts needs to be in effect under the  act to cover any securities issued after the merger which may include any additional payments accepted on the transferred flexible premium mva contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and any new flexible premium mva contracts issued thereafter as noted above in connection with effecting the merger sun life us and the keyport accounts will file a new registration statement with the commission under the  act for the transferred flexible premium mva contracts which registration statement will be requested to be declared effective in conjunction with the merger the new registration statement which will be filed on form s will reflect sun life uss assumption of keyports contractual obligations and liabilities with respect to the contracts pursuant to the merger because the transfers are to be made in connection with the merger of keyport into sun life us the registration statement also will include appropriate financial information reflecting the merger the new prospectus will be sent to all owners of flexible premium mva contracts outstanding at the time the transfers are effected and will disclose that new premium payments will be accepted under the flexible premium mva contracts after the merger prior to the effective date owners of outstanding flexible premium mva contracts will have received disclosure from keyport informing the owners of the proposed merger including the transfers c section  of the  act is inapplicable to the transfer of the keyport accounts it is our view that the succession of sun life us to the position of depositor for the transferred keyport accounts as a result of the merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to section  of the  act and therefore can and should be effected through the amendment of existing registration statements of the keyport accounts under the  act the filing of these amendments with the commission will be made as part of the process of filing new  act registration statements discussed above for the keyport contracts these amendments will reflect sun life us as the depositor of the keyport accounts and the transfer of contractual obligations and liabilities from keyport to sun life us as of the effective date this procedure will not necessitate the filing of new notifications of registration or registration statements for the transferred keyport accounts pursuant to section  of the  act the proposed merger will cause a change in the depositor for the keyport accounts which will involve a change in the coissuer of the keyport contracts the resulting change in the depositor due to the transfers of the keyport accounts however will not change the structure or operations of the keyport accounts or the relationship of the keyport accounts to their depositor or to the keyport contract owners the keyport accounts will continue to be treated as separate entities for all relevant purposes including financial reporting sun life us and the keyport accounts accordingly will amend the existing registration statements for the transferred keyport accounts under the  act on the effective date as discussed above d section  of the  act is inapplicable to the merger based on the analysis set forth above relating to section  of the  act it also is our view that the merger including the transfers and any related transactions will not involve an exchange of securities issued by an investment company for any other security of an investment company for purposes of section  of the  act nonetheless should these transactions be viewed as an offer of an exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of section  of the  act we believe that the transactions will comply with the conditions of section a of the  act and rule a thereunder accordingly commission approval should not be required under section  of the  act in connection with effecting the merger including the transfers and any related transactions similar to the facts in previously issued noaction letters the terms of the merger agreement will not result in any change to the keyport variable contracts except that by operation of law the identity of the depositor will change these previously issued noaction letters involved circumstances substantially similar to those presented above two insurance companies merging with one or both of the companies having variable contracts outstanding each of the previously issued noaction letters indicates that just as in this case the assets and liabilities which comprised the funding separate account after the merger remained intact and were legally segregated from the other business of the surviving life insurance company in this case the assets in each of the transferred keyport accounts will not be combined with those of any other separate account or other entity the transferred keyport variable contracts will continue to provide contract owners with the same rights and benefits after the proposed merger as before including surrender rights loan privileges annuity options and death benefits in addition the keyport variable contracts will continue to be funded by the transferred keyport accounts albeit under a new name the financial history of the transferred keyport accounts will be carried forward and with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by sun life us the keyport variable contracts will not change furthermore the assumption of the insurance guarantees under the keyport variable contracts by sun life us by operation of state law will not affect those aspects of the contracts that caused them to be treated as securities ie the variable nature of the benefits under the keyport contracts iv noaction request in view of these circumstances we respectfully request that the staff issue a letter stating that the staff will not recommend that the commission take any enforcement action against sun life us or keyport under section  of the  act and rule  thereunder in connection with the transfers and the mva transfer or under sections  and  of the  act in connection with the transfers if the merger is effect as described herein in addition we request that the staff further indicate in this letter that the staff will not recommend that the commission take any action if  the change in the depositor for the transferred keyport accounts as a result of the merger is effected through the filing of amendments to the registration statements for the keyport accounts under the  act and  new registration statements for the transferred keyport contracts under the  act are filed by sun life us and the keyport accounts to cover any securities issued in connection with the keyport contracts after the merger is effected if you have any question or require

california department of insurance  see note  supra sun life us currently has no plans to develop and offer additional types of variable contracts through the keyport accounts after the merger  on a number of previous occasions the commission staff has been asked to provide noaction assurances which the staff has granted under sections a and d of the  act in situations when insurance companies

securities of such corporation or other person held by such security holders will become or be exchanged for securities of any other person according to the preliminary note to rule  the thrust of the rule is that an offer offer to sell offer for sale or sale occurs when there is submitted to security holders a plan or agreement pursuant to which such holders are required to elect on the basis of what is in substance a new investment decision whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for their existing security  see the noaction letters cited in note  supra  the merger will affect only the insurance aspects of the keyport contracts ie the insurance company guaranteeing the death benefit and certain other contractual rights and will not affect those aspects that cause the keyport contracts to be treated as securities eg the cash surrender value and investment options available through the keyport accounts  see the noaction letters cited in note  and the accompanying text to note  supra  we note that the form n registration statement by its terms does not apply to separate accounts registered as unit investment trusts  while new registration statements will be filed for certain keyport variable contracts that keyport has ceased offering sun life us will rely on prior commission noaction positions in discontinuing filing posteffective amendments and delivering updated prospectuses to existing owners of these contracts see greatwest supra note  we are not requesting any noaction assurances from the staff with respect to the reliance by sun life us

primarily keyport sells a full range of retirementoriented insurance products grouped by whether they provide fixed indexed or variable returns to policyholders annuities offer a taxfavored means of accumulating savings for retirement needs and provide a taxefficient source of income in the payout period the company earns spread income from fixed and indexed annuities variable annuities primarily produce fee income for the company the companys primary financial objectives are to increase policyholder balances through new sales and asset retention and to earn required investment spreads on its fixed and indexedreturn products fixed annuities the companys principal fixed annuity products are single premium deferred annuities spdas a spda policyholder typically makes a single premium payment at the time of issuance the company obligates itself to credit interest to the policyholders account at a rate that is guaranteed for an initial term typically one year and is reset annually thereafter subject to a guaranteed minimum rate interest crediting continues until the policy is surrendered or the policyholder retires or turns age  equityindexed annuities equityindexed annuities are an innovative product first introduced to the marketplace in  by the company when it began selling its keyindex product the companys equityindexed annuities credit interest to the policyholder at a participation rate equal to a portion ranging for existing policies from  to  of the change in value of a specified equity index keyindex is currently offered for one five and sevenyear terms with interest earnings based on a percentage of the increase in the standard  poors  composite stock price index sp  index sp sp  and standard  poors are trademarkes of the mcgraw hill companies inc and have been licensed for use by the company with the five and sevenyear terms the interest earnings are based on the highest policy anniversary date value of the sp  index during the term keyindex also provides a guarantee of principal at the end of the term thus unlike a direct equity investment even if the sp  index declines there is no market risk to the policyholders principal in late  the company introduced a market value adjusted mva annuity product keyselect which offers a choice between an equityindexed account similar to keyindex and a fixed annuity type interest account keyselect offers terms for each equityindexed account of one three five six and seven years as well as a tenyear term for the fixed interest account keyselect shifts some investment risk to the policyholder since surrender of the policy before the end of the product term will result in increased or decreased account values based on the change in rates of designated us treasury securities since the beginning of the term the company is continuing to develop new versions of the equityindexed annuities including versions registered under the securities act which are designed to be sold through major national brokerage firms variable annuities variable annuities offer a selection of underlying investment alternatives which may satisfy a variety of policyholder riskreturn objectives under variable annuities the policyholder has the opportunity to select separate account investment options consisting of underlying mutual funds which pass the investment risk directly to the policyholder in return for the potential of higher returns variable annuities also include guaranteed fixed interest options the companys keyport advisor variable annuity currently offers  separate account investment choices and four guaranteed fixed interest options while the company currently does not offer traditional life insurance products it manages a closed block of single premium whole life insurance policies spwls a retirementoriented taxadvantaged life insurance product the company discontinued sales of spwls in response to certain tax law changes in the s the company had spwl policyholder balances of  billion as of december   under the internal revenue code returns credited on annuities and life insurance policies during the accumulation period the period during which interest or other returns are credited are not subject to federal or state income tax proceeds payable on death from a life insurance policy are also free from such taxes at the maturity or payment date of an annuity policy the policyholder is entitled to receive the original deposit plus accumulated returns the policyholder may elect to take this amount in either a lump sum or an annuitized series of payments over time the return component of such payments is taxed at the time of receipt as ordinary income at the recipients then applicable tax rate the demand for the companys retirementoriented insurance products could be adversely affected by changes in this tax treatment the companys mix of annuity products is designed to include products in demand under a variety of economic and market conditions sales of spdas tend to be sensitive to prevailing interest rates sales can be expected to increase and surrenders to decrease in interest rate environments when spda rates are higher than rates offered by competing conservative fixed return investments such as bank certificates of deposit spda sales can be expected to decline and surrenders to increase in interest rate environments when this differential in rates is not present as is the case at the date of the filing of this report spda sales also can be adversely affected by low interest rates as is the case

     surrender rates  fixed annuities    indexed annuities    variable annuities    life insurance    sales and asset retention product sales are influenced primarily by overall market conditions impacting the attractiveness of the companys retirementoriented insurance products and by product features including interest crediting and participation rates and innovations and services that distinguish the companys products from those of its competitors the companys insurance products include important features designed to promote both sales and asset retention including crediting rates and surrender charges initial interest crediting and participation rates on fixed and indexed products significantly influence the sale of new policies resetting of rates on spdas impacts retention of spda assets particularly on policies where surrender penalties have expired at december   crediting rates on  of the companys in force spda policy liabilities were subject to reset during the succeeding  months in setting crediting and participation rates the company takes into account yield characteristics on its investment portfolio surrender rate assumptions and competitive industry pricing interest crediting rates on the companys in force spdas ranged from  to  at december   such policies had guaranteed minimum rates ranging from  to  as of such date initial interest crediting rates on new policies issued in  ranged from  to  guaranteed minimum rates on new policies issued during  ranged from  to  all of the companys annuities permit the policyholder at anytime to withdraw all or part of the accumulated policy value premature termination of an annuity policy results in the loss by the company of anticipated future earnings related to the premium deposit and the accelerated recognition of the expenses related to policy acquisition principally commissions which otherwise are deferred and amortized over the life of the policy surrender charges provide a measure of protection against premature withdrawal of policy values substantially all of the companys insurance products currently are issued with surrender charges or similar penalties such surrender charges for all policies except keyindex typically start at  of the policy premium and then decline to zero over a five to seven year period keyindex imposes a penalty on surrender of up to  of the premium deposit for the life of the policy at december    of the companys spdas remained in the surrender charge period surrender charges generally do not apply to withdrawals by policyowners of depending on the policy either up to  per year of the then accumulated value or the accumulated returns in addition certain policies may provide for chargefree withdrawals in certain circumstances and at certain times all policies except for certain variable annuities are also subject to free look risk the legal right of a policyholder to cancel the policy and receive back the premium deposit without interest for a period ranging from ten days to one year depending upon the policy to the extent a policyholder exercises the free look option the company may realize a loss as a result of any investment losses on the underlying assets during the free look period as well as the commissions paid on the sale of the policy while spwls also permit withdrawal it generally would produce significant adverse tax consequences to the policyholder keyports strong financial ratings are important to its ability to accumulate and retain assets keyport is rated a superior by am best aa excellent financial security by standard  poors sp a good financial strength by moodys and aa very high claims paying ability by duff  phelps a is am bests second highest rating sp raised keyports rating from aa to aa in february  these ratings reflect the opinion of the rating agency as to the relative financial strength of keyport and keyports ability to meet its contractual obligations to its policyholders such ratings are not market ratings or recommendations to use or invest in keyport and should not be relied upon when making a decision to invest in the company many financial institutions and brokerdealers focus on the claimspaying ability of an insurer in determining whether to market the insurers annuities if any of keyports ratings were downgraded from their current levels or if the ratings of keyports competitors improved and keyports did not sales of keyports products the level of surrenders on existing policies and the companys relationships with distributors could be materially adversely affected no assurances can be given that keyport will be able to maintain its financial ratings customer service is essential to asset accumulation and retention the company believes it has a reputation for excellent service to its distributors and its policyholders the company has developed advanced technology systems for immediate response to customer inquiries and rapid processing of policy issuance and commission payments often at the point of sale these systems also play an important role in controlling costs keyports operating expense ratio for  was  of assets which reflects keyports low cost operations general account investments premium deposits on fixed and equityindexed annuities are credited to the companys general account investments which at december   totaled  billion to maintain its investment spreads at acceptable levels the company must earn returns on its general account sufficiently in excess of the fixed or indexed returns credited to policyholders the key element of this investment process is assetliability management successful assetliability management requires both a quantitative assessment of overall policy liabilities including maturities surrenders and crediting of interest and prudent investment of general account assets the two most important tools in managing policy liabilities are setting crediting rates and establishing surrender periods the investment process requires portfolio techniques that earn acceptable yields while effectively managing both interest rate risk and credit risk the company emphasizes a conservative approach to assetliability management which is oriented toward reducing downside risk in adverse markets as opposed to maximizing spread in favorable markets the approach is also designed to reduce earnings volatility various factors can impact the companys investment spread including changes in interest rates and other factors affecting the companys general account investments the bulk of the companys general account investments are invested in fixed maturity securities  at december   the companys principal strategy for managing interest rate risk is to closely match the duration of its general account investment portfolio to its policyholder balances at december   the effective duration of its fixed income portfolio was approximately  the company also employs hedging strategies to manage this risk including interest rate swaps and caps in the case of equityindexed products the company purchases sp  index call options to hedge its obligations to provide participation rate returns credit risk is managed by careful credit analysis and monitoring at december   the companys fixed maturity portfolio had an overall average sp rating of a a portion of the general account investments  at december   are invested in below investment grade fixed maturity securities to enhance overall portfolio yield below investment grade securities pose greater risks than investment grade securities the company actively manages its below investment grade portfolio to optimize its riskreturn profile there were no nonincome producing investments in the companys fixed maturity portfolio at december   as of december   the company owned approximately  billion of mortgagebacked securities  of its general account investments  of which were investment grade mortgagebacked securities are subject to significant prepayment and extension risks since the underlying mortgages may be repaid more or less rapidly than scheduled as of december   approximately  billion  of the companys general account investments were invested in securities which were sold without registration under the securities act and were not freely tradable under the securities act or which were otherwise illiquid these securities may be resold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act if the company sought to sell such securities it might be unable to do so at the then current carrying values and might have to dispose of such securities over extended periods of time at uncertain levels marketing and distribution keyports sales strategy is to use multiple distribution channels to achieve broader market presence during  the bank channel represented approximately  of keyports annuity sales and the brokerage channel represented approximately  the sale of insurance and investment products through the bank distribution channel is highly regulated sales through other distributors of insurance products such as financial planners and insurance agents

retirementoriented insurance products generally are issued as individual policies the policy is a contract between the issuing insurance company and the policyholder policy forms including all principal contract terms are regulated by state law in most cases the policy form must be approved by the insurance department or similar agency of a state in order for the policy to be sold in that state keyport and independence are each chartered in rhode island and the state of rhode island insurance department is their primary oversight regulator keyport and independence life also must be licensed by the state insurance regulators in each other jurisdiction in which they conduct business they currently are licensed to conduct business in  states the exception being new york and in the district of columbia state insurance laws generally provide regulators with broad powers related to issuing licenses to transact business regulating marketing and other trade practices operating guaranty associations regulating certain premium rates regulating insurance holding company systems establishing reserve requirements prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and reports performing financial and other examinations determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus regulating the type and amount of investments permitted limiting the amount of dividends that can be paid and the size of transactions that can be consummated without first obtaining regulatory approval and other related matters the regulators also make periodic examinations of individual companies and review annual and other reports on the financial conditions of all companies operating within their respective jurisdictions keyport prepares its statutorybasis financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of rhode island certain statutory accounting practices are prescribed by state laws permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices that are not proscribed such practices may differ between the states and companies within a state the national association of insurance commissioners the naic currently is in the process of codifying statutory accounting practices the result of which is expected to constitute the only source of prescribed statutory accounting practices that project which is expected to be completed in  may result in changes to the accounting practices that the company uses to prepare its statutorybasis financial statements the impact of any such changes on the companys statutorysurplus cannot be determined at this time no assurance can be given that such changes would not have a material adverse effect on the company in recent years various states have adopted new quantitative standards promulgated by the naic these standards are designed to reduce the risk of insurance company insolvencies in part by providing an early warning of financial or other difficulties these standards include the naics risk based capital rbc requirements rbc requirements attempt to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in a companys mix of products and investment portfolio the requirements provide for four different levels of regulatory attention which implement increasing levels of regulatory control ranging from development of an action plan to mandatory receivership as of december   keyports capital and surplus exceeded the level at which the lowest of these regulatory attention levels would be triggered under the insurance guaranty fund laws existing in each state insurers can be assessed for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants because assessments typically are not made for several years after an insurer fails keyport cannot accurately determine the precise amount or timing of its exposure to known insurance company insolvencies at this time for certain information regarding the companys historical and estimated future assessments see note  to the companys consolidated financial statements the insolvency of large life insurance companies in future years could result in material assessments to keyport by state guaranty funds current rhode island insurance law imposes prior approval requirements for certain transactions with affiliates and generally regulates dividend payments by a rhode islandchartered insurance subsidiary to its parent company keyport may not make dividend payments in excess of the lesser of i  of its statutory surplus as of the preceding december  or ii its statutory net gain from operations for the preceding fiscal year without prior approval by the state of rhode island insurance department as of december   such restriction would limit dividends without such approval to approximately  million keyport has not paid any dividends since its acquisition in december  competition the companys business activities are conducted in extremely competitive markets keyport competes with a large number of life insurance companies some of which are larger and more highly capitalized and have higher ratings than keyport no one company dominates the industry in addition keyports products compete with alternative investment vehicles available through financial institutions brokerage firms and investment managers management believes that keyport competes principally with respect to product features pricing ratings and service management also believes that keyport can continue to compete successfully in this market by offering innovative products and superior services in addition financial institutions and brokerdealers focus on the insurers ratings for financial strength or claimspaying ability in determining whether to market the insurers annuities employees as of december   the company had  fulltime employees the company provides its employees with a broad range of employee benefit programs the company believes that its relations with its employees are excellent item  properties as of december   the company maintained its executive

company believes that its fixed and equityindexed policyholder balances should be backed by investments principally comprised of fixed maturities that generate predictable rates of return the company does not have a specific target rate of return instead its rates of return vary over time depending on the current interest rates the slope of the yield curve and the excess at which fixed maturities are priced over the yield curve its portfolio strategy is designed to achieve acceptable riskadjusted returns by effectively managing portfolio liquidity and credit quality the company conducts its investment operations to closely match the duration of the assets in its investment portfolio to its policyholder balances the company seeks to achieve an acceptable spread between what it earns on its assets and interest credited on its policyholder balances by investing principally in fixed maturities the companys fixedrate products incorporate surrender charges to encourage persistency and make the cost of its policyholder balances more predictable approximately  of the companys fixed annuity policyholder balances were subject to surrender charges at december   as part of its assetliability management discipline the company conducts detailed computer simulations that model its fixedmaturity assets and liabilities under commonly used stresstest interest rate scenarios based on the results of these computer simulations the investment portfolio has been constructed with a view toward maintaining a desired investment spread between the yield on portfolio assets and the interest credited on its policyholder balances under a variety of possible future interest rate scenarios at december   the effective duration of the companys fixed maturities investments including certain cash and cash equivalents was approximately  effective duration is a common measure for the price sensitivity of a fixedincome portfolio to changes in interest rates it measures the approximate percentage change in the market value of a portfolio when interest rates change by  basis points this measure includes the impact of estimated changes in portfolio cash flows from features such as prepayments and bond calls as a component of its investment strategy and to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements to match assets more closely to liabilities swap agreements are agreements to exchange with counterparty interest rate payments of differing character eg fixedrate payments exchanged for variablerate payments based on an underlying principal balance notional principal to hedge against interest rate changes the company currently utilizes swap agreements to reduce asset duration and to better match interest earned on longerterm fixedrate assets with interest credited to policyholders the company had  outstanding swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of  billion and had  outstanding swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of  billion as of december   and  respectively cap agreements are agreements with a counterparty which require the payment of a premium for the right to receive payments for the difference between the cap interest rate and a market interest rate on specified future dates based on an underlying principal balance notional principal to hedge against rising interest rates the company had interest rate cap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of  million and  million as of december   and  respectively with respect to the companys equityindexed annuities the company buys call options on the sp  index to hedge its obligations to provide returns based upon this index the company had call options with a book value of  million and  million as of december   and  respectively there are risks associated with some of the techniques the company uses to match its assets and liabilities the primary risk associated with swap cap and call option agreements is counterparty nonperformance the company believes that the counterparties to its swap and call option agreements are financially responsible and that the counterparty risk associated with these transactions is minimal in addition swap agreements have interest rate risk and call options have stock market risk however the swap agreements hedge fixedrate assets the company expects that any interest rate movements that adversely affect the market value of swap agreements would be offset by changes in the market values of such fixed rate assets similarly the call options hedge the companys obligations to provide returns on equityindexed annuities based upon the sp  index and the company believes that any stock market movements that adversely affect the market value of sp  call options would be substantially offset by a reduction in policyholder liabilities however there can be no assurance that these hedges will be effective in offsetting the potentially adverse effects of changes in sp  index levels the companys profitability could be adversely affected if the value of its sp  call options increase less than or decrease more than the value of the guarantees made to equityindexed policyholders the company routinely reviews its portfolio of investment securities the company identifies monthly any investments that require additional monitoring and carefully reviews the carrying value of such investments at least quarterly to determine whether specific investments should be placed on a nonaccrual basis and to determine declines in value that may be other than temporary there were no nonincome producing investments in the companys fixed maturity portfolio at december   in making these reviews the company principally considers the adequacy of collateral if any compliance with contractual covenants the borrowers recent financial performance news reports and other externally generated information concerning the creditors affairs in the case of publicly traded fixed maturity investments management also considers market value quotations if available liquidity the companys liquidity needs and financial resources pertain to the management of the general account assets and policyholder balances the company uses cash for the payment of annuity and life insurance benefits operating expenses and policy acquisition costs and the purchase of investments the company generates cash from annuity premiums and deposits net investment income and from maturities and sales of its investments annuity premiums maturing investments and net investment income have historically been sufficient to meet the companys cash requirements the company monitors cash and cash equivalents in an effort to maintain sufficient liquidity and has strategies in place to maintain sufficient liquidity in changing interest rate environments consistent with the nature of its obligations the company has invested a substantial amount of its general account assets in readily marketable securities at december    billion or  of the companys general account investments are considered readily marketable to the extent that unanticipated surrenders cause the company to sell for liquidity purposes a material amount of securities prior to their maturity such surrenders could have a material adverse effect on the company although no assurance can be given the company believes that liquidity to fund withdrawals would be available through incoming cash flow the sale of shortterm or floatingrate instruments thereby precluding the sale of fixed maturity investments in a potentially unfavorable market current rhode island insurance law permits the payment of dividends or distributions from the company to liberty financial which together with dividends and distributions paid during the preceding  months do not exceed the lesser of i  of statutory surplus as of the preceding december  or ii the net gain from operations for the preceding fiscal year any proposed dividend in excess of this amount is called an extraordinary dividend and may not be paid until it is approved by the commissioner of insurance of the state of rhode island as of december   the amount of dividends that the company could pay without such approval was  million based upon the historical cash flow of the company the companys current financial condition and the companys expectation that there will not be a material adverse change in the results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries during the next twelve months the company believes that cash flow provided by operating activities over this period will provide sufficient liquidity for the company to meet its liquidity needs year  many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century if not corrected many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year  this potential problem has become known as the year  issue the year  issue affects virtually all companies and organizations computer applications which are affected by the year  issue could impact keyports business functions in various ways ranging from a complete inability to perform critical business functions to a loss of productivity in varying degrees likewise the failure of some computer applications could have no impact on critical business functions keyport is assessing and addressing the year  issue by implementing a fourstep plan the first two steps involve inventorying all the computer applications which support keyports business functions and prioritizing computer applications which are affected by the year  issue based upon the degree of impact each has on the functioning of keyports business units the first two steps of the plan are substantially complete the final two steps of the fourstep plan involve remediation of affected computer applications ie repairing or replacing programs including those which interface with thirdparty computer applications that have unremediated year  issues and appropriate testing and reinstallation of computer applications for computer applications which are mission critical ie their failure would result in the complete inability to perform critical business functions keyport expects to complete the final two steps of the plan by december   remediation and reinstallation of noncritical computer applications is scheduled to be completed by december   keyport believes that the year  issue could have a material impact on keyports operations if the fourstep plan is not timely implemented however based upon the progress that is being made keyport believes that the timetable for implementing the plan will be met and that the year  issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems effects of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the companys consolidated results of operations to date the company manages its investment portfolio in part to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations in general the fair value of the companys fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates and the companys net investment income increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes for example if interest rates decline the companys fixed maturity investments generally will increase in fair value while net investment income will decrease as fixed maturity investments mature or are sold and the proceeds are reinvested at reduced rates however inflation may result in increased operating

pronouncements in january  the fasb voted to proceed with the drafting of an accounting standard titled accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities this accounting standard requires companies to report derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in income or equity the accounting standard also changes the accounting for derivatives used in hedging strategies from traditional deferral accounting to a current recognition approach which could impact a companys income statement and balance sheet and expand the definition of a

of retirementoriented insurance products grouped by whether they provide fixed indexed or variable returns to policyholders annuities are insurance products designed to offer individuals protection against the risk of outliving their financial assets during retirement annuities offer a taxdeferred means of accumulating savings for retirement needs and provide a taxefficient source of income in the payout period the company earns spread income from fixed and indexed annuities variable annuities primarily produce fee income the companys primary financial objectives are to increase policyholder balances through new sales and asset retention and to earn acceptable investment spreads on its fixed and indexed return products the companys principal retirementoriented insurance products are categorized as follows fixed annuities fixed annuity products are principally single premium deferred annuities spdas a spda policyholder typically makes a single premium payment at the time of issuance the company obligates itself to credit interest to the policyholders account at a rate that is guaranteed for an initial term typically one year and is reset annually thereafter subject to a guaranteed minimum rate interest crediting continues until the policy is surrendered upon policyholder death or when the policyholder turns age  equityindexed annuities equityindexed annuities are an innovative product first introduced to the marketplace in  by the company when it began selling its keyindex product the companys equityindexed annuities credit interest to the policyholder at a participation rate equal to a portion ranging for existing policies from  to  of the change in value of a specified equity index keyindex is currently offered for one five and sevenyear terms with interest earnings based on a percentage of the increase in the standard  poors  composite stock price index sp  index sp sp  and standard  poors are trademarks of the mcgraw hill companies inc and have been licensed for use by the company with the five and sevenyear terms the interest earnings are based on the highest policy anniversary date value of the sp  index during the term keyindex also provides a guarantee of principal at the end of the term thus unlike a direct equity investment even if the sp  index declines there is no market risk to the policyholders principal in late  the company introduced a market value adjusted mva annuity product keyselect which offers a choice between a fixed and equityindexed account similar to keyindex and a fixed annuity type interest account keyselect offers terms for each equityindexed account of one three five six and seven years as well as a tenyear term for the fixed interest account keyselect shifts some investment risk to the policyholder since surrender of the policy before the end of the product term will result in increased or decreased account values based on the change in rates of designated us treasury securities since the beginning of the term the company is continuing to develop new versions of the equityindexed annuities including versions registered under the securities act of  securities act which are designed to be sold through major national brokerage firms variable annuities variable annuities offer a selection of underlying investment alternatives that may satisfy a variety of policyholder riskreturn objectives under a variable annuity the policyholder has the opportunity to select separate account investment options consisting of underlying mutual funds which pass the investment risk directly to the policyholder in return for the potential of higher returns variable annuities also include guaranteed fixed interest options the company has several different variable annuity products that currently offer  to  separate account investment choices depending on the product and four guaranteed fixed interest options while the company currently does not offer traditional life insurance products it manages a closed block of single premium whole life insurance policies spwls a retirementoriented taxadvantaged life insurance product the company discontinued sales of spwls in response to certain tax law changes in the s the company had spwl policyholder balances of  billion as of december   under the internal revenue code returns credited on annuities and life insurance policies during the accumulation period the period during which interest or other returns are credited are not subject to federal or state income tax proceeds payable on death from a life insurance policy are also free from such taxes at the maturity or payment date of an annuity policy the policyholder is entitled to receive the original deposit plus accumulated returns the policyholder may elect to take this amount in either a lump sum or an annuitized series of payments over time the return component of such payments is taxed at the time of receipt as ordinary income at the recipients then applicable tax rate the demand for the companys retirementoriented insurance products could be adversely affected by changes in this tax law the following table sets forth

fixed annuities    equity indexed annuities    variable annuities    life insurance    sales and asset retention product sales are influenced primarily by overall market conditions impacting the attractiveness of the companys retirementoriented insurance products and by product features including interest crediting and participation rates and innovations and services that distinguish the companys products from those of its competitors the companys mix of annuity products is designed to include products in demand under a variety of economic and market conditions sales of spdas tend to be sensitive to prevailing interest rates sales can be expected to increase and surrenders to decrease in interest rate environments when spda rates are higher than rates offered by competing conservative fixed return investments such as bank certificates of deposit spda sales can be expected to decline and surrenders to increase in interest rate environments when this differential in rates is not present as has been the case during  and at the date of filing of this report spda sales also can be adversely affected by low interest rates as has been the case during  and at the date of filing of this report the company believes that the lack of significant growth in the sale of the companys spdas has resulted primarily from this type of low interest rate environment conversely sales of variable annuities can be expected to increase and surrenders of such products to decrease in a rising equity market low interest rate environment similarly sales of equityindexed annuities can be expected to increase and surrenders to decrease in a rising equity market low interest rate environment while economic conditions may be generally favorable high market volatility as has been the case during  and at the date of filing of this report will result in a higher cost of options associated with equityindexed annuities the result of the higher option costs is a reduction in participation rates which occurred throughout the year the companys insurance products include important features designed to promote both sales and asset retention including crediting rates and surrender charges initial interest crediting and participation rates on fixed and equityindexed products significantly influence the sale of new policies resetting of rates on spdas impacts retention of spda assets particularly on policies where surrender penalties have expired at december   crediting rates on  of the companys in force spda policy liabilities were subject to reset during the succeeding  months in setting crediting and participation rates the company takes into account yield characteristics on its investment portfolio surrender rate assumptions and competitive industry pricing interest crediting rates on the companys in force spdas ranged from  to  at december   such policies had guaranteed minimum rates ranging from  to  as of such date initial interest crediting rates on new policies issued in  ranged from  to  guaranteed minimum rates on new policies issued during  ranged from  to  substantially all of the companys annuities permit the policyholder at anytime to withdraw all or part of the accumulated policy value premature termination of an annuity policy results in the loss by the company of anticipated future earnings related to the premium deposit and the accelerated recognition of the expenses related to policy acquisition principally commissions which otherwise are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the policy surrender charges provide a measure of protection against premature withdrawal of policy values substantially all of the companys insurance products currently are issued with surrender charges or similar penalties such surrender charges for all policies except keyindex typically start at  of the policy premium and then decline to zero over a five to seven year period keyindex imposes a penalty on surrender of up to  of the premium deposit for the life of the policy at december    of the companys fixed annuity policyholder balances were subject to surrender charges or restrictions surrender charges generally do not apply to withdrawals by policyowners of depending on the policy either up to  per year of the then accumulated value or the accumulated returns in addition certain policies may provide for chargefree withdrawals in certain circumstances and at certain times all policies except for certain variable annuities are also subject to free look risk the legal right of a policyholder to cancel the policy and receive back the premium deposit without interest for a period ranging from ten days to one year depending upon the policy to the extent a policyholder exercises the free look option the company may realize a loss as a result of any investment losses on the underlying assets during the free look period as well as the commissions paid on the sale of the policy while spwls also permit withdrawal it generally would produce significant adverse tax consequences to the policyholder keyports strong financial ratings are important to its ability to accumulate and retain assets keyport is rated a excellent by am best aa very strong financial security by standard  poors sp a good by moodys and aa very high claimspaying ability by duff  phelps rating agencies periodically review the ratings they issue sp raised keyports rating from aa to aa in march  and reaffirmed that rating in january  in september  moodys reduced keyports rating from a to a in january  am best reduced keyports rating from a to a these ratings reflect the opinion of the rating agency as to the relative financial strength of keyport and keyports ability to meet its contractual obligations to its policyholders such ratings are not market ratings or recommendations to use or invest in keyport and should not be relied upon when making a decision to invest in the company many financial institutions and brokerdealers focus on the claimspaying ability of an insurer in determining whether to market the insurers annuities if any of keyports ratings were downgraded from their current levels or if the ratings of keyports competitors improved and keyports did not sales of keyports products the level of surrenders on existing policies and the companys relationships with distributors could be materially adversely affected no assurances can be given that keyport will be able to maintain its financial ratings the companys sp rating was placed under credit watch with negative implications as a consequence of an acquisition announced by liberty mutual in january  customer service is essential to asset accumulation and retention the company believes it has a reputation for excellent service to its distributors and its policyholders the company has developed advanced technology systems for immediate response to customer inquiries and rapid processing of policy issuance and commission payments often at the point of sale these systems also play an important role in controlling costs the companys operating expense ratio for  and  was  and  of assets respectively which reflects the companys low cost operations general account investments premium deposits on fixed and equityindexed annuities are credited to the companys general account investments which at december   totaled  billion general account investments include cash and cash equivalents to maintain its investment spread at acceptable levels the company must earn returns on its general account sufficiently in excess of the fixed or indexed returns credited to policyholders the key element of this investment process is assetliability management successful assetliability management requires both a quantitative assessment of overall policy liabilities including maturities surrenders and crediting of interest and prudent investment of general account assets the two most important tools in managing policy liabilities are setting crediting rates and establishing surrender periods the investment process requires portfolio techniques that earn acceptable yields while effectively managing both interest rate risk and credit risk the company emphasizes a conservative approach to assetliability management which is oriented toward reducing downside risk in adverse markets as opposed to maximizing spread in favorable markets the approach is also designed to reduce earnings volatility various factors can impact the companys investment spread including changes in interest rates and other factors affecting the companys general account investments the bulk of the companys general account investments are invested in fixed maturity securities  at december   the companys principal strategy for managing interest rate risk is to closely match the duration of its general account investment portfolio to its policyholder balances the company also employs hedging strategies to manage this risk including interest rate swaps and caps in the case of equityindexed products the company purchases sp  index call options and futures to hedge its obligations to provide participation rate returns credit risk is managed by careful credit analysis and monitoring a portion of the general account investments  at december   is invested in below investment grade fixed maturity securities to enhance overall portfolio yield below investment grade securities pose greater risks than investment grade securities the company actively manages its below investment grade portfolio to optimize its riskreturn profile at december   the carrying value of fixed maturity investments that were nonincome producing was  million which constituted  of investments as of december   the company owned approximately  billion of mortgagebacked securities  of its general account investments  of which were investment grade mortgagebacked securities are subject to significant prepayment and extension risks since the underlying mortgages may be repaid more or less rapidly than scheduled as of december   approximately  billion  of the companys general account investments were invested in securities that were sold without registration under the securities act and were not freely tradable under the securities act or which were otherwise illiquid these securities may be resold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act if the company sought to sell such securities it might be unable to do so at the then current carrying values and might have to dispose of such securities over extended periods of time at uncertain levels marketing and distribution keyports sales strategy is to use multiple distribution channels to achieve broader market presence during  the bank channel represented approximately  of keyports annuity sales and the brokerage channel represented approximately  the sale of insurance and investment products through the

the companys business activities are extensively regulated the following briefly summarizes the principal regulatory requirements and certain related matters keyports retirementoriented insurance products generally are issued as individual policies the policy is a contract between the issuing insurance company and the policyholder state law regulates policy forms including all principal contract terms in most cases the policy form must be approved by the insurance department or similar agency of a state in order for the policy to be sold in that state keyport and independence life are chartered in rhode island and the state of rhode island insurance department is their primary oversight regulator keyport benefit is chartered in the state of new york and the new york department of insurance is its primary oversight regulator keyport benefit operates exclusively in new york and rhode island keyport and independence life also must be licensed by the state insurance regulators in each other jurisdiction in which they conduct business they currently are licensed to conduct business in  states the exception being new york and in the district of columbia and the virgin islands state insurance laws generally provide regulators with broad powers related to issuing licenses to transact business regulating marketing and other trade practices operating guaranty associations regulating certain premium rates regulating insurance holding company systems establishing reserve requirements prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and reports performing financial and other examinations determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus regulating the type and amount of investments permitted limiting the amount of dividends that can be paid and the size of transactions that can be consummated without first obtaining regulatory approval and other related matters the regulators also make periodic examinations of individual companies and review annual and other reports on the financial conditions of all companies operating within their respective jurisdictions keyport and independence life prepare their statutorybasis financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of rhode island keyport benefit prepares its statutorybasis financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the new york department of insurance state laws prescribe certain statutory accounting practices permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices that are not proscribed such practices may differ between the states and companies within a state the national association of insurance commissioners the naic currently is in the process of codifying statutory accounting practices the result of which is expected to constitute the only source of prescribed statutory accounting practices that project which is expected to be completed in  may result in changes to the accounting practices that the company uses to prepare its statutorybasis financial statements the impact of any such changes on the companys statutorysurplus cannot be determined at this time no assurance can be given that such changes would not have a material adverse effect on the company riskbased capital requirements in recent years various states have adopted new quantitative standards promulgated by the naic these standards are designed to reduce the risk of insurance company insolvencies in part by providing an early warning of financial or other difficulties these standards include the naics riskbased capital rbc requirements rbc requirements attempt to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in a companys mix of products and investment portfolio the requirements provide for four different levels of regulatory attention which implement increasing levels of regulatory control ranging from development of an action plan to mandatory receivership as of december   keyports capital and surplus exceeded the level at which the least severe of these regulatory attention levels would be triggered guaranty fund assessments under the insurance guaranty fund laws existing in each state insurers can be assessed for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants because assessments typically are not made for several years after an insurer fails keyport cannot accurately determine the precise amount or timing of its exposure to known insurance company insolvencies at this time for certain information regarding the companys historical and estimated future assessments see note  to the companys consolidated financial statements the insolvency of large life insurance companies in future years could result in material assessments to keyport by state guaranty funds no assurance can be given that such assessments would not have a material adverse effect on the company insurance holding company regulation current rhode island insurance law permits the payment of dividends or distributions from the company to liberty financial which together with dividends and distributions paid during the preceding  months do not exceed the lesser of i  of statutory surplus as of the preceding december  or ii the net gain from operations for the preceding fiscal year any proposed dividend in excess of this amount is called an extraordinary dividend and may not be paid until it is approved by the commissioner of insurance of the state of rhode island the company had not paid any dividends since its acquisition in  in  the company paid  million in dividends to liberty financial as of december   the amount of additional dividends that the company could pay without such approval was  million general regulation at federal level and certain related matters although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways current and proposed federal measures that may significantly affect the insurance business include limitations on antitrust immunity minimum solvency requirements and the removal of barriers restricting banks from engaging in the insurance business in particular several proposals to repeal or modify the bank holding company act of  which prohibits banks from being affiliated with insurance companies have been made by members of congress and the clinton administration moreover the united states supreme court held in  in nationsbank of north carolina v variable annuity life insurance company that annuities are not insurance for purposes of the national bank act in addition the supreme court also held in  in barnett bank of marion city v nelson that state laws prohibiting national banks from selling insurance in small town locations are preempted by federal law the office of the comptroller of the currency adopted a ruling in november  that permits national banks under certain circumstances to expand into other financial services thereby increasing competition for the company at present the extent to which banks can sell insurance and annuities without regulation by state insurance departments is being litigated in various courts in the united states although the effect of these recent developments on the company and its competitors is uncertain there can be no assurance that such developments would not have a material adverse effect on the company competition the companys business activities are conducted in extremely competitive markets keyport competes with a large number of life insurance companies some of which are larger and more highly capitalized and have higher ratings than keyport no one company dominates the industry in addition keyports products compete with alternative investment vehicles available through financial institutions brokerage firms and investment managers management believes that keyport competes principally with respect to product features pricing ratings and service management also believes that keyport can continue to compete successfully in this market by offering innovative products and superior services in addition financial institutions and brokerdealers focus on the insurers ratings for financial strength or claimspaying ability in determining whether to market the insurers annuities employees as of december   the company had  fulltime employees the company

you and received at our office summary of certificate features this summary and the detailed information in this prospectus describe participating interests in group and individual deferred annuity contracts and the certificates issued thereunder we offer the certificates to assist you in your retirement planning the certificate the certificate is designed to provide retirement benefits for eligible individuals eligible individuals include persons participating in certain trusts or plans and may include employees of an employer certain states however do not permit us to issue certificates and require us to issue individual contracts instead we issue allocated and nonallocated certificates under group contracts with allocated certificates each individuals interest is separately accounted for and is held in a specific account established for that individual we will issue an allocated certificate to each participant in a nonqualified plan and in certain qualified plans which will verify participation in a group contract in such cases the participant will have a  vested interest in all values credited to the individual participants account with nonallocated certificates however a participants interest may be vested in the plan in which they are participating rather than in a certificate we will only issue nonallocated certificates in connection with certain qualified plans in such cases the certificate will usually be owned by the trustees of the plan and a single account will be established and held on behalf of all participants in the plan on a nonallocated basis single premium we require a single premium of at least  per account to accompany the application or the enrollment form for an allocated certificate a single premium of  or more requires our approval the single premium does not need to accompany the enrollment form under a group contract the single premium is the only premium payment that we permit or require but you may purchase more than one certificate see enrollment form and premium payments page  you may allocate the single premium to one of two types of accounts the interest account or the indexed account of varying durations or terms certain states however do not permit indexed accounts to be available for certificates issued in those states investments by keyport the single premium that is credited to your account becomes part of our assets we own our general account and separate account assets and generally invest these amounts in us government securities and certain commercial debt securities having maturities that usually match the terms we may also invest our assets in various instruments including equity options futures forwards and other instruments based on the index to hedge our obligations with respect to indexed accounts we may also buy and sell interest rate swaps and caps treasury bond futures and similar instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates see investments by keyport page  interest earned on accounts interest accounts earn interest at a fixed rate that we set and guarantee at the beginning of the term for the duration of the term we credit such guaranteed interest rates to interest accounts on an annual compounded basis for the entire duration of the selected term this means that we add interest to the amount invested so that credited interest may earn interest see interest accounts page  interest credited to indexed accounts or index increase is calculated by reference to fixed interest rate factors which are applied to changes in the standard  poors  composite stock price index using a formula set forth in the certificate we set and guarantee guaranteed interest rate factors at the beginning of a term for the duration of the term if the publication of the index is discontinued or there is a substantial change in the calculation of the index we will substitute a suitable index index increases are based on a percentage of the percentage increase in the index since the beginning of the term index increases are calculated using the guaranteed interest rate factors set at the beginning of the term and credited proportionately over the selected term on each account anniversary index increases are subject to a maximum and minimum limit both of which we set and guarantee at the beginning of the term the minimum may not be less than zero thus the indexed account value will not decrease to reflect declines in the index value since the beginning of the term or from account anniversary to account anniversary see indexed accounts page  the amount of index increases earned on an indexed account may be more or less than the amount of interest earned on an interest account of the same term and established at the same time it is possible that an indexed account will not earn index increases on account anniversaries if the index value on any of the account anniversaries in the term does not exceed its value at the beginning of the term see establishment of guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors page  in certain circumstances the certificate permits a minimum value to be used instead of the indexed account value to calculate benefits under a certificate this value or the certificate value is equal to o  of the single premium o plus any excess interest credits o less any amounts you have withdrawn in a partial surrender such amounts being reduced by any surrender charge o plus if the account value has ever been transferred a positive or negative amount reflecting the effect of any market value adjustment on the account value at the time of the transfer o plus interest credited on the foregoing at an annual guaranteed rate of  per year the amount used to calculate death benefits withdrawal amounts and annuity values will not be less than the certificate value subject to any market value adjustment on the corresponding account value if the indexed account value is less than the certificate value at the end of a term we will credit interest to the indexed account so that its value will equal the certificate value see certificate value page  indexed accounts page  terms and renewal of terms we currently offer initial terms of one three five six seven and ten interest account only years from time to time we may discontinue offering terms of certain durations or offer terms of other durations the interest rates and interest rate factors we declare may vary depending on the duration of the term you should contact us to determine the terms we currently offer you may transfer from one type of account to the other andor to terms of different durations subject to contractual provisions and any surrender charge and market value adjustment at the end of each term a new term of one year will begin unless you instruct us otherwise within  days before the end of the term at that time you may choose another term from among the terms we then offer or transfer the account value to the other type of account see renewal terms page  determinations of guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors we consider a variety of factors in setting guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors for any term these factors include the interest rates generally available on the types of instruments in which we invest your single premium the duration of the term regulatory and tax requirements sales commissions and expenses we bear general economic trends and competitive factors partial and total surrenders you may obtain a portion or all of your account value by making a partial or total surrender subject to certain restrictions such surrenders may be subject to a surrender charge andor a market value adjustment generally we deduct a surrender charge from any partial or total surrender made before the end of a term however we will not deduct a surrender charge from the following o a partial or total surrender within the first  calendar days after the end of any term if you notify us in writing before the surrender Â  Â  o the free withdrawal amount of the first partial surrender in a particular certificate year however any partial surrender amount above the free withdrawal amount or any subsequent partial surrender during the same certificate year will be subject to a surrender charge Â  Â  o the free withdrawal amount of a total surrender if no partial surrender was made in the same certificate year otherwise the total amount surrendered is subject to a surrender charge see surrender charge page  Â  Â  o the withdrawal of interest earnings from an interest account pursuant to our systematic withdrawal program systematic withdrawals may not be made from an indexed account see systematic withdrawal program page  the minimum partial surrender generally is  the minimum for partial surrenders under our systematic withdrawal program is  after a partial surrender the minimum account value must be at least  we do not permit partial surrenders from the indexed account of any certificate issued under a corporate or keogh qualified plan that is established pursuant to section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the surrender charge equals a percentage of the gross amount surrendered in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the addition or deduction of any market value adjustment the surrender charge percentage declines depending on the number of years rounded up remaining until the end of the term the maximum surrender charge currently is  for surrenders when seven or more years remain in the term we may defer payment of any partial or total surrender for up to six months from the date we receive your surrender request some states permit only a shorter deferral period a payment deferral for more than  days is unlikely to occur except under highly unusual circumstances see payment upon partial or total surrender page  transfers you may transfer the interest account value to another account at any time before the income date subject to certain conditions you may transfer the indexed account value only at the end of a term any amount you transfer before the end of a term may be subject to a market value adjustment presently we do not charge for transfers but we may institute a transfer charge on transfers in excess of a certain number of transfers annually see transfer of values page  market value adjustment page  market value adjustment the amount payable upon a partial or total surrender from or upon the application to an annuity option of account value of an account with a term of three years or more may be adjusted up or down by a market value adjustment the scaling factor is currently  which means there will be no reduction of any market value adjustment amount the market value adjustment is an amount that in certain circumstances we add or subtract from your account value to reflect the relative difference between o the current treasury rate for a period of time equivalent to the Â  remaining duration of the current term and o the treasury rate at the beginning of the term for a period of Â  time equal to the full duration of the term it is possible therefore that a significant increase in treasury rates from the beginning of a term would cause your total surrender amount to be less than the original amount credited to your account see market value adjustment page  a market value adjustment will not apply to a partial or total surrender within the first  calendar days after the end of any term with respect to another surrender or annuitization if a partial surrender has not occurred in the same certificate year we base the market value adjustment on the gross amount payable that is in excess of the free withdrawal amount before deducting any surrender charge otherwise we base the market value adjustment on the gross amount payable before deducting any surrender charge see market value adjustment page  a market value adjustment also applies to any transfer from an interest or indexed account with a term of three years or more unless the effective date of the transfer is o within the last year of the term and the transfer is to an account with a term of three years or more or Â  Â  o within the first  calendar days after the end of a term the market value adjustment upon transfer is based on the account value or if a partial surrender has not occurred in the same certificate year on the account value in excess of the free withdrawal amount see market value adjustment page  the market value adjustment for indexed accounts includes a scaling factor which may reduce the positive or negative amount of any such market value adjustment the scaling factor is currently  which means there will be no reduction of any market value adjustment amount the market value adjustment for interest accounts does not include a scaling factor see market value adjustment page  annuity period on the income date we will start to pay the designated annuitant a series of annuity payments under an annuity option the annuity option you select determines the timing and basis of the annuity payments see annuity period provisions page   death benefit the certificate provides for a special death benefit if you die before the income date if the certificate owner is not a natural person or the annuitant dies before the income date the designated beneficiary may claim the special death benefit by surrendering the certificate to us for the special death benefit the special death benefit is the greater of o the certificate value Â  Â  o the certificate withdrawal value or Â  Â  o the account value but if the term that includes the date of death relates to an indexed account and the terms floor is equal to  we may recalculate the account value and the new value will be the same or higher if the surrender request is made after the applicable  or  day period or upon the death of a joint certificate owner the designated beneficiary will receive the certificate withdrawal value if the designated beneficiary chooses not to surrender the certificate it may stay in force for up to five years after the date of death at the end of the five years we will pay the designated beneficiary the certificate withdrawal value without deducting any surrender charge see death provisions page  surrender charge page  premium taxes r we will deduct the amount of any premium taxes levied by any state or governmental entity when the premium tax is actually paid unless we defer the deduction until the time of surrender or the income date we cannot describe precisely the amount of premium tax you may have to pay on any transaction the amount of any premium tax charged to your certificate depends among other things on the type of certificate your state of residence the annuitants state of residence our status within those states and the insurance tax laws of those states currently premium tax rates range from  to  appendix c on page  of this prospectus contains a schedule of premium tax rates r annual reports to certificate owners at least once each certificate year we will send you a report which will show the account value the certificate withdrawal value the market value adjustment used to calculate the certificate withdrawal value and any surrender charge risk factors an inherent risk of the certificate is that if you make a partial or total surrender before the end of the applicable term application of any surrender charge andor market value adjustment might reduce the value of your account as a result you could receive less than your original single premium see surrender charge page  market value adjustment page  we base the interest and index increases earned by an account on the guaranteed interest rate and guaranteed interest rate factors that we declare at the beginning of each term the initial and subsequent guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors apply to the original principal sum and reinvested earnings our management will decide what guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors to declare we cannot predict or guarantee future guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors see establishment of guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors page  certificate ownership the certificate owner is the person or entity designated in the application or enrollment form for the certificate you may exercise all rights under the certificate joint certificate owners are permitted but not contingent certificate owners prior to the income date you and any joint certificate owner may direct us in writing to change the certificate owner joint certificate owner beneficiary contingent beneficiary contingent annuitant or in certain instances the annuitant you may change an irrevocablynamed person only with the written consent of that person because a change of certificate owner by means of a gift may be a taxable event you should consult a competent tax adviser about the tax consequences resulting from such a transfer qualified certificates may have limitations on the transfer of ownership you should consult a competent tax adviser about the tax consequences resulting from such a transfer enrollment form and single premium payments you must submit a single premium of at least  per certificate with the enrollment form for an allocated certificate we must

certificate and confirm the receipt of the single premium in writing if we issue a contract on a nonallocated basis a single account is opened for the contract owner your account starts earning interest the day after it is established you may choose to allocate the single premium to an interest account or an indexed account the indexed account is not available for certificates issued in certain states if we determine that an enrollment form is incomplete we will notify you in writing or by telephone to obtain the necessary information we will return an incomplete enrollment form along with the single premium if you do not complete it within three weeks of its receipt we will permit others to act on your behalf in certain instances including the following two examples first we will accept an application for a certificate that contains a signature signed under a power of attorney if a copy of the power of attorney is also submitted second we will also issue a certificate to replace an existing life insurance or annuity policy that was issued by us or an affiliated company without requiring a new application from the applicant certain dealers and other authorized persons

terms of one three five six seven and ten years however the tenyear term is only available on an interest account we may offer other terms from time to time the indexed account is not available for certificates issued in certain states a term begins on the date the single premium is allocated or an amount is transferred to an account and ends when the number of years in the term elected has elapsed the last day of the term is the expiration date for the term the subsequent term begins on the first day after the expiration date of the previous term the single premium less any surrenders and premium taxes earns and is credited interest andor index increases in accordance with the applicable formula for an account we credit interest to an interest account at the guaranteed interest rates that are specified at the beginning of the term for the duration of the term we credit index increases to indexed accounts by reference to guaranteed interest rate factors that are specified at the beginning of the term for the duration of the term interest accounts through the interest accounts we offer specified effective and guaranteed annual rates of interest for a specified period of time the term that you select guaranteed interest rates may differ among different terms or terms established at different times a guaranteed interest rate will not be less than  per year once we declare a guaranteed interest rate at the beginning of a term we will not change it during the term we will credit interest daily at a compounded rate which will be equal to the guaranteed interest rate if an amount remains in an interest account until the end of the applicable term its value will be equal to the amount originally allocated or transferred to the interest account less all amounts withdrawn plus all interest credited appendix a provides an example of how interest is credited to the interest account indexed accounts through the indexed accounts we offer index increases that depend on increases in a specified index index increases are determined based on a formula using specified guaranteed interest rate factors the participation rate cap and floor that are available for the terms you select guaranteed interest rate factors may differ among different terms or terms established at different times once these guaranteed interest rate factors are declared at the beginning of a term they will never be changed during the term index increases may be added to an indexed account on each account anniversary if an amount remains in an indexed account until the end of the applicable term its value will be equal to the amount originally allocated or transferred to the indexed account less all amounts withdrawn plus all index increases credited we will calculate and credit index increases on each account anniversary after the start of a term the certificate contains the formula for calculating the index increases we will credit index increases to the indexed account proportionately over the entire term therefore there are two components of the index increases calculated on each account anniversary the first part is the proportionate credit for any increase in the index from its prior highest account anniversary value to its new highest value on the current account anniversary the second part is the proportionate credit for any increase in the index occurring on a prior account anniversaryies the second part of the index increase will always be zero on the first account anniversary in any term o part one is calculated as follows multiply the participation rate by the percentage increase in the index from its prior highest account anniversary value to its current account anniversary value divided by its beginning of term value the result is then multiplied by the ratio of the number of completed account years in the term to the total number of account years in the term this percentage is then multiplied by the smaller of the account value at the beginning of the term and the account value prior to crediting any index increases on any account anniversary in the term Â  Â  o part two is calculated as follows multiply the participation rate by the percentage increase in the index since the beginning of the term calculated using the highest value attained by the index at any account anniversary during the term excluding the current account anniversary divide the resulting percentage by the number of account years in the term this percentage is then multiplied by the smaller of the account value at the beginning of the term and the account value prior to crediting any index increases on any account anniversary in the term part one and two amounts as calculated above may be reduced if the cap is applicable and increased if a floor in excess of zero is applicable the sum of the two parts equals the total index increase if the index on each account anniversary in a term is less than the index at the beginning of the term there will not be any index increases credited during the term index increases can never be negative because of the floor of zero the effect of this formula is that in the absence of any partial or total surrender during a term the total index increases credited during a term will equal o the account value at the beginning of the term o multiplied by the participation rate times the percentage increase in the index since the beginning of the term subject to the floor and cap using the highest value attained by the index on any account anniversary in the term  partial surrenders in excess of index increases will reduce the amount of subsequent index increases but do not affect index increases previously credited total index increases may be more or less than the amount of interest credited to an interest account established at the same time for the same term depending on the change in the index over the course of the term if no or small index increases are earned by an indexed account in time the value of an indexed account may be less than the certificate value in such a circumstance the certificate value is used to calculate any benefit payable under the certificate if at the end of a term the value of an indexed account is less than the certificate value we will credit the indexed account with an end of the term increase that is equal to the excess of the certificate value over the indexed account value see certificate value page  currently the index is the standard  poors  composite stock price index sp  the sp  is a widelyaccepted and broad

notify us in writing within  days before the end of a term of your selection of a different term or transfer the account value to a different type of account you may choose from among the terms we offer at that time we may discontinue offering terms of certain durations currently available or offer terms of different durations from time to time the available guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors may vary based on the duration of the term selected and may differ from the rates currently available for new certificates you may not select a term that is longer than the number of years remaining until the income date if you do we will allocate the account value to a term of one year if less than one year remains until the income date we automatically will allocate the account value to an interest account with a term of one year the account value at the beginning of any subsequent term will be equal to the account value at the end of the previous term absent any partial or total surrender or transfer the effects of which are described below the account value will earn and be credited with interest or index increases for each year in the subsequent term using the guaranteed interest rates or guaranteed interest rate factors established at the beginning of the subsequent term for the type of account and term selected by you or established by default as described above in the absence of other instructions information on renewal rates we will provide you with a tollfree number to call to inquire about rates for terms offered at the time we will notify you in writing of the available terms before the beginning of each subsequent term establishment of guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors you will know the guaranteed interest rate or guaranteed interest rate factors for the chosen term at the time of the initial purchase guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors may differ among the terms we may offer differing guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors for initial allocations transfers during terms and renewal terms we do not have a specific formula for determining future guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors the guaranteed rates and factors will reflect interest rates available on the types of investments in which we invest the proceeds of the account see investments by keyport page  our management may also consider various other factors to determine guaranteed rates and factors for a term such as the duration of a term regulatory and tax requirements sales commissions and administrative expenses we bear general economic trends and competitive factors the guaranteed interest rates we declare and the rate of interest we credit to the certificate value used in the determination of an indexed account value however will never be less than  annually our management will make the final determination as to guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors to be declared we cannot predict or guarantee future guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors certificate value the certificate provides a minimum value called the certificate value that we use to calculate benefits under a certificate when the certificate value is higher than the value of an indexed account calculated as described above the certificate value is equal to o  of the single premium Â  Â  o plus any excess interest credits Â  Â  o less all amounts you have withdrawn in a partial surrender including any applicable surrender charges Â  Â  o plus if a market value adjustment was applied to a transfer the positive or negative amount equal to the adjusted certificate valuewhich is the certificate value adjusted in proportion to the effect of the market value adjustment on the account value less the certificate value at the time of the transfer Â  Â  o plus interest credited at an annual guaranteed rate of  per year in addition at each account anniversary and at the time of a transfer we will credit additional interest called an excess interest credit to the certificate value to the extent needed to ensure that the total interest including previous excess interest credits credited to the certificate value equals the total interest or index increases ever credited to your account value interest amounts credited to the certificate value will earn interest in subsequent certificate years the certificate value is used to calculate benefits if for example the index were to remain level or decline for several years and accordingly index increases were not credited to an indexed account in such a circumstance while the value of the indexed account would not decline the certificate value might rise above the value of the indexed account as a result of the  annual interest credited to certificate value transfer of values you may transfer the entire account value from an interest or indexed account to another interest or indexed account subject to the following limitations o the transfer must be by written request or telephone before the income date Â  Â  o you may not exceed any limit we may set currently we do not limit the number of transfers in a certificate year Â  Â  o you may transfer the indexed account value only during the first  calendar days after the end of each full term Â  Â  o you may transfer the interest account value at any time before the income date Â  Â  o the amount transferred shall equal the total account value with any market value adjustment partial transfers are not permitted Â  Â  o no market value adjustment shall apply to a transfer Â  Â  Â  i from an account with a term of less than three years Â  ii in the final year of a term of three or more years to an account with a term of three or more years or Â  iii within the first  calendar days after the end of each full term and Â  Â  Â  o for transfers not made within the first  calendar days of a term the term of the new account cannot be less than the remaining number of account years rounded up in the existing term and Â  Â  o the term of the new account cannot be longer than the number of years remaining until the income date while currently transfers are free of charge we reserve the right to charge  per transfer if you make more than four transfers in a certificate year we reserve the right at any time and without prior notice to terminate modify or suspend the transfer privileges described above surrenders you may make a full or partial surrender of your account at any time prior to the income date while the certificate is in force partial surrenders are subject to the following charges and conditions o the surrender is at least  unless it is made pursuant to our systematic withdrawal plan in which case the minimum is  and Â  Â  o the remaining account value after the partial surrender is at least  we reserve the right to change the minimum amount of any partial surrender we do not allow partial surrenders from the indexed account of any certificate issued under a corporate or keogh qualified plan under section  of the internal revenue code the net amount of a partial or total surrender will include deductions for any surrender charge and market value adjustment the amount you receive may be greater or less than the amount subtracted from the account value as a result of the surrender as described below certain partial surrenders are not subject to a surrender charge andor market value adjustment if a request for a partial surrender would create insufficient account value to keep the certificate in force we will treat the request as a request to surrender only the excess amount over  we will upon request inform you of the amount payable upon a full or partial surrender any total or partial surrender may be subject to tax in addition to certain certificate charges and adjustments see tax considerations page  a systematic withdrawal program to the extent permitted by law we will make monthly quarterly semiannual or annual distributions of interest credited to an interest account if you have enrolled in the systematic withdrawal program all interest distributions are made directly to you and are taxed like any other withdrawal or distribution of account value see tax considerations page  the minimum withdrawal may not be less than  you may not take systematic withdrawals from an indexed account distributions under the systematic withdrawal program are not subject to surrender charges or market value adjustments b partial surrender procedures and determination of surrender value at any time before the income date you may in writing request a partial surrender the surrender amount paid to you will be the requested surrender amount increased or decreased by any market value adjustment and decreased by any surrender charge the surrender charge and the market value adjustment are calculated based on the requested surrender amount the requested surrender amount will be deducted from your account value for example if you request a surrender amount of  the surrender charge and the market value adjustment were each  and the free withdrawal amount did not apply the surrender charge and the market value adjustment would each be  of  for a net surrender payment to you of   we may in our discretion allow you to request the net partial surrender amount that you wish to be paid instead of the surrender amount described in the prior paragraph if a market value adjustment applies however the amount we actually pay may be more or less than the amount requested because of computational rounding the total amount deducted from the account value upon a partial surrender will be the surrender amount prior to the application of any market value adjustment and any applicable surrender charge that we calculate based on your requested net amount for example if you request a net partial surrender amount of  under the assumptions in the example above the total amount calculated by us and deducted from your account would be approximately  c total surrender procedures and determination of surrender value you may make a total surrender by written request surrendering the certificate will end it the surrender value will be determined as of the date we receive the written request for surrender we will pay you the certificate withdrawal value which is the greater of i the account value with any market value adjustment and less any surrender charge and ii the certificate value adjusted by the ratio of the account value with any market value adjustment to the unadjusted account value we will deduct any premium taxes not previously paid for any total surrender made after the first certificate year you may receive the surrender benefit under an annuity option rather than in a lump sum d risk the interest and index increases credited to your account are based on guarantees we make the initial and subsequent guaranteed interest rates and guaranteed interest rate factors apply to the original principal sum and reinvested earnings an inherent risk in a surrender prior to the end of the applicable term is that the market value adjustment may reduce your account value see market value adjustment page  e payment upon partial or total surrender we may defer payment of any partial or total surrender for six months or less from the date of receipt of your request for surrender it is unlikely that we would defer a surrender payment more than  days deferred payment may be caused by an unusually high number of surrender requests accompanied by a substantial shift in interest rates if we decide to defer payment for more than  days we will notify you in writing deductions a surrender charge we do not deduct a sales charge from the single premium when we receive it a surrender charge is deducted upon any partial or total surrender except o a partial or total surrender within the first  calendar days after the end of any full term or during the certificate year preceding the income date Â  Â  o the portion of the first partial surrender in each certificate year that does not exceed the free withdrawal amount Â  Â  o as to total surrenders the portion of the gross surrender amount that does not exceed the free withdrawal amount if no partial surrender was made in the same certificate year the amount of any surrender charge is computed as a percentage of the gross surrender amount in excess of the free withdrawal amount the percentage used depends on the number of account years rounded up remaining until the end of the account term the surrender charge is equal to i the amount of the partial surrender request less any free withdrawal amount Â  Â  ii multiplied by the applicable percentage from the certificate schedule depending on the number of account years rounded up remaining until the end of the term the following chart indicates the surrender charge percentage that will be applied while the specified number of years are remaining term length in years account years remaining                                Â

or decrease the amount of this charge and the period of time for which it will apply on new certificates up to a maximum of  and  years currently the charge is  if such amounts increase the increase will only apply to new certificates issued after full disclosure to new certificate owners or to existing certificate owners purchasing additional certificates after each surrender we will adjust our records to reflect appropriate deductions from the account value and the certificate value the surrender charge will apply to a full or partial surrender in each term of a certificate any surrender may in addition to certain certificate charges and adjustments be subject to tax see tax considerations page  appendix b provides examples of how the surrender charge is determined b market value adjustment the amount payable upon a partial or total surrender before the income date a transfer or application of account value to an annuity option may be increased or decreased by the application of a market value adjustment the market value adjustment reflects the difference between i the current treasury rate for a period of time equivalent to the remaining duration of the current term and ii the treasury rate at the beginning of the term for a period equal to the full duration of the term a market value adjustment will not apply to a partial or total surrender or the transfer of account value to an annuity option within the first  calendar days after the end of a term a market value adjustment applies to any other partial or total surrender of or upon the transfer of account value to an annuity option from an account with a term of three years or more the market value adjustment calculation upon such a surrender may be based on the gross surrender amount before the deduction of any surrender charge a market value adjustment applies to any transfer from an account with a term of three years or more to another account unless the effective date of the transfer is i within the final account year of the term and the transfer is to an account with a term of three years or more or ii within the first  calendar days after the end of any term the market value adjustment calculation upon transfer may be based on the account value a market value adjustment in connection with a transfer also will result in an adjustment to certificate value see certificate value page  if you have not previously taken a partial surrender or effected any other transaction potentially subject to a market value adjustment in the same certificate year we subtract an amount not exceeding the free withdrawal amount from the amount used to calculate the market value adjustment otherwise we use the amount you requested to be surrendered transferred or applied to an annuity option as the basis to calculate the market value adjustment the market value adjustment for indexed accounts includes a scaling factor you will know the scaling factor for all indexed account terms at the time of the initial purchase scaling factors may differ for terms of different durations we may change the scaling factors from time to time for new certificates issued after the time of the change the scaling factors will never be greater than one where a scaling factor is less than one it will reduce the positive or negative amount of any market value adjustment the scaling factors are shown on the certificate schedule and are guaranteed for the life of the certificate the scaling factors are currently  the market value adjustment for interest accounts does not include a scaling factor because the market value adjustment is based on changes in the yields on us treasury securities the effect of the market value adjustment will be closely related to the levels of such yields as a result should such yields increase significantly from the time of purchase of a certificate coupled with any surrender charge the amount you would receive upon a total surrender could be less than the single premium appendix b provides the formula for calculating the market value adjustment as well as illustrative examples at your request we will furnish you with illustrations of the market value adjustment on your account value if you make a total or partial surrender before the end of a term c premium taxes we will deduct the amount of any premium taxes levied by a state or governmental entity when the premium tax is incurred unless we defer the deduction until the time of surrender or the income date the amount of premium tax payable on any transaction involving a certificate will vary depending on whether the certificate is qualified or nonqualified your state of residence the state of residence of the annuitant our status within such states and the insurance tax laws of such states currently premium tax rates range from  to  appendix c contains a schedule of premium tax rates death provisions death provisions do not apply to nonallocated certificates with

noncertificate owner annuitants if while the certificate is in force you or any joint certificate owner dies or if the annuitant dies when an entity such as a trust owns the certificate we will treat the designated beneficiary as the certificate owner after such a death the designated beneficiary will be the first person among the following who is alive on the date of death you joint certificate owner primary beneficiary contingent beneficiary and otherwise your estate if you and joint certificate owner are both alive you will be the designated beneficiary together the designated beneficiary may receive a death benefit by surrendering the account if the decedent was you or the annuitant if the certificate owner is not a natural person and the surrender occurs by the later of the th day after the death or the th day after we are notified of the death the death benefit is the greatest of the following three values if the decedent was you or the annuitant if the certificate owner is an entity the designated beneficiary may by the later of the th day after the death and the th day after we are notified of the death surrender the account for the death benefit on the date of surrender the death benefit is the greatest of the following three values i the certificate value Â  Â  ii the certificate withdrawal value or Â  Â  iii the account value but if the term in which death occurs relates to an indexed account and the terms floor is  the account value is Â  a the indexed account value at the start of the account year in which death occurs except that if death occurs in the last

annuitant b qualified certificates death of annuitant if the annuitant dies while the certificate is in force the designated beneficiary will control the certificate the designated beneficiary has until the later of the th day after the death and the th day after we are notified of the death to surrender the certificate for the death benefit the death benefit is o the certificate value Â  Â  o the certificate withdrawal value or Â  Â  o your account value but if the term in which death occurs relates to an indexed account and the terms floor is  the account value is Â  Â  Â  a the indexed account value at the start of the account year in which death occurs except that if death occurs in the last account year of the term and the designated beneficiarys surrender occurs after the end of that term the indexed account value at the end of a term is used instead Â  Â  Â  Â  b minus the sum of any partial surrenders since the start of the account year in which death occurs if a surrender is after the applicable  or  day period the death benefit is the certificate withdrawal value if the designated beneficiary does not surrender the certificate the certificate may continue for the period permitted by the internal revenue code during this period the designated beneficiary may exercise all ownership rights including the right to make partial or total surrenders if the certificate is in effect at the end of the period we will automatically end it then by paying to the designated beneficiary the certificate withdrawal value if the designated beneficiary is not alive we will pay any persons named by the designated beneficiary in writing otherwise we will pay the designated beneficiarys estate payment of benefits  instead of receiving a lump sum you or any designated beneficiary may direct us in writing to pay any benefit or  or more under an annuity option that meets the following o the first payment to the designated beneficiary must be made no later than one

consequences regarding the purchase of a contract or certificate cannot be made in this prospectus special tax rules may apply with respect to certain purchase situations not discussed herein we do not consider any applicable state or other tax laws for detailed information you should always consult a competent tax adviser this discussion is based upon our understanding of federal income tax laws as they are currently interpreted the united states congress has in the past and may in the future consider legislation that if enacted could adversely affect the tax treatment of annuity contracts including distributions and undistributed appreciation there is no way to predict whether when or in what form congress will enact legislation affecting annuity contracts any such legislation could have retroactive effect regardless of the date of enactment we are not making any representation regarding the likelihood of continuation of those current federal income tax laws or of the current interpretations by the internal revenue service taxation of keyport we are taxed as a life insurance company under part i of subchapter l of the internal revenue code of  as amended code we own assets underlying the certificates and any income earned on those assets will be deemed our income taxation of annuities section  of the code governs the taxation of annuities you a trust or other entity holding a nonqualified certificate as an agent for an individual are not taxed on increases in account value until a distribution occurs in the form of a total or partial surrender an assignment or gift of the certificate or annuity payments the provisions of section  of the code concerning distributions are briefly summarized below a trust or other entity owning a nonqualified certificate other than as an agent for an individual is taxed differently increases in account value are taxed yearly whether or not a distribution occurs a surrenders death benefit payments assignments and gifts if you fully surrender your certificate the portion of the payment that exceeds your cost basis in the certificate is subject to tax for nonqualified certificates the cost basis is generally the amount of the single premium and the taxable portion of the surrender payment is subject to tax as ordinary income for qualified certificates the cost basis is generally zero and the taxable portion of the surrender payment is generally taxed as ordinary income a designated beneficiary receiving a lump sum surrender benefit after your death or the death of the annuitant is similarly taxed on the portion of the amount that exceeds your cost basis in the certificate if the designated beneficiary elects to receive annuity payments that begin within one year of the decedents death different tax rules apply see annuity payments below partial surrenders received under nonqualified certificates prior to the income date are first included in gross income to the extent the account value plus or minus any market value adjustment exceeds the single premium to the extent the account value plus or minus any market value adjustment does not exceed the single premium such surrenders are treated as a nontaxable return of principal to you for partial surrenders under a qualified certificate payments are treated first as a nontaxable return of principal up to the cost basis and then a taxable return of income since the cost basis of qualified certificates is generally zero partial surrender amounts will generally be fully taxed as ordinary income if you assign or pledge a nonqualified certificate you will be treated as if you have received the amount assigned or pledged you will be subject to taxation under the rules applicable to surrenders if you give away the certificate to anyone other than your spouse you will be treated for income tax purposes as if you have fully surrendered the certificate a special computational rule applies if during any calendar year we issue to you more than one certificate or one or more certificates and one or more of our other annuity contracts under this rule the amount of any distribution includable in your gross income is determined under section e of the code all such contracts will be treated as one contract we believe that this means the amount of any distribution under any certificate will be includable in gross income to the extent that at the time of distribution the sum of the values for all the certificates or contracts exceeds the sum of the cost bases for all the contracts this special computational rule applies to laddered certificates which are multiple certificates of different terms that are purchased during one calendar year b annuity payments we determine the nontaxable portion of each annuity payment with an exclusion ratio formula which establishes the ratio that the cost basis of the certificate bears to the total expected value of annuity payments for the term of the annuity the remaining portion of each payment is taxable at ordinary income rates for qualified certificates the cost basis is generally zero with annuity payments based on life contingencies the payments will become fully taxable once the payee lives longer than the life expectancy used to calculate the nontaxable portion of the prior payments c penalty tax payments received by you annuitants and designated beneficiaries under the certificates may be subject to both ordinary income taxes and a penalty tax equal to  of the amount received that is includable in income the penalty tax is not imposed on amounts received under the following circumstances o after the taxpayer attains age  Â  Â  o in a series of substantially equal payments made for life or life expectancy Â  Â  o after your death or where an entity owns the certificate after the death of the annuitant Â  Â  o if the taxpayer becomes totally and permanently disabled or Â  Â  o under a nonqualified certificates annuity payment option that provides for a series of substantially equal payments provided the certificate is not issued as a result of a section  exchange and the first annuity payment begins in the first certificate year d income tax withholding we are required to withhold federal income taxes on taxable amounts paid under the certificates unless the recipient elects not to have withholding apply we will notify recipients of their right to elect not to have withholding apply see taxsheltered annuities tsas below for an alternative type of withholding that may apply to distributions from tsas that are eligible for rollover to another tsa or an individual retirement annuity or account ira e section  exchanges you may purchase a nonqualified certificate with proceeds from the surrender of an existing annuity contract such a transaction may qualify as a taxfree exchange pursuant to section  of the code it is our understanding that in such an event o the new certificate is subject to the distributionatdeath rules described in death provisions for nonqualified certificates Â  Â  o purchase payments made between  and  and the income allocable to them will following an exchange no longer be covered by a grandfathered exception to the penalty tax for a distribution of income that is allocable to an investment made over ten years prior to the distribution and Â  Â  o purchase payments made before  and the income allocable to them will following an exchange continue to receive the following grandfathered tax treatment under prior law Â  Â  Â  Â  a the penalty tax does not apply to any distribution Â  Â  Â  Â  b partial surrenders are treated first as a nontaxable return of principal and then a taxable return of income and Â  Â  Â  Â  c assignments are not treated as surrenders subject to taxation our understanding of the above is principally based on legislative reports prepared by the staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation qualified plans the certificate may be used with several types of qualified plans the tax rules applicable to participants in such qualified plans vary according to the type of plan and the terms and conditions of the plan therefore we do not attempt to provide more than general information about the use of the certificate with the various types of qualified plans participants under such qualified plans as well as certificate owners annuitants and designated beneficiaries are cautioned that the rights of any person to any benefits under such qualified plans may be subject to the terms and conditions of the plans themselves regardless of the terms and conditions of the certificate issued in connection therewith following are brief descriptions of the various types of qualified plans and the use of the certificate in connection therewith purchasers of the certificate should seek competent advice concerning the terms and conditions of the particular qualified plan and use of the certificate with that plan taxsheltered annuities section b of the code permits public school employees and employees of certain types of charitable educational and scientific organizations specified in section c of the code to purchase annuity contracts and subject to certain contribution limitations exclude the amount of premium payments from gross income such premium payments may be subject to social security fica taxes this type of annuity contract is commonly referred to as a taxsheltered annuity section b of the code contains distribution restrictions specifically benefits may be paid through surrender of the certificate or otherwise only in the following circumstances o when the employee attains age  separates from service dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of section m of the code or Â  Â  o in the case of hardship a hardship distribution must be of employee contributions only and not of any income attributable to such contributions section b does not apply to distributions attributable to assets held as of december   thus it appears that the legal restrictions apply only to distributions attributable to contributions made after  to earnings on those contributions and to earnings on amounts held as of december   the internal revenue service has indicated that the distribution restrictions of section b are not applicable when tsa funds are being transferred taxfree directly to another tsa issuer provided the transferred funds continue to be subject to the section b distribution restrictions if you request a distribution from a certificate we will notify you if all or part of such distribution is eligible for rollover to another tsa or to an ira any amount eligible for rollover treatment will be subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding at a  rate unless you direct us in writing to transfer the amount as a direct rollover to another tsa or ira individual retirement annuities sections b and a of the code permit eligible individuals to contribute to an individual retirement program known as an individual retirement annuity and roth ira respectively these individual retirement annuities are subject to limitations on the amount which may be contributed the persons who may be eligible to contribute and on the time when distributions may commence in addition distributions from certain types of qualified plans may be placed on a taxdeferred basis into a section b individual retirement annuity corporate pension and profitsharing plans sections a and a of the code permit corporate employers to establish various types of retirement plans for employees such retirement plans may permit the purchase of the certificate to provide benefits under the plans annuity purchases by nonresident aliens

billion and  billion at december   and  respectively our general investment policy is to hold fixed maturity investments for longterm investment and accordingly we do not have a trading portfolio to provide for maximum portfolio flexibility and appropriate tax planning we classify our entire fixed maturity portfolio as available for sale and carries such investments at fair value gross unrealized losses at december   and  were  million and  million respectively approximately  billion or  of our general account and certain separate account investments at december   were rated by standard  poors corporation moodys investors service or under comparable statutory rating guidelines established by the naic at december   the carrying value of investments in below investment grade securities totaled  billion or  of general account and certain separate account investments of  billion below investment grade securities generally provide higher yields and involve greater risks than investment grade securities because their issuers typically are more highly leveraged and more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than investment grade issuers in addition the trading market for these securities may be more limited than for investment grade securities we routinely review our portfolio of investment securities we identify any investments that require additional monitoring on a monthly basis and carefully review the carrying value of such investments at least quarterly to determine whether specific investments should be placed on a nonaccrual basis and to determine declines in value that may be other than temporary in making these reviews we principally consider the adequacy of collateral if any compliance with contractual covenants the borrowers recent financial performance news reports and other externally generated information concerning the creditors affairs in the case of publicly traded investments management also considers market value quotations if available as of december   and  the carrying value of fixed maturity investments that were nonincome producing was  million and  million respectively which constitutes  of general account and certain separate account investments  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk marketsensitive instruments and risk management market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices the active management of market risk is integral to our operations we may use the following approaches to manage our exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges rebalance our existing asset or liability portfolios change the character of future investment purchases or use derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased corporate oversight we generate substantial investable funds from our annuity operations we believe that our fixed and indexed policyholder balances should be backed by investments principally comprised of fixed maturities which generate predictable rates of return we do not have a specific target rate of return instead our rates of return vary over time depending on the current interest rates the slope of the yield curve and the excess at which fixed maturities are priced over the yield curve our portfolio strategy is designed to achieve acceptable riskadjusted returns by effectively managing portfolio liquidity and credit quality we administer and oversee the investment risk management processes primarily through our investment committee our board of directors and the board of directors of liberty financial the investment committee and board of directors provide executive oversight of investment activities the investment committee is a senior management committee consisting of the chief investment officer chief financial officer president chief operating officer and members of senior management of liberty financial the investment committee meets monthly to provide detailed oversight of investment risk including market risk we have investment guidelines that define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks including the accountabilities and controls over these activities in addition we have specific investment policies that delineate the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given our liquidity surplus product and regulatory requirements we monitor and manage our exposure to market risk through asset allocation limits duration limits and stress tests asset allocation limits place restrictions on the aggregate fair value which may be invested within an asset class duration limits on the aggregate investment portfolio and as appropriate on individual components of the portfolio place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken stress tests measure downside risk to fair value and earnings over longer time intervals and for adverse market scenarios the daytoday management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by asset allocation duration and other limits including but not limited to credit and liquidity interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates this risk arises from our primary activities as we invest substantial funds in interestsensitive assets and also have interestsensitive liabilities our assetliability management emphasizes a conservative approach which is oriented toward reducing downside risk in adverse markets as opposed to maximizing spread in favorable markets we manage the interest rate risk inherent in our assets relative to the interest rate risk inherent in our liabilities one of the measures we use to quantify this exposure is effective duration effective duration is a common measure for the price sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates it measures the approximate percentage change in the fair value of assets and liabilities when interest rates change by  basis points this measure includes the impact of estimated changes in portfolio cash flows from features such as prepayments and bond calls the effective duration of assets and related liabilities are produced using standard financial valuation techniques at december   and  the estimated difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately  and  respectively this positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is somewhat more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities we seek to invest premiums and deposits to create future cash flows that will fund future benefits claims and expenses and earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios in order to achieve this objective and limit our exposure to interest rate risk we adhere to a philosophy of managing the effective duration of assets and related liabilities we use interest rate swaps futures and caps to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from effective duration mismatches between assets and liabilities to the extent that actual results differ from the assumptions utilized our effective duration could be significantly impacted important assumptions include the timing of cash flows on mortgagerelated assets and liabilities subject to policyholder surrenders additionally our calculation assumes that the current relationship between shortterm and longterm interest rates the term structure of interest rates will remain constant over time as a result these calculations may not fully capture the impact of nonparallel changes in the term structure of interest rates andor large changes in interest rates our potential exposure due to a  increase in prevailing interest rates from december   and  levels was a loss of  million and  million respectively in fair value of our fixedrate assets that were not offset by a decrease in the fair value of our fixedrate liabilities the decrease in potential exposure is primarily due to higher prevailing market interest rates and the decrease in positive duration gap we expect that our exposure to loss as interest rate changes occur will be minimized and that actual losses will be less than the estimated potential loss due to the combination of assetliability management strategies and flexibility in adjusting crediting rate levels equity price risk equity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in a particular stock or stock index at december   and  we had approximately  million and  million respectively in common stocks and  million and  million respectively in call options at december   and  we had  billion and  billion respectively in equityindexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with contractually guaranteed participation in price appreciation of the standard  poors  composite price index sp  index we purchase equityindexed options and futures to hedge the risk associated with the price appreciation component of equityindexed annuity liabilities we manage the equity risk inherent in our assets relative to the equity risk inherent in our liabilities by conducting detailed computer simulations that model our sp  index derivatives and our equityindexed annuity liabilities under stresstest scenarios in which both the index level and the index option implied volatility are varied through a wide range implied volatility is a value derived from standard option valuation models representing an implicit forecast of the standard deviation of the returns on the underlying asset over the life of the option or future the fair values of sp  index linked securities derivatives and annuities are produced using standard derivative valuation techniques the derivative portfolios are constructed to maintain acceptable interest margins under a variety of possible future sp  index levels and option or future cost environments in order to achieve this objective and limit our exposure to equity price risk we measure and manage these exposures using methods based on the fair value of assets and the price appreciation component of related liabilities we use derivatives including futures options and total return swaps to modify our net exposure to fluctuations in the sp  index based upon the information and assumptions we use in our stresstest scenarios at december   and  management estimates that if the sp  index increases by  the net fair value of our assets and liabilities described above would increase decrease by approximately  million and  million respectively if the sp  index decreases by  management estimates that the net fair value of our assets and liabilities will decrease by approximately  million and  million respectively if option implied volatilities increase by  basis points management estimates that the net fair value of its assets and liabilities will decrease by approximately  million and  million respectively the simulations do not consider the effects of other changes in market conditions that could accompany changes in the equity option and futures markets including the effects of changes in implied dividend yields interest rates and equityindexed annuity policy surrenders  derivatives as a component of our investment strategy and to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk we utilize interest rate and total return swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements to match assets more closely to liabilities interest rate swap agreements are agreements to exchange with counterparty interest rate payments of differing character eg fixedrate payments exchanged for variablerate payments based on an underlying principal balance notional principal to hedge against interest rate changes we currently utilize interest rate swap agreements to reduce asset duration and to better match interest earned on longerterm fixedrate assets with interest credited to policyholders a total return swap agreement is an agreement to exchange payments based upon an underlying notional balance and changes in variable rate and total return indices we utilize total return swap agreements to hedge our obligations related to certain separate account liabilities we had  and  outstanding swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of  billion and  billion as of december   and  respectively cap agreements are agreements with a counterparty that require the payment of a premium for the right to receive payments for the difference between the cap interest rate and a market interest rate on specified future dates based on an underlying principal balance notional principal to hedge against rising interest rates we had interest rate cap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of  million at december   we had no outstanding interest rate cap agreements as of december   with respect to our equityindexed annuities and certain separate account liabilities we buy call options futures and certain total return swap agreements on the sp  index to hedge our obligations to provide returns based upon this index we had total return swap agreements with a carrying value of  million and  million as of december   and  respectively there are risks associated with some of the techniques we use to match our assets and liabilities the primary risk associated with swap cap and call option agreements is counterparty nonperformance we believe that the counterparties to our swap cap and call option agreements are financially responsible and that the counterparty risk associated with these transactions is minimal future contracts trade on organized exchanges and therefore have minimal credit risk in addition swap and cap agreements have interest rate risk and call options futures and certain total return swap agreements have stock market risk these swap and cap agreements hedge fixedrate assets and we expect that any interest rate movements that adversely affect the market value of swap agreements would be offset by changes in the market values of such fixedrate assets however there can be no assurance that these hedges will be effective in offsetting the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates similarly the call options futures and certain total return swap agreements hedge our obligations to provide returns on equityindexed annuities and certain separate account liabilities based upon the sp  index and we believe that any stock market movements that adversely affect the market value of sp  index call options futures and certain total return swap agreements would be substantially offset by a reduction in policyholder and certain separate account liabilities however there can be no assurance that these hedges will be effective in offsetting the potentially adverse effects of changes in sp  index levels our profitability could be adversely affected if the value of our swap and cap agreements increase less than or decrease more than the change in the market value of our fixed rate assets andor if the value of its sp index  call options futures and certain total return swap agreements increase less than or decrease more than the value of the guarantees made to equityindexed and certain separate account policyholders in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in june  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no  this statement amended sfas no  to defer its effective date one year to fiscal years beginning after june   in june  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no  this statement makes certain changes in the hedging provisions of sfas no  and is effective concurrent with sfas no  collectively hereafter referred to as the statement the statement will require us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income if the derivative is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings upon adoption we will be required to record a cumulative effect adjustment to reflect this accounting change we estimate that the cumulative effect reported after tax and net of related effects of deferred policy acquisition costs upon adoption at january   will decrease net income and stockholders equity by approximately  million the adoption of the statement may increase volatility in reported income due to the requirement to mark all derivatives to fair value and the definition of an effective hedging relationship under the statement as opposed to certain hedges we believe are effective economic hedges we believe that we will continue to utilize our current risk management philosophy which includes the use of derivative instruments  liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs and financial resources pertain to the management of the general account assets and policyholder balances we use cash for the payment of annuity and life insurance benefits operating expenses policy acquisition costs and investment purchases we generate cash from annuity premiums deposits net investment income and from maturities and sales of our investments annuity premiums maturing investments and net investment income have historically been sufficient to meet our cash requirements we monitor cash and cash equivalents in an effort to maintain sufficient liquidity and have strategies in place to maintain sufficient liquidity in changing interest rate environments consistent with the nature of our obligations we have invested a substantial amount of our general account assets in readily marketable securities at december    billion or  of our general account investments are considered readily marketable to the extent that unanticipated surrenders cause us to sell for liquidity purposes a material amount of securities prior to their maturity such surrenders could have a material adverse effect on us although no assurance can be given we believe that liquidity to fund withdrawals would be available through incoming cash flow the sale of shortterm or floatingrate instruments thereby precluding the sale of fixed maturity investments in a potentially unfavorable market in addition our fixedrate products incorporate surrender charges to encourage persistency and make the cost of our policyholder balances more predictable approximately  of our fixed annuity policyholder balances were subject to surrender charges or restrictions at december   current rhode island insurance law permits us to pay dividends or distributions to liberty financial which together with dividends and distributions paid during the preceding  months do not exceed the lesser of i  of statutory surplus as of the preceding december  or ii the net gain from operations for the preceding fiscal year any proposed dividend in excess of this amount is called an extraordinary dividend and may not be paid until it is approved by the commissioner of insurance of the state of rhode island we paid  million  million and  million in dividends to liberty financial in   and  respectively we had not previously paid any dividends since our acquisition in  at december   the amount of additional dividends that we could pay without such approval was  million based upon our historical cash flow our current financial condition and our expectation that there will not be a material adverse change in the results of our operations and our subsidiaries during the next twelve months we believe that cash flow provided by operating activities over this period will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our liquidity needs  strategic review on november   our parent company announced that it has retained an investment banking firm to review its strategic alternatives including our possible sale to help retain our employees during the strategic review we implemented a special compensation plan that provides cash retention bonuses to substantially all employees we recorded a  million expense in  relating to this plan the retention bonuses are generally based on employees base salary andor target incentive compensation amounts except for sales personnel where retention bonuses are based on sales the estimated maximum cost of the retention bonuses assuming all covered employees remain with us is approximately  million with fifty percent payable on november   and the remainder payable on april   in the event of a change of our control that occurs prior to november   the payments would be accelerated and the retention bonus amount would be reduced subject to a minimum the estimated minimum retention bonus is approximately  million and would be recognized if a change of control occurs as of may   the amount of the retention bonus increases from the minimum on may   to the maximum on october   in calculating the  expense of  million a turnover rate of  was assumed  forwardlooking statements we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the reform act investors are cautioned that all statements trend analyses and other information contained in this report or in any of our filings under

words such as anticipate believe plan estimate expect intend and other similar expressions constitute forwardlooking statements under the reform act these forwardlooking statements are subject to known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors many of which are beyond our control that may cause actual results to be materially different from those contemplated by the forwardlooking statements such factors include among other things  general economic conditions and market factors such as prevailing interest rate levels stock market performance and fluctuations in the market for retirementoriented savings products which may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services and the market value of our investments and assets under management and therefore the portion of our revenues that are based on a percentage of assets under management  our ability to manage effectively our investment spread ie the amount by which investment income exceeds interest credited to annuity and life insurance policyholders as a result of changes in interest rates and crediting rates to policyholders market conditions and other factors our results of operations and financial condition are significantly dependent on our ability to manage effectively our investment spread  levels of surrenders and withdrawals of our retirementoriented insurance products  our ability to manage effectively certain risks with respect to our investment portfolio including risks relating to holding below investment grade securities and the ability to dispose of illiquid andor restricted securities at desired times and prices and the ability to manage and hedge against interest rate changes through assetliability management techniques  competition in the sale of our

financial condition and results of operations  the other risk factors or uncertainties contained from time to time in any document incorporated by reference in this report or otherwise filed by us under the exchange act given these uncertainties prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forwardlooking statements and no assurances can be given that the estimates and expectations reflected in such statements will be achieved d general account investments premium deposits on fixed and indexed annuities are credited to our general account and certain separate account investments which at december   totaled  billion total general account and certain separate account investments include cash and cash equivalents to maintain our investment spread at acceptable levels we must earn returns on its general account sufficiently in excess of the fixed or indexed returns credited to policyholders the key element of this investment process is assetliability management successful assetliability management requires both a quantitative assessment of overall policy liabilities including maturities surrenders and crediting of interest and prudent investment of general and certain separate account assets the two most important tools in managing policy liabilities are setting crediting rates and establishing surrender periods the investment process requires portfolio techniques that earn acceptable yields while effectively managing both interest rate risk and credit risk we emphasize a conservative approach to assetliability management which is oriented toward reducing downside risk in adverse markets as opposed to maximizing spread in favorable markets the approach is also designed to reduce earnings volatility various factors can impact our investment spread including changes in interest rates and other factors affecting our general account and certain separate account investments the bulk of our general account and certain separate account investments are invested in fixed maturity securities  at december   our principal strategy for managing interest rate risk is to closely match the duration of our general account investment portfolio to its policyholder balances we also employ hedging strategies to manage this risk including interest rate swaps and caps in the case of equityindexed products we purchase sp  index call options and futures to hedge its obligations to provide participation rate returns credit risk is managed by careful credit analysis and monitoring a portion of the general account and certain separate account investments  at december   are invested in below investment grade fixed maturity securities to enhance overall portfolio yield below investment grade securities pose greater risks than investment grade securities we actively manage our below investment grade portfolio to optimize our riskreturn profile at december   the carrying value of fixed maturity investments that were nonincome producing was  million which constituted  of our general account and certain separate account investments as of december   we owned approximately  billion of mortgagebacked securities  of its general and certain separate account investments  of which were investment grade mortgagebacked securities are subject to prepayment and extension risks since the underlying mortgages may be repaid more or less rapidly than scheduled as of december   approximately  billion  of our general and certain separate account investments were invested in securities that were sold without registration under the securities act and were not freely tradable under the securities act or which were otherwise illiquid these securities may be resold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act if we sought to sell such securities we might be unable to do so at the then current carrying values and might have to dispose of such securities over extended periods of time at uncertain levels e marketing and distribution our sales strategy is to use multiple distribution channels to achieve broader market presence during  the bank channel represented approximately  of our annuity sales and the brokerage channel represented approximately  the sale of insurance and investment products through the bank distribution channel is highly regulated sales through other distributors of insurance products such as financial planners insurance agents and an institutional channel represented approximately  of total annuity sales the following table presents sales

business activities are extensively regulated the following briefly summarizes the principal regulatory requirements and certain related matters our retirementoriented insurance products generally are issued to individuals the policy is a contract between the issuing insurance company and the policyholder state law regulates policy forms including all principal contract terms in most cases the policy form must be approved by the insurance department or similar agency of a state in order for the policy to be sold in that state we are chartered in rhode island and the state of rhode island insurance department is our primary oversight regulator we also must be licensed by the state insurance regulators in each other jurisdiction in which we conduct business we are currently licensed to conduct business in  states the exception being new york and in the district of columbia and the virgin islands state insurance laws generally provide regulators with broad powers related to issuing licenses to transact business regulating marketing and other trade practices operating guaranty associations regulating certain premium rates regulating insurance holding company systems establishing reserve requirements prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and reports performing financial and other examinations determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus regulating the type and amount of investments permitted limiting the amount of dividends that can be paid and the size of transactions that can be consummated without first obtaining regulatory approval and other related matters the regulators also make periodic examinations of individual companies and review annual and other reports on the financial conditions of all companies operating within their respective jurisdictions we prepare our statutorybasis financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of rhode island state laws prescribe certain statutory accounting practices permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices that are not proscribed such practices may differ between the states and companies within a state in  the naic adopted codified statutory accounting principles codification codification will likely change to some extent prescribed statutory accounting practices and may result in changes to the accounting practices that we use to prepare our statutorybased financial statements codification will require adoption by the various states before it becomes the prescribed statutory basis of accounting for insurance companies domesticated within those states accordingly before codification becomes effective for the company the state of rhode island must adopt codification as the prescribed basis of accounting on which domestic insurers must report their statutorybasis results to the insurance department the state of rhode island has adopted codification the adoption of codification on our statutorybasis financial statements in rhode island will reduce statutory surplus at january   by  million riskbased capital requirements in recent years various states have adopted new quantitative standards promulgated by the naic these standards are designed to reduce the risk of insurance company insolvencies in part by providing an early warning of financial or other difficulties these standards include the naics riskbased capital rbc requirements rbc requirements attempt to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in a companys mix of products and investment portfolio the requirements provide for four different levels of regulatory attention which implement increasing levels of regulatory control ranging from development of an action plan to mandatory receivership as of december   our capital and surplus exceeded the level at which the least severe of these regulatory attention levels would be triggered guaranty fund assessments under the insurance guaranty fund laws existing in each state insurers can be assessed for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants because assessments typically are not made for several years after an insurer fails we cannot accurately determine the precise amount or timing of its exposure to known insurance company insolvencies at this time for certain information regarding our historical and estimated future assessments see note  to our consolidated financial statements the insolvency of large life insurance companies in future years could result in material assessments to us by state guaranty funds no assurance can be given that such assessments would not have a material adverse effect on us insurance holding company regulation current rhode island insurance law permits us to pay dividends or distributions to liberty financial which together with dividends and distributions paid during the preceding  months do not exceed the lesser of i  of statutory surplus as of the preceding december  or ii the net gain from operations for the preceding fiscal year any proposed dividend in excess of this amount is called an extraordinary dividend and may not be paid until it is approved by the commissioner of insurance of the state of rhode island we paid  million and  million in dividends to liberty financial during  and  respectively as of december   the amount of additional dividends that we could pay without such approval was  million in addition no person or group may acquire directly or indirectly  or more of our voting stock or voting power unless such person has provided certain required information to the rhode island department of business regulation and such acquisition is approved by the department general regulation at federal level and certain related matters although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways current and proposed federal measures that may significantly affect the insurance business include limitations on antitrust immunity minimum solvency requirements and the removal of barriers restricting banks from engaging in the insurance business in particular several proposals to repeal or modify the bank holding company act of  which prohibits banks from being affiliated with insurance companies have been made by members of congress moreover the united states supreme court held in  in nationsbank of north carolina v variable annuity life insurance company that annuities are not insurance for purposes of the national bank act in addition the supreme court also held in  in barnett bank of marion city v nelson that state laws prohibiting national banks from selling insurance in small town locations are preempted by federal law the office of the comptroller of the currency adopted a ruling in november  that permits national banks under certain circumstances to expand into other financial services thereby increasing competition for us at present the extent to which banks can sell insurance and annuities without regulation by state insurance departments is being litigated in various courts in the united states although the effect of these recent developments on us and our competitors is uncertain there can be no assurance that such developments would not have a material adverse effect on us on november   the grammleachbliley act of  was signed into law the major provisions of this new law became effective on november   while the grammleachbliley act eliminates legal barriers to affiliates among banks insurance companies and other financial services companies and therefore effectively repeals the glasssteagall act of  which restricted banks from engaging in securitiesrelated businesses the effect on us and our competitors is uncertain g competition our business activities are conducted in extremely competitive markets we compete with a large number of life insurance companies some of which are larger and more highly capitalized and have higher ratings than we do no one company dominates the industry in addition our products compete with alternative investment vehicles available through financial institutions brokerage firms and investment managers management believes that we compete principally with respect to product features pricing ratings and service management also believes that we can continue to compete successfully in this market by offering innovative products and superior services in addition financial institutions and brokerdealers focus on the insurers ratings for financial strength or claimspaying ability in determining whether to market the insurers annuities h employees as of december   we had  fulltime employees we provide our employees with a broad range of employee benefit programs we believe that our relations

hedged at both inception and throughout the hedge period from time to time interest rate swap agreements cap agreements and call options are terminated if the terminated position was accounted for as a hedge realized gains or losses are deferred and amortized over the remaining lives of the hedged assets or liabilities conversely if the terminated position was not accounted for as a hedge or if

formula the applicable surrender or transfer value is multiplied by the market value adjustment factor to arrive at the market value adjustment the formula that is used to determine the market value adjustment factor is abn   where the values in the formula are as follows a  the treasury rate for the term of the account from which the surrender or transfer amount is being taken Â  Â  Â  b  the treasury rate for a period equal to the time remaining rounded up to the next whole number of account years to the expiration of the term for the account from which the surrender or transfer amount is being taken and Â  Â  Â  n  the number of complete account months remaining before the expiration of the term for the account from which the surrender or transfer amount is being taken multiplied by the applicable scaling factor from the certificate schedule for the term of the account from which the amount is being taken if the account is an indexed account the first account month begins on the day that the term begins and each subsequent account month begins on the same day one month later the treasury rate for an account is the interest rate in the treasury constant maturity series as published by the federal reserve board for a maturity equal to the number of years specified in a and b above weekly series are published at the beginning of the following week to determine a we use the weekly series first published on or after the most recent determination date which occurs on or before the first day of the accounts current term except that if the first day is the same as the determination date or the date of publication or any date in between we instead use the weekly series first published after the prior determination date to determine b we use the weekly series first published on or after the most recent determination date which occurs on or before the date on which the market value adjustment factor is calculated except that if the calculation date is the same as the determination date or the date of publication or any date in between we instead use the weekly series first published after the prior determination date the determination dates are the last business days prior to the first and fifteenth days of each month if the number of years specified in a or b does not equal a maturity in the treasury constant maturity series the treasury rate will be determined by straight line interpolation between the interest rate for the next highest and next lowest maturities illustrations and surrender charge calculations illustration   assume that you purchased a certificate for  and allocated your interest to an interest account with a fiveyear term and a guaranteed interest rate of  exactly two years later your account was surrendered when the surrender charge was  there had been no prior surrenders and the interest earned in the previous twelve months is equal to     therefore the surrender charge and the market value adjustment do not apply to  of the interest account value at the beginning of the term the treasury rate for year treasury notes was  and at the time of the surrender the treasury rate for year treasury notes was  according to the certificate the market value adjustment is a  free withdrawal amount x b  c where a  the amount surrendered Â    x  x  Â    Â  Â  Â  b  the market value adjustment factor Â   abn   where Â  Â  Â  Â  a  the treasury rate for the term of the account from which the surrender amount is being taken here a   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  b  the treasury rate for a period equal to the time remaining rounded up to the next whole number of account years to the expiration of the term for the account from which the surrender amount is being taken here b   Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  n  the number of complete account months remaining before the expiration of the term for the account from which the surrender amount is being taken multiplied by the applicable scaling factor from the certificate schedule for the term of the account from which the amount is being taken if the account is an indexed account here n   b     Â      Â    therefore c  a   x b Â      x  Â    is the market value adjustment which would be added to the account value in determining the certificate withdrawal value the surrender charge is equal to i x a  free withdrawal amount where a  the surrendered amount   and Â  Â  Â  i  the surrender charge percentage here i   therefore the surrender charge   x    Â    x  Â    Â  Â  Â  the certificate value   x  x    x    Â    Â  Â  Â  the adjusted certificate value   x      Â    under the certificate the certificate withdrawal value is equal to the greater of  the amount surrendered less any surrender charge plus any market value adjustment or  the adjusted certificate value here the certificate withdrawal value would be the greater of        or  therefore the certificate withdrawal value is equal to  illustration   given the same circumstances as in illustration  but using a year treasury rate of  instead of  at the time of surrender the market value adjustment is computed as follows b     Â      Â    therefore c  a   x b Â      x  Â   negative  is the market value adjustment which would be subtracted from the account value in determining the certificate withdrawal value as described in the previous example the surrender charge would equal  the adjusted certificate value   x      Â    accordingly the certificate withdrawal value would be the greater of        or  therefore the certificate withdrawal value is equal to  illustration   given the same circumstances as in illustration  but assuming i an indexed account instead of an interest account with an account value of  ii index increases credited in the prior year equal to  and iii a scaling factor k of  the market value adjustment is computed as follows b   x k   Â    x    Â      Â    therefore c  a   x b Â      x  Â   negative  is the market value adjustment which would be subtracted from the account value in determining the certificate withdrawal value as described in the previous example the surrender charge would equal  the certificate value   x  x    x    Â    Â  Â  Â  the
