supported by business day sheila talton on helping employees up the ladder corner office by adam bryant march   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story this interview with sheila talton chief executive of gray matter analytics a consulting firm for financial services and health care was conducted and condensed by adam bryant q when you were a child were you in leadership rolesa i was not when i was younger i remember being the only africanamerican in my brownie troop and girl scouts and i never got picked for anything but when i got to high school i was picked to be an organizer in my high school around civil rights issues that was one of the first times someone said to me “sheila you’ve got a point of view about this why don’t you lead us and tell us how we might want to organize and march and protest”i carried that through to college and i was so passionate about it that i forgot to go to class a lot as a result i was asked to leave college as i like to say because i spent all my time organizing and protesting that was during the vietnam eraso i got a job as a secretary at a forklift company there was a salesman there a white male and one day he came over to me — and remember i was quite militant — and he said “why are you here” i said “what do you mean why am i here” he said “i’ve watched you you’re capable of so much more” he went on to compliment me about how i took initiative and he said “why aren’t you in college” advertisement continue reading the main story i explained that i flunked out because i spent a lot of time organizing and protesting he said that i should go back and that if i took some really difficult classes at a community college like quantitative analysis and statistics and aced them the college would take me back “and i’ll tutor you” he said i did exactly what he said i aced the classes reapplied and went back to northern illinois university and graduated on the dean’s list continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story when i started thinking about career paths i thought about discrimination a lot i asked myself “what field could i go into where there’s a shortage of talent and i would be able to ascend and have a lot of success if i were extremely good at it” i decided on technologytell me about your parentsmy father was a very smart man he was a laborer but much of that was because of the time he came along as well there weren’t many opportunities for africanamerican men but he coached me he told me to never let anyone define what my path would be and should be in life he was always telling me to be very selective of people he was very discerning it wasn’t that he didn’t trust people it was more about having the right kind of people around you to support you and complement you and to be thoughtful about it photo  “it’s very important that my team know that i’m invested in their career” credit chester higgins jrthe new york times my mother always saw the glass half full i’ve worked in big corporations but i’ve had many entrepreneurial roles including this one i think i get a lot of that from my mother because the thought of not being able to succeed never really crossed her mind how do you hirethere are certain people who love change and some who don’t do well with change and change is part of being in technology one of the things i’ve learned in selecting people is to discern who will thrive on change and then put them in roles where the waters are going to be choppy newsletter sign up continue reading the main

see sample manage email preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime one question i ask is “tell me about a situation either with one of your former bosses or perhaps with a client where it was really difficult and the outcome was not good” what i listen for is how much ownership and responsibility they showed in trying to steer through the choppy waters if they show leadership that says to me that they welcome change another question i ask is “tell me about your successes and how you accomplished them” i listen for words like “we” and “us” if i hear a lot of “i’s” that tells me a lot about their ability to collaboratei’m really looking for transformational leadership — leaders who actually drive transformation rather than just reacting to it in the technology world there’s a number of very successful large corporations that are now finding themselves having to react to transformational change some of that is just because you get to a certain size and it’s just so difficult to turn the ship as quickly as you need to that’s why you have most of the innovation coming out of smaller more nimble companieswhat advice do you give to graduating college studentsone of the things i say to them is “find the voids and fill them there’s no shortage of things that are not getting done in large organizations and small ones there are always voids go fill them”other mentoring adviceone thing i’ve done a lot over the years is to push my stars out i’ve had a number of people who worked for me who were really good at what they did and many times when i would be sitting in meetings with my peers and they’d say “i’ve got to hire somebody to do this” i often would offer up some of my people for them to interview advertisement continue reading the main story many of them would ask me why and there are a few reasons it’s very important that my team know that i’m invested in their career second it’s the right thing for the organization third it gives me influence in that other part of the organizationbut a lot of managers want to hold on to their stars because they help them look goodwell eventually you’re going to lose them anyway you may as well be proactive because people don’t forget that then if you need anything in that part of the organization where they’re now working they will help youbut you’re right many managers actually try to hoard their people especially their good ones then with the ones they want to get rid of they’ll say to you “you know i’ve got just the person for you” continue reading the main story we’re interested in
