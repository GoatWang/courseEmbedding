hemostasis market is clearly in search of products that work better faster and more reliably the ac surgical hemostatic device™ is designed to do that arch believes its products will be significantly superior to what is currently available ac™ is a synthetic peptide comprising naturally occurring amino acids evidence todate supports that it is biocompatible when squirted or sprayed onto a wound ac™ promptly intercalates into the nooks and crannies of the connective tissue where it builds itself into a physical mechanical structure that structure provides a barrier to leaking substances including blood and other bodily fluids regardless of type of surgery or based on early data clotting ability healing occurs normally the structural building process is called selfassembly and it provides a new and improved approach to addressing “stasis and barrier applications” the need modern surgical procedures drive demand for improved therapies every day around the world millions of surgical procedures are taking place many are planned months in advance while many more are in response to emergency needs because these procedures are invasive surgeons and other medical specialists focus on optimizing patient outcomes – and they constantly strive for fewer complications including reduced fluid and blood loss in order to obtain the best results while maximizing safety and minimizing time to recovery they also operate today through smaller incisions in the body in procedures known as minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery the solution ac™ stasis and barrier technology ac™ itself is designed at the nanoscale its a synthetic peptide comprised of naturally occurring nonanimal amino acids using straightforward manufacturing techniques ac™ is applied directly onto a surgical or traumatic wound where it rapidly creates a physical barrier in the nooks and crannies of the tissue and promptly stops bleeding and fluid leaks its not sticky or gluelike and is very easy to prepare and handle its also a clear transparent gel enabling doctors to see through it as they work performing “crystal clear surgery™” the result faster and safer surgical outcomes once

hemorrhage laparoscopic surgery also called minimally invasive surgery mis or keyhole surgery is a modern surgical technique in which operations are performed through small incisions usually – cm as opposed to the larger incisions needed in open surgery keyhole surgery makes use of images displayed on tv monitors to magnify the surgical elements corporate mission the mission of arch therapeutics is to develop products that will improve the lives of patients and enhance the quality of care offered by healthcare personnel we intend to offer compelling options to healthcare institutions facing limited resources arch therapeutics strives to be a leader in the field of stasis and barrier applications this includes but is not limited to hemostasis and sealant products we intend to develop products with dramatically improved profiles and characteristics over products on the market or in development we intend to broaden the scope of the field by developing improved solutions to problems beyond the traditional hemostasis and sealant realms arch therapeutics is focused on capital efficiency our operational plans are geared toward achieving valuecreating milestones in a manner that optimizes quality probability of success and cost effectiveness arch therapeutics believes in the value of intellectual property we intend to file and defend patents and other intellectual property as required in order to vigorously protect our assets ideas and inventions arch therapeutics plans to achieve its mission with a small core team the realization of our business objectives amidst the challenges of the modern healthcare environment requires that the best supporting people surround us we value a healthy mix of seasoned entrepreneurs scientists business people and investors in a disciplined environment arch therapeutics believes that by focusing on the above objectives we will achieve the goal of providing an optimal return for our investors to whom we are thankful market scope over  million us and  million worldwide annual surgeries are driving positive ambulatory and laparoscopic surgical trends according to medmarket diligence llc approximately  million surgical and procedurebased wounds occur annually worldwide including  million from surgery in the us which can benefit from sealants andor hemostatic agents these figures are consistent with internal estimates derived from published data  trends that support the increasing demand in “biomaterials” include ambulatory same day surgery volume growth  inpatient volume is  laparoscopic procedure volume growth operating room time reduction  according to medmarket diligence a  hemostat that saves four minutes in operating time pays for itself and these “products can often save anywhere from five minutes to two hours depending on the procedure” surgeons are expected to meet greater challenges target market size and trends use of hemostatic agents and sealants is increasing the market achieved b in  worldwide sales and was projected to reach b in   current projections now indicate sales may exceed b in  and b in  over twothirds of these sales are for hemostats but a greater sealant growth rate is projected due to a relative paucity of products and an even larger unmet need the most useful hemostatic agents can cost upwards of application yet a relatively small percent of surgeons use them often citing their limitations supported by views of thoughtleaders improved products would see better uptake thus growing the already large market another trend is the shift over the past two decades to performing surgery in the less expensive outpatient setting while this trend continues bleeding risks force many otherwise straightforward cases to be performed in the hospital inpatient setting which typically provides greater support for significant potential complications the biggest trend is to perform surgery less invasively less invasive procedures produce shorter recovery times faster discharges less scarring less pain and less need for pain medications open surgery has moved to laparoscopic surgery  of procedures traditional laparoscopic surgery three openings is slowly moving to singleport laparoscopic surgery one opening which is more difficult to perform while still in its infancy there is a move afoot to advance the techniques of notes natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery which is a method of performing surgery without creating openings in the exterior of the body by using natural orifices to reach the intended surgical destination instead the implication of these trends is that physicians need more advanced materials that are precisely deliverable easily controlled maintain a clear field of vision and work reliably and promptly furthermore the concern of leaking anastomosis in a patient who underwent laparoscopic surgery is prevalent some suggest that one of the main hurdles to the uptake of notes is concern over leaks after the “opening inside the orifice” is closed  many physicians stated they could use our product in the majority of their laparoscopic procedures especially as prophylaxis against leaks that occur after the patient has moved to a postoperative environment existing treatments arch can transform the landscape the competition has limitations “surveys of general vascular thoracic and neurosurgeons affirm the need for products that will work within one minute preferably  seconds remain effective for  days and absorb within  weeks…” surgical “biomaterials” for hemostasis and sealant are out of date surgical and trauma patients are at significant risk for morbidity and mortality from bleeding andor leaking body fluids while surgical techniques instrumentation and technology have made tremendous strides over the last couple of decades the majority of hemostatic agents and sealants that surgeons rely on to help stop bleeding and seal leakages have not kept up even though some companies have made incremental improvements on firstgeneration hemostatic products example a recombinant version of thrombin to eliminate adverse effects associated with animalderived blood products revolutionary advances have been elusive because the underlying technologies have basic limitations fortunately thought leaders have been vocal about what is missing and that is where arch steps in surgeons agree that the ideal agent to stop bleeding or leaking does not currently exist surveys of general vascular thoracic and neurosurgeons affirm the need for products that will work within one minute preferably  seconds remain effective for  days and absorb within  weeks among other needs a product exceeding these customer expectations should achieve a high level of success if it possesses both sealing and hemostasis crossover potential the opportunity should be further enhanced starting with surgical hemostasis arch intends to transform the landscape of interventional care whether due to surgery or trauma burn or biopsy any hole made in the body must be properly sealed and managed customers desire a democratic multipurpose technology to seal and protect that hole without interfering with normal healing while surgeons and trauma care providers have available products to stop bleeding they are often “metoo” products that are largely variations on relatively narrow and very old themes or classes these possess significant drawbacks the underlying technologies confer inherent performance limitations with implications for the surgeon and the patient drawbacks of these products

surgical hemostatic device™ and other arch planned pipeline products achieves its desired effect resides in the domain of the nanoscale the design and control of actm provides the desired high ordered nanostructures arch techniques use organic chemistry instead of expensive biotech or plasmabased methods simpler manufacturing methods are important important determinants of product value are its manufacturing methods type and source of ingredients and burden of waste byproduct elimination industry is keenly aware of the downside of technologies that rely on expensive biotechnology techniques and facilities for manufacture onerous and expensive programs to eliminate complex materials or ingredients that are sourced from the complicated process of human or other animal plasma separation such products typically are expensive infrastructure intensive burdensome and at greater risk for failing regulatory oversight versus simpler options arch’s manufacturing methods avoid these complexities arch’s planned products will be synthesized of naturally occurring ingredients that are not sourced from humans or other animals these ingredients which are the building blocks of the human body are categorized as gras generally recognized as safe convey a lower risk of adverse effects and exist in their natural state in humans product hemostatic agent ac™ for control over surgical bleeding the ac surgical hemostatic device™  more than just a better mousetrap the hemostasis market is clearly in search of products that work better faster and more reliably the ac surgical hemostatic device™ is designed to do that arch believes its products will be significantly superior to what is currently available ac™ is a synthetic peptide comprising naturally occurring amino acids evidence todate supports that it is biocompatible when squirted or sprayed onto a wound ac™ promptly intercalates into the nooks and crannies of the connective tissue where it builds itself into a physical mechanical structure that structure provides a barrier to leaking substances including blood and other bodily fluids regardless of type of surgery or based on early data clotting ability healing occurs normally the structural building process is called selfassembly and it provides a new and improved approach to addressing “stasis and barrier applications” the need modern surgical procedures drive demand for improved therapies   every day around the world millions of surgical procedures are taking place many are planned months in advance while many more are in response to emergency needs because these procedures are invasive surgeons and other medical specialists focus on optimizing patient outcomes – and they constantly strive for fewer complications including reduced fluid and blood loss in order to obtain the best results while maximizing safety and minimizing time to recovery they also operate today through smaller incisions in the body in procedures known as minimally invasive or laparoscopic surgery the solution ac™ stasis and barrier technology ac™ itself is designed at the nanoscale its a synthetic peptide comprised of naturally occurring nonanimal amino acids using straightforward manufacturing techniques ac™ is applied directly onto a surgical or traumatic wound where it rapidly creates a physical barrier in the nooks and crannies of the tissue and promptly stops bleeding and fluid leaks its not sticky or gluelike and is very easy to prepare and handle its also a clear transparent gel enabling doctors to see through it as they work performing “crystal clear surgery™” the result faster and safer surgical outcomes once applied ac™ works quickly to stop bleeding with rapid onset of hemostasis with ac™ surgeons are able to perform surgery through the protective barrier safely once the incision heals ac™ is naturally absorbed and passes from the body development the following charts summarize the dramatic improvement in hemostasis seen to date in animal testing the chart above shows the improvement of ac surgical hemostatic device™ over both a control substance and a control peptide the last chart shows the improvement of ac surgical hemostatic device™ over both cautery and saline control substances   this chart shows how quickly actm stops bleeding in preclinical studies the barely discernable green
