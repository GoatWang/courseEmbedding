includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business combination  in addition a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of a loan from m iii llc of up to  that we may draw down as described in this prospectus this loan will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions in the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table any such amounts will be used for postclosing working capital expenses  the underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to  of the gross proceeds of this offering if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised  of the gross proceeds from the overallotment will be deposited in the trust account as deferred underwriting commissions upon completion of our initial business combination up to  which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions or up to  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital the underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses the amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account to pay our taxes based on the current interest rate environment we would expect approximately  per year to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over  months following the closing of this offering however we can provide no assurances regarding this amount this estimate assumes an interest rate of  per annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested  includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for financing the rules of the nasdaq capital market provide that at least  of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units  or  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full including up to  or up to  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  per year assuming an interest rate of  per year we will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or working capital expenses until the earlier of i the completion of our initial business combination or ii the redemption of  of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to the requirements of law based on current interest rates we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes or a substantial portion of working capital expenses the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us m iii llc has loaned or agreed to loan us up to  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering this loan is noninterest bearing unsecured and is due at the earlier of july   or the closing of this offering this loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans will be convertible into warrants of the postbusiness combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants no written agreements exist with respect to such loans if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor directors officers advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets upon consummation of our initial business combination to be less than  so that we are not subject to the sec’s “penny stock” rules and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i our completion of an initial business combination and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein or ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months following the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations including but not limited to cash requirements created by the terms of the proposed business combination in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us and cantor fitzgerald has agreed as part of its unit purchase agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares private placement shares and except for cantor fitzgerald public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial stockholders and cantor fitzgerald have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares and private placement shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame however if our sponsor or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a delaware blank check corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination we have not identified any business combination target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions directly or indirectly with any business combination target we intend to focus our efforts on seeking and consummating an initial business combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between  million and  million although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise value may be considered while we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector and in any geographic region we expect to focus on businesses based in north america that engage primarily in the financial services healthcare services and industrials sectors because we believe that this best combines the expertise and experience of our combined team with sectors that offer attractive investment opportunities it is our philosophy that capital has become increasingly commoditized and that successful investment results will come not from having capital alone but rather from having the ability to accurately assess businesses with complex strategic management and operational issues and the added expertise to deal with these issues in increasingly competitive and changing environments we believe this to be particularly true during times of economic uncertainty dislocations in capital markets and other conditions that create a challenge for businesses and opportunities for investors with the right management team in recognition of this we have assembled a team of executives directors and other advisors who blend traditional investment and acquisition expertise management and operational expertise and deep experience in financial strategic and operational restructurings we are confident that this team is capable of creating value in businesses that we acquire we believe that the broad experience and expertise of our combined team will enable us to explore a wide range of potential acquisition targets we intend to target companies with strong business fundamentals and those which are in need of operational improvement and can thereby benefit from our human and financial capital the members of our combined team have proven experience and track records in identifying acquiring and improving businesses that have strong underlying fundamentals but are undervalued due to companyspecific issues industry dislocation limited access to capital or other exogenous factors that are fundamentally temporary in nature our combined team has played meaningful roles in contrarian investment situations with businesses requiring significant changes in strategy enhancement of management or operational improvement using our expertise in those areas to improve the businesses and drive ongoing growth we believe that the experience capabilities and track record of our combined team will make us an attractive partner for potential target businesses enhance our ability to complete a successful business combination and thereafter improve the performance of the business in

corporation right for your business what you need to know about forming a c corporation what is a c corporation a c corporation is one of several ways to legally recognize a business for tax regulatory and official reasons a c corp is simply a way to structure ownership of a business and contrasts with other popular business structures including limited liability companies llcs s corporations sole proprietorships and others generally a c corporation structure is better for larger businesses this is particularly true if they intend to publicly trade shares through having an initial public offering or ipo a c corporation is much more attractive to potential investors including venture capitalists and shareholders because it allows wider ownership of the corporation the majority of larger businesses in the united states are structured as c corporations although a c corp could theoretically consist of just one person the information below will help you decide if a c corporation structure is right for your business how is a c corporation formed a c corp also known as a corporation is a type of business entity that is formed and regulated on a state level the corporation is formed by filing “articles of incorporation” with the secretary of state in the state of incorporation the policies articles cost and regulations for forming a c corp vary from statetostate details on exactly how to form a c corporation can be found at the end of this article the corporation is the oldest form of business entity it has long been a successful way to do business and allows groups of individuals to pool their resources and capital to pursue a common purpose with their risk limited solely to the amount of stock they own although a c corp is a popular business structure there are other options for forming businesses in the us the advantages of c corporations forming a c corporation does have several benefits  a c corporation has limited liability because a c corp is a separate legal entity the liabilities of the business are separate from the liabilities of the directors investors and shareholders generally the owners of a c corporation are protected from being liable for the business’s obligations this does not apply in all cases for example if corporate funds are misused there is wilful fraud or if certain rules and regulations are not followed  a c corporation exists independently of its owners a c corporation can have “perpetual existence” — this is in contrast to sole proprietorships or partnerships where a business only exists for as long as the proprietors or owners are alive and in the business  ownership of c corporations can be fluid and transferred ownership in a c corporation is decided by who holds the stocks it issues these stocks can be bought and sold between investors and if the company’s shares are publicly traded on a stock exchange institutions and members of the public can own stock in the company  ease of access to funding through issuing stock if a c corporation want to raise money it can hold an “initial public offering ipo” where it “goes public” and offers shares for sale on a stock exchange this can bring significant money into a business they can also choose to issue shares periodically to raise further funding although this can dilute the value of existing shares  enhanced business or corporate credibility most of the businesses that are household names are c corporations incorporating as a c corp demonstrates to others that you expect to see significant growth and can enhance the business’s credibility and authority the disadvantages of a c corporation a c corporation does have some disadvantages briefly they are a different tax structure to other types of businesses double taxation for investors when dividends are paid to them legal rules regulations formalities and compliance they have to meet we cover these in more detail below what are the differences between an s corp c corp and llc two other popular business entity structures in the us are the s corp and the llc they provide many of the same protections offered by a c corp but have less formal rules on taxation governance and compliance this can mean more flexibility in how an llc or s corp is owned and funded one of the main differences between c corps and s corps  llcs are how income from the different types of businesses are taxed for llcs and s corps any income earned by the business “flows through” to the business owners’  shareholders’  members’ tax returns where it is taxed as part of their overall income the company does not have to file a separate tax return s corps and c corps can pass on some of their profits to shareholders as dividends s corps are limited to having a maximum of  shareholders a c corp is taxed at the corporate level — that means it has to file a separate tax return as a business entity and will need to pay corporation tax on any profits earned how are profits and taxes handled with a c corp a c corporation is taxed as a separate business entity unlike individuals c corporations have to file a designated tax form with the irs which is called irs form  additionally c corporations have their own tax rates corporations can retain some of their profits and earnings as part of their operating capital this can shelter some of the profits from taxation c corporation tax rates the tax rates levied on c corporations are as follows profit up to  —     —     —     —     —     —     —  more than  —  stock dividends from c corporations a c corporation may choose to distribute some of the profits of the company as dividends which are distributed to shareholders the percentage of dividends that each shareholder is entitled to depends on how many shares they own dividends that are distributed to shareholders are taxed twice doubletaxed they are taxed first at the corporate level as profit on the corporation’s form  and again at the individual level as stock dividends on the shareholders form  what are a c corporations legal requirements a c corporation must meet certain requirements  hold an annual general meeting agm for the shareholders and the board of directors the annual meetings are used to discuss and decide important information strategic decisions opportunities risks and issues that the corporation will need to deal with  issue shares to investors as ownership of the business ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares the management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders  appoint a board of directors the board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation the board of directors also drafts bylaws for the corporation these are written protocols that state the way that the corporation will be governed  assign certain positions in the corporation a c corporation will need to have all of the following positions in a small c corp one person could hold multiple of these positions shareholders they own the companys stock and are responsible for electing directors amending the bylaws and articles of incorporation and approving major actions taken by the corporation like mergers and the sale of corporate assets they alone are allowed to dissolve the corporation directors they manage the corporation and are responsible for issuing stock electing officers and making the corporations major decisions officers the corporation must have a president secretary and treasurer these officers are responsible for making the daytoday decisions that govern the corporations operation employees they receive a salary in return for their work for the corporation forming a c

 off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record
