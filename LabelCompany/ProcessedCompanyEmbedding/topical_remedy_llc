this article in this article choosing a topical when to change things up the dry patches of skin you get with psoriasis can be itchy and uncomfortable but the right treatment plan can help your doctor will likely suggest creams lotions foams sprays solutions and ointments these are topical treatments  meaning you put them directly on your skin or scalp a number of products are available you can get some over the counter otc at the drugstore but for others youll need a prescription it may take time to find what works best for you choosing a topical moisturizers and lotions that you buy without a prescription can keep your skin moist and help control flareups in general thick greasy lotions that trap moisture in your skin work best salicylic acid removes scales that appear on patches of psoriasis it comes in lotions gels soaps and shampoos its especially helpful when used with other skin treatments removing flakes of dead skin allows other medications to work better coal tar can help slow the growth of skin cells and make your skin look better it too comes in many different forms the weaker products are available otc the shampoo helps treat scalp psoriasis coal tar doesnt smell good and it can irritate your skin and stain your clothes follow the directions carefully some studies show that the chemicals in coal tar are cancerous but this is only true at very high doses its safe to use these products if you follow your doctors instructions steroids corticosteroids reduce puffiness inflammation and slow the growth of skin cells so they dont build up they come in different strengths weaker formulas may work for sensitive areas like the face neck or skinfold areas like the groin or armpit you may need stronger ones for toughtotreat places like your elbows and knees youll probably apply your treatment twice a day your doctor may suggest you wrap the area with tape or plastic after you treat it this is a method called occlusion it can help some treatments work better but it may also make side effects stronger the side effects include thinning of skin changes in skin color bruising more visible stretch marks continued make sure you follow your doctors directions overusing the medicine can lead to more serious health problems sometimes steroids work better when used along with other medications vitamin d creams lotions foams and solutions like calcipotriene calcitrene dovonex sorilux slow the growth of your skin cells for longterm use these products may be safer for you than steroids but they can irritate your skin your doctor will probably suggest you use small amounts twice a day be careful not to get it on your healthy skin some of these medications can make you sick if you swallow them so keep them away from children and pets and make sure your doctor knows what other medicines youre taking some can stop vitamin d products from working your doctor may suggest you use vitamin d together with a steroid one medication is a combination of both its called taclonex calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate retinoids like tazarotene tazorac can help speed up the growth and shedding of skin cells these gels or creams have vitamin a and come in different strengths typically you put a small dab on each lesion once a day before bed doctors usually suggest women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant not use these products anthralin slows the growth of skin cells and lowers inflammation it doesnt have any serious side effects but it can irritate the skin and stain clothing sheets and skin its often used with other medications pimecrolimus elidel tacrolimus protopic and crisaborole eucrisa can help stop swelling inflammation your doctor may call these drugs calcineurin inhibitors theyre sometimes used to treat psoriasis when other medications dont work talk to your doctor before taking these medications and read the fda black box warning on the label there may be a link between these drugs and lymphoma cancer of the lymphatic system and skin cancer when to change things up these treatments work well for many people but they aren’t a sure bet dont be surprised if something that was working stops  or if something that’s never helped before starts to do some good let your doctor know what makes a difference and what doesn’t together you can choose the right products many topical treatments can irritate your skin so over time your doctor may suggest that you cycle through different types of creams you may also use them along with other types of treatments like phototherapy or medications you take by mouth or inject before you start using topical treatments make sure you understand the directions and the side effects they can cause stick with your treatment plan too if you dont use your medication

right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more
