arthritis aids acid reflux disease various phobias depression obesity diabetes multiple sclerosis lupus chronic fatigue syndrome attention deficit disorder and muscular dystrophy had been deliberately hidden from the public by the food and drug administration the federal trade commission and the major food and drug companies in one widely quoted example he asserted that the university of calgary had developed a natural diabetes treatment then quashed its data fearing reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry a spokesman for the school told abc news that there have been no human studies

contained only additional similarly unsubstantiated speculation according to the cpb the chicago tribune also noted that a purported backcover endorsement by former fda commissioner herbert ley—who

want you to know about the book describes a weight loss plan originally proposed by british endocrinologist atw simeons in the s involving injections of human chorionic gonadotropin the diet was criticized in  by the journal of the american medical association as hazardous to human health and a waste of money in  the ftc ordered clinics and promoters of the simeons diet and hcg to inform prospective patients that there had not been substantial evidence to conclude hcg offered any benefit above that achieved on a restricted calorie diet clinical research trials published by the journal of the american medical association and the american journal of clinical nutrition have shown that hcg is ineffective as a weightloss aid citing no statistically significant difference in the means of the two groups and that hcg does not appear to enhance the effectiveness of a rigidly imposed regimen for weight reduction the ftc has filed a contemptofcourt action against trudeau alleging that the alleged misrepresentations in the book violate a  consent order debt cures “they” dont want you to know aboutedit debt cures was published in  and has been marketed on television chuck jaffee a columnist at cbs marketwatch stated truth be told most of the information in the book is readily available in personal finance columns you can find online or in books that are readily available in your local library trudeau says that if readers disagree with items on their credit reports they can dispute them as identity theft this was the magic cure of the books title trudeau sometimes mentions esteemed names throughout his books to extend himself credibility such as hazel valera executive director of the californiabased nonprofit organization clear credit exchange harvard law professor elizabeth warren and robert hinsley of consumers defense yet none of the mentioned were ever interviewed by trudeau your wish is your commandedit published in  the product says it gives tools on how to use the law of attraction to manifest readers desires the packaging also says it contains key links to using the law of attraction that are missing in other publications among the claims made in the related infomercial is trudeaus assertion to have virtually flunked out of high school he also says he was taken in by a mysterious group called the brotherhood that taught him the secrets that he is now widely announcing in his book there is also an invitation to join the now defunct global information network an exclusive group of highly influential affluent and freedomorientated sic people see below the network operated out of the caribbean island nevis and employed the law of attraction as its principal wealth generator a concept regarded by most in the scientific community as at best pseudoscience media interviewsedit trudeau has been interviewed by cnns paula zahn matt lauer of nbcs today show and harry smith of cbss the early show trudeau was also the subject of investigative reports done by inside edition abcs  and dateline nbc the  segment highlighted a nightline interview with jake tapper in which trudeau misrepresented the money he was forced to pay to the government the charges filed against him and the reason the government did not follow through with charges and claiming ignorance when the claims made in his book were called false by tapper trudeau was interviewed by jacques peretti for the fourth episode of the series the men who made us thin on bbc infomercialsedit at one time trudeau was a prolific producer of infomercials he consented to an ftc ban applying to everything except publications that the ftc concluded would infringe upon his first amendment rights all of his subsequent infomercials advertised

material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately especially if potentially libelous or harmful november  learn how and when to remove this template message trudeau says that pharmaceutical companies dont want us to get well because curing disease is not nearly as profitable as treating it in perpetuity according to trudeau the corporate profit motive overrides the human desire to truly help people trudeau says that natural treatments cannot be patented and are not profitable enough to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars in testing so they will always lack fda approval trudeau uses herpes as an example saying that people with herpes must buy an expensive drug for the rest of their lives he says that if there were a cheap easy cure for herpes the fda and pharmaceutical companies would not want the population to know about it because corporate profits would suffer he cites the number of advertisements on television for prescription drugs and points out that prescription drugs should be advertised to doctors not to the general public he states in one infomercial that there are twelve known cures for cancer but that they are being kept from the general public by the fda the ftc and the pharmaceutical companies he also says that the fda and the ftc are two of the most corrupt organizations in america and that there is a long list of chemical ingredients that are secretly not required to be on the fda ingredients label that are damaging to human health trudeau offers a conspiracy theory saying that the drug industry and the fda work with each other to effectively deceive the public by banning allnatural cures in order to protect the profits of the drug industry trudeau says that fda commissioners who leave the fda to work for large drug companies are paid millions of dollars in any other industry according to trudeau this would be called bribery a conflict of interest or payoffs trudeau also says in his infomercials that the food industry includes chemicals such as msg and aspartame to get people addicted to food and to make people obese trudeau has also declared that he will lead a crusade against the fda and the ftc and will make an effort to sue companies who promote false claims in advertising such as leading pharmaceutical companies references to scientific studiesedit one of the major complaints about trudeaus infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies making them impossible to crosscheck for accuracy the same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence he presents in the infomercials he does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods for example he tells a story in an infomercial about a friend from england who came to his house and complained of heartburn he also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of st johns wort compared to two prescription medications these studies the informercials suggest are identified in the book being advertised for sale but none of his books provide any such substantiation in an interview he explained that he cannot reveal his source material because of ftc suppression but readers can join his web site where for  a month or  for a lifetime they can gain access to the special membersonly section from which they can email him for the information newspaper articlesedit a pair of  associated press articles by candice choi on the infomercials elaborated on the success and problems of the programs choi says that by repeatedly mentioning government sanctions against him trudeau anticipated any backlash with his cuckoo conspiracy theory and can partially deflect any criticism of him or his infomercials trudeaus use of the word cure is an issue for regulators also bookstores are polled on their decisions to sell or not sell a successful and controversial selfpublished book additional marketing venturesedit audio tapes “mega memory”edit trudeau says he adapted techniques used to improve the memory of the blind and the mentally challenged to create mega memory and advanced mega memory audio tapes his promotion of memoryenhancing products was ended by the intervention of the federal trade commission which alleged that the claims made by trudeau were false and programs involved would not enable users to achieve a photographic memory as the advertising claimed trudeau used research that dr michael van masters conducted with the state school for the blind in muskogee oklahoma in  as the basis of the mega memory products trudeau was selling automobiles at neponset lincoln mercury in the dorchester neighborhood of boston in  when he first met van masters shortly after meeting van masters trudeau joined van masters in the memory business in chicagocitation needed nonsurgical faceliftedit in addition to natural cures trudeau also hosted an infomercial that features the perfect lift nonsurgical facelift in the united

announced that they did not have sufficient funds on hand to cover the purse winners were assured that they would receive their prizes in small installments but most were never paid the reno fiasco

credit card fraud after he stole the names and social security numbers of eleven customers of a mega memory product and charged  on their credit cards he spent two years in federal prison because of this conviction later in an interview he explained his crimes as  youthful indiscretions and not as bad as they sound and besides both were partly the fault of other people and besides he has changed the larceny he explains as a series of math errors compounded by the mistake of a bank official as for why the bank thought he was a doctor that was just a simple misunderstanding because he jokingly referred to himself as a doctor in memory he still cant quite believe he was prosecuted for the larceny charges give me a break he says  sec and various statesedit trudeau began working for nutrition

trudeau entered into a stipulated preliminary injunction that prohibited him from continuing to make the challenged claims for coral calcium supreme and biotape in the summer of  the court found

district of columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief trudeau also filed a motion for preliminary injunction which the court denied the complaint charged that the ftc had retaliated against him for his criticism of the agency by issuing a press release that falsely characterized and intentionally and deliberately misrepresented the  final order that conduct trudeau asserted exceeded the ftcs authority under  usc § f and violated the first amendment the ftc responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under rule b the district court granted the ftcs motion to dismiss first the court concluded that it lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction because the press release was not a final agency action under “section  of the administrative procedure act”  usc §  second the court held in the alternative that trudeau’s claims failed to state a viable cause of action as a matter of law trudeau later filed an appeal which was unsuccessful in reversing the courts ruling  trudeau v new york consumer protection boardedit trudeau filed a lawsuit on august   accusing the new york state consumer protection board of violating his first amendment rights by contacting television stations in new york state and urging them to pull trudeaus

stations the temporary restraining order was replaced by a preliminary injunction however trudeau lost a motion to have the board send a corrective letter to the television stations and subsequently dropped all claims for monetary damages the case is still in litigationcitation needed  ftc contempt of court actionedit the ftc filed a contempt of court action against trudeau and the companies that market the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about alleging that trudeau was in contempt of a  court order by deceptively claiming in his infomercials that the book being advertised establishes a weightloss protocol that is easy to follow the action was filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois on september   according to an ftc press release trudeau has claimed that the weight loss plan outlined in the book is easy can be done at home and readers can eat anything they want when consumers buy the book they find it describes a complex plan that requires intense dieting daily injections of a prescribed drug that is not easily obtainable and lifelong dietary restrictions on november   trudeau was found in contempt of the  court order for patently false claims in his weight loss book us district court judge robert w gettleman ruled that trudeau clearly misrepresents in his advertisements the difficulty of the diet described in his book and by doing so he has misled thousands of consumers on august   gettleman issued an order that trudeau was not to appear in infomercials for any product in which he has any interest for three years from the date of the order and was to pay a penalty of  an estimate of the royalties received from the weight loss book on november   gettleman amended the judgment to  the amount consumers paid in response to the deceptive infomercials the court denied trudeaus request to reconsider or stay this ruling on december  of the same year trudeau appealed the ruling to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit which upheld the contempt finding but sent the case back to the lower court to explain the basis of the  damage finding and the threeyear infomercial ban after the lower court justified the basis for the damage finding and set a  million performance bond for future infomercial advertising trudeau again appealed to the seventh circuit which affirmed the damage award on november    arrest on criminal contempt of court chargeedit on february   trudeau was arrested and appeared in us district court before gettleman for criminal contempt of court after he asked

could face future prison time for interfering with the direct process of the court on february  gettleman sentenced trudeau to  days in jail and forfeiture of the  bond wellknown critic of trudeau stephen barrett the creator of quackwatchorg has for years labeled trudeau a fraud and was quoted he struck me as somebody who believes he is omnipotent that is no one can touch him barrett said that’s almost been the case trudeau appealed the ruling and on may  the seventh circuit court of appeals granted his motion dismissing the contempt citation  loss of appeal against m fineedit on november   the us food and drug administration and the federal trade commission issued warnings to companies selling human chorionic gonadotropin hcg as weight loss products as the claims are unsupported the hcg diet was popularized by trudeaus the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about book in  on nov   trudeau lost his  appeal in the seventh circuit court of appeals the court found that the  million fine for violating his  settlement with the federal trade commission was appropriate as trudeau had aired  infomercials and described the figure as conservative the court considered sales only from the  number used to place orders and excluded internet and store sales additionally the court found that requiring trudeau to make a  million performance bond prior to participating in an infomercial was constitutional – additional contempt citations asset concealment imprisonmentedit in september  judge robert gettleman held trudeau in civil contempt for violation of multiple court orders and failure to pay the  million fine assessed in  noting that he continued to maintain a lavish lifestyle despite insisting that he had been “completely wiped out” financially gettleman appointed a receiver to identify and catalog trudeaus assets and holdings a month later trudeau was arrested after refusing to cooperate with the receivers investigation in november a jury found him in criminal contempt for repeated violations of his  agreement as well as subsequent orders and plea deals pending sentencing he was held without bail as a flight risk and for continued failure to disclose hidden assets in february  the courtappointed receiver announced that a number of trudeaus known assets including a home in ojai california would be auctioned with proceeds to be applied toward unpaid fines and restitutions the receiver also assumed control of trudeaus global information network gin the nevisbased secret club that had promised extraordinary secrets to success court officials informed gin members that the club’s business model “likely amounted to an illegal pyramid scheme and that its relentlessly publicized group of  billionaire financial advisors known as the “gin council” did not exist gins remaining assets were later auctioned as well in march  trudeau was sentenced to  years in prison an unusually lengthy term for a contempt conviction judge ronald guzman visibly irritated by trudeaus plea for leniency described him as deceitful to the core trudeau has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions  or at most impediments to be sidestepped outmaneuvered or just ignored guzman said that type of conduct simply cannot stand trudeau filed an appeal contending that a gettleman erred in ruling that trudeaus misrepresentations of the content of free money they dont want you to know about was in contempt of the court’s  order b that the district court abused its discretion when it ordered him to pay compensatory damages of  million and c further abused its discretion when it amended its  order to prohibit him from participating in infomercials promoting his books in february  a federal appeals court found no basis to accept trudeaus claims and ruled that the year sentence was reasonable given the size of trudeaus fraud and the flagrant and repetitive nature of his contumacious conduct trudeau is currently serving his sentence at the federal prison camp montgomery in alabama he maintains an active facebook page where he solicits donations for his defense fund and compares his imprisonment to that of nelson mandela in april  guzman ordered that royalties payable to trudeau from continuing sales of his books—now owned by a california company called free is my favorite llc which purchased the rights from trudeau—be forwarded to a governmentcontrolled trust and used for fine and restitution payments infomercials for free money they dont want you to know about produced and marketed by free is my favorite llc continue to run on television stations throughout the united states in october  gettleman approved a partial refund of about  million to more than  people who bought the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about other criticismsedit medical experienceedit one common criticism by consumer groups is that trudeau has had no medical training trudeau responds that by not having such training he is not biased toward pharmaceutical companies and the fda and that medical doctors are taught only how to write out prescriptions for poisons and cut out pieces of a persons anatomy unsubstantiated claimsedit trudeau has been criticized for his inability to provide evidence to back up his claims although he recites anecdotes he has never provided evidence evaluated by licensed medical practitioners in instances where trudeau has been asked to provide proof he has misinterpreted medical studies or cited dubious or fictitious studies for example trudeau cited a nonexistent year research study involving a natural cure for diabetes at the university of calgary when abc news correspondent jake tapper confronted him on nightline trudeau insisted that he had a copy of the study and would provide it he never did he later claimed in his infomercials that the university destroyed its findings to prevent reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry in  university of calgary officials announced in a public statement that none of trudeaus claims about the universitys research were true and that its attorneys had sent trudeau a cease and desist letter demanding that he stop associating himself with the school false endorsementsedit in august  the new york consumer protection board warned consumers that trudeau has used false claims of endorsements to promote his products noting that the back cover of natural cures includes false endorsements further the nycpb states that trudeaus television ads give the false impression that tammy faye messner opposes chemotherapy in favor of the natural cures in trudeaus book a representative for messner before her death from cancer said that was not true and that she was starting chemotherapy again the back cover includes the following quote from dr herbert ley a former commissioner of the us food and drug administration who died three years before the book was written the thing that bugs me is that people think the fda is protecting them it isnt what the fda is doing and what people think its doing are as different as night and day the statement extracted from a  new york times interview was made in the context of leys resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes trudeaus lawyer david j bradford says that this quote does not constitute a false endorsement of the book by ley but rather is merely a statement that is in line with the purpose of the book referencesedit  kevin trudeau banned from infomercials for three years ordered to pay more than  million for false claims about weightloss book

infomercial broadcasts throughout north america they promoted a range of products including health aids dietary supplements such as coral calcium baldness remedies addiction treatments

and misrepresentations in  he was fined in  he settled a contemptofcourt action arising out of the same cases by agreeing to a settlement that included both payment of a  million fine and a ban on further use of infomercials to promote any product other than publications protected by the first amendment in  trudeau began writing books and promoting them with infomercials in the us the first book he published was a medical guide titled natural cures they dont want you to know about which was published in  the book was criticized for containing no natural cures trudeau claimed that he was not able to include them because of threats by the ftc the book became a bestseller selling  million copies two years later trudeau published a second medical book titled more natural cures revealed previously censored brand name products that cure disease isbn  according to trudeau the book identifies brand name products that will cure myriad illnesses trudeaus books claim that animals in the wild rarely develop degenerative conditions like cancer or alzheimers disease and that many diseases are caused not by viruses or bacteria but rather by an imbalance in vital energy science writer christopher wanjek critiqued and rejected many of these claims in his july   livesciencecom health column trudeau went on to publish the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about and debt cures they dont want you to know about his writing has been commercially successful in september  natural cures was listed in the new york times as the numberoneselling nonfiction book in the united states for  weeks it has sold more than five million copies trudeau launched a selftitled internet radio talk show in february  which also aired on several small radio stations consisting of mostly brokered programming personal lifeedit trudeau has been married at least three times little is known about his first marriage to oleksandra polozhentseva a ukrainian immigrant his second union in  to kristine dorow a norwegian student whom he met in london ended in annulment after four months in  he married natalya babenko another ukrainian who currently runs several of his former companies she has returned to her home in kiev according to trudeau publicationsedit natural cures “they” don’t want you to know aboutedit in  trudeau selfpublished his book natural cures they dont want you to know about in which he made a number of unsubstantiated claims—for example that sunlight does not cause cancer sunscreen is one of the major causes of skin cancer and aids was a hoax devised as an excuse to stimulate medication usage trudeau further suggested—again without documentation—that various natural cures for serious illnesses including cancer herpes arthritis aids acid reflux disease various phobias depression obesity diabetes multiple sclerosis lupus chronic fatigue syndrome attention deficit disorder and muscular dystrophy had been deliberately hidden from the public by the food and drug administration the federal trade commission and the major food and drug companies in one widely quoted example he asserted that the university of calgary had developed a natural diabetes treatment then quashed its data fearing reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry a spokesman for the school told abc news that there have been no human studies conducted at the university of calgary in the past  years on herbal remedies for diabetes the university later sent trudeau a cease and desist letter ordering him to stop using its name rose shapiro cited natural cures as a prime example in her book suckers how alternative medicine makes fools of us all natural cures sold briskly due to an aggressive infomercial promotion quackwatch and other internet watchdog sites cautioned that the infomercial itself was misleading in a  public warning from the new york state consumer protection board cpb chairman teresa a santiago cautioned that natural cures contained no actual cures only “speculation” cures were promised but only by subscribing to trudeaus newsletter or website at  per year or  for a lifetime membership the paid sites contained only additional similarly unsubstantiated speculation according to the cpb the chicago tribune also noted that a purported backcover endorsement by former fda commissioner herbert ley—who died three years before the book was written—was actually an excerpt from a yearold new york times interview more natural cures revealededit following natural cures they don’t want you to know about trudeau released a second medical guide two years later his second book was selfpublished as well and titled more natural cures revealed previously censored brand name products that cure disease the book is a similar publication to his first where he purports to explain why drug and food companies hide the truth about how their products can cause disease in more natural cures revealed trudeau writes that workers at the fda and ftc want to censor him and figuratively burn his books though the book received negative comments from some reviewers it received average ratings on both amazon and goodreadscom the weight loss cure “they” dont want you to know aboutedit main article the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about in april  trudeau released the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about the book describes a weight loss plan originally proposed by british endocrinologist atw simeons in the s involving injections of human chorionic gonadotropin the diet was criticized in  by the journal of the american medical association as hazardous to human health and a waste of money in  the ftc ordered clinics and promoters of the simeons diet and hcg to inform prospective patients that there had not been substantial evidence to conclude hcg offered any benefit above that achieved on a restricted calorie diet clinical research trials published by the journal of the american medical association and the american journal of clinical nutrition have shown that hcg is ineffective as a weightloss aid citing no statistically significant difference in the means of the two groups and that hcg does not appear to enhance the effectiveness of a rigidly imposed regimen for weight reduction the ftc has filed a contemptofcourt action against trudeau alleging that the alleged misrepresentations in the book violate a  consent order debt cures “they” dont want you to know aboutedit debt cures was published in  and has been marketed on television chuck jaffee a columnist at cbs marketwatch stated truth be told most of the information in the book is readily available in personal finance columns you can find online or in books that are readily available in your local library trudeau says that if readers disagree with items on their credit reports they can dispute them as identity theft this was the magic cure of the books title trudeau sometimes mentions esteemed names throughout his books to extend himself credibility such as hazel valera executive director of the californiabased nonprofit organization clear credit exchange harvard law professor elizabeth warren and robert hinsley of consumers defense yet none of the mentioned were ever interviewed by trudeau your wish is your commandedit published in  the product says it gives tools on how to use the law of attraction to manifest readers desires the packaging also says it contains key links to using the law of attraction that are missing in other publications among the claims made in the related infomercial is trudeaus assertion to have virtually flunked out of high school he also says he was taken in by a mysterious group called the brotherhood that taught him the secrets that he is now widely announcing in his book there is also an invitation to join the now defunct global information network an exclusive group of highly influential affluent and freedomorientated sic people see below the network operated out of the caribbean island nevis and employed the law of attraction as its principal wealth generator a concept regarded by most in the scientific community as at best pseudoscience media interviewsedit trudeau has been interviewed by cnns paula zahn matt lauer of nbcs today show and harry smith of cbss the early show trudeau was also the subject of investigative reports done by inside edition abcs  and dateline nbc the  segment highlighted a nightline interview with jake tapper in which trudeau misrepresented the money he was forced to pay to the government the charges filed against him and the reason the government did not follow through with charges and claiming ignorance when the claims made in his book were called false by tapper trudeau was interviewed by jacques peretti for the fourth episode of the series the men who made us thin on bbc infomercialsedit at one time trudeau was a prolific producer of infomercials he consented to an ftc ban applying to everything except publications that the ftc concluded would infringe upon his first amendment rights all of his subsequent infomercials advertised his books natural cures they dont want you to know

unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately especially if potentially libelous or harmful november  learn how and when to remove this template message trudeau says that pharmaceutical companies dont want us to get well because curing disease is not nearly as profitable as treating it in perpetuity according to trudeau the corporate profit motive overrides the human desire to truly help people trudeau says that natural treatments cannot be patented and are not profitable enough to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars in testing so they will always lack fda approval trudeau uses herpes as an example saying that people with herpes must buy an expensive drug for the rest of their lives he says that if there were a cheap easy cure for herpes the fda and pharmaceutical companies would not want the population to know about it because corporate profits would suffer he cites the number of advertisements on television for prescription drugs and points out that prescription drugs should be advertised to doctors not to the general public he states in one infomercial that there are twelve known cures for cancer but that they are being kept from the general public by the fda the ftc and the pharmaceutical companies he also says that the fda and the ftc are two of the most corrupt organizations in america and that there is a long list of chemical ingredients that are secretly not required to be on the fda ingredients label that are damaging to human health trudeau offers a conspiracy theory saying that the drug industry and the fda work with each other to effectively deceive the public by banning allnatural cures in order to protect the profits of the drug industry trudeau says that fda commissioners who leave the fda to work for large drug companies are paid millions of dollars in any other industry according to trudeau this would be called bribery a conflict of interest or payoffs trudeau also says in his infomercials that the food industry includes chemicals such as msg and aspartame to get people addicted to food and to make people obese trudeau has also declared that he will lead a crusade against the fda and the ftc and will make an effort to sue companies who promote false claims in advertising such as leading pharmaceutical companies references to scientific studiesedit one of the major complaints about trudeaus infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies making them impossible to crosscheck for accuracy the same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence he presents in the infomercials he does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods for example he tells a story in an infomercial about a friend from england who came to his house and complained of heartburn he also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of st johns wort compared to two prescription medications these studies the informercials suggest are identified in the book being advertised for sale but none of his books provide any such substantiation in an interview he explained that he cannot reveal his source material because of ftc suppression but readers can join his web site where for  a month or  for a lifetime they can gain access to the special membersonly section from which they can email him for the information newspaper articlesedit a pair of  associated press articles by candice choi on the infomercials elaborated on the success and problems of the programs choi says that by repeatedly mentioning government sanctions against him trudeau anticipated any backlash with his cuckoo conspiracy theory and can partially deflect any criticism of him or his infomercials trudeaus use of the word cure is an issue for regulators also bookstores are polled on their decisions to sell or not sell a successful and controversial selfpublished book additional marketing venturesedit audio tapes “mega memory”edit trudeau says he adapted techniques used to improve the memory of the blind and the mentally challenged to create mega memory and advanced mega memory audio tapes his promotion of memoryenhancing products was ended by the intervention of the federal trade commission which alleged that the claims made by trudeau were false and programs involved would not enable users to achieve a photographic memory as the advertising claimed trudeau used research that dr michael van masters conducted with the state school for the blind in muskogee oklahoma in  as the basis of the mega memory products trudeau was selling automobiles at neponset lincoln mercury in the dorchester neighborhood of boston in  when he first met van masters shortly after meeting van masters trudeau joined van masters in the memory business in chicagocitation needed nonsurgical faceliftedit in addition to natural cures trudeau also hosted an infomercial that features the perfect lift nonsurgical facelift in the united kingdom this infomercial was found to violate the itc advertising rules in  trudeau began airing another infomercial for a product called firmalift with leigh valentine trudeau partners with donald barrett and itv directedit on september   donald barrett and itv direct a direct marketing company based in beverly massachusetts announced that they had partnered with trudeau to market both of his natural cures books trudeau also worked with itv to create itv ventures a new mlm group based out of itvs home office as of december  itv direct has pulled all information concerning both this partnership and trudeaus books from its corporate website however the infomercials continued to run as of april   international pool touredit ipt starship stage for tv rounds and finals at north american championship held in las vegas nevada july  main article international pool tour in  trudeau founded the international pool tour ipt his goal was to transform billiards into a major league sport with aggressive promotion and the largest purses ever offered the initial three events in  and early  were successful but at the fourth the ipt world open tournament in reno nevada promoters announced that they did not have sufficient funds on hand to cover the purse winners were assured that they would receive their prizes in small installments but most were never paid the reno fiasco marked the demise not only of ipt but of professional pool competitions as a whole as one commentator put it the pool hustler wasn’t murdered by any single suspect but the last man holding the knife was kevin trudeau legal proceedingsedit in connection with his promotional activities he has had a felony conviction and has been an unsuccessful defendant in several federal trade commission ftc lawsuits trudeau has been charged several times by agencies of the united states government for making claims without evidence in these cases trudeau signed a consent decree in which he did not plead guilty but did agree to stop making the claims and to pay a fine trudeau subsequently began to sell books which are protected by the first amendment trudeau was convicted of fraud and larceny in the early s the ftc has sued him repeatedly and keeps an extensive record of its conflicts with him a court order currently restricts his ability to promote and sell any product or service however he is permitted to promote books and other publications due to freespeech protection under the first amendment as long as they are not used to promote or sell products or services and do not contain misrepresentations on november   a court found trudeau in contempt of that court order for making deceptive claims about his book the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about in august  he was fined more than  million and banned from infomercials for three years for continuing to make fraudulent claims pertaining to the book the amount of the monetary damages was later increased to  million – larceny and credit card fraudedit in  trudeau posed as a doctor in order to deposit  in false checks and in  he pleaded guilty to larceny that same year trudeau faced federal charges of credit card fraud after he stole the names and social security numbers of eleven customers of a mega memory product and charged  on their credit cards he spent two years in federal prison because of this conviction later in an interview he explained his crimes as  youthful indiscretions and not as bad as they sound and besides both were partly the fault of other people and besides he has changed the larceny he explains as a series of math errors compounded by the mistake of a bank official as for why the bank thought he was a doctor that was just a simple misunderstanding because he jokingly referred to himself as a doctor in memory he still cant quite believe he was prosecuted for the larceny charges give me a break he says  sec and various statesedit trudeau began working for nutrition for life a multilevel marketing program in the mids in  his recruitment practices were cited by the states of illinois and michigan as well as the us securities and exchange commission illinois sued trudeau and jules leib his partner accusing them of operating an illegal pyramid scheme they settled with illinois and seven other states for  after agreeing to change their tactics michigan forbade him from operating in the state a class action lawsuit was filed by stockholders of nutrition for life for violations of texas law including misrepresenting andor omitting material information about nutrition for life international incs business in august  the company paid  million in cash to common stockholders and holders of warrants during the class period to settle the case the company also paid the plaintiffs attorney fees of   ftc fineedit in  trudeau was fined  the funds to be used for consumer redress by the ftc relating to six infomercials he had produced and in which the ftc determined he had made false or misleading claims these infomercials included hair farming mega memory system addiction breaking system action reading edens secret and mega reading the products included a hair farming system that was supposed to finally end baldness in the human race and a breakthrough that in  seconds can eliminate addictions discovered when a certain dr callahan was studying quantum physics  ftc contempt of court and injunctionedit in june  the ftc filed a complaint in the us district court for the northern district of illinois against trudeau and some of his companies shop america usa llc shop america marketing group llc and trustar global media limited alleging that diseaserelated claims for coral calcium supreme were false and unsubstantiated in july  trudeau entered into a stipulated preliminary injunction that prohibited him from continuing to make the challenged claims for coral calcium supreme and biotape in the summer of  the court found trudeau in contempt of court for violating the preliminary injunction because he had sent out a direct mail piece and produced an infomercial making prohibited claims the court ordered trudeau to cease all marketing for coral calcium products in september  trudeau agreed to pay  million  in cash plus transfer of residential property located in ojai california and a luxury vehicle to settle charges that he falsely claimed that a coral calcium product can cure cancer and other serious diseases and that a purported analgesic called biotape can permanently cure or relieve severe pain he also agreed to a lifetime ban on promoting products using infomercials but excluded restrictions to promote his books via infomercials trudeau was the only person ever banned by the ftc from selling a product via television lydia parnes speaking for the ftcs bureau of consumer protection stated this ban is meant to shut down an infomercial empire that has misled american consumers for years trudeau claimed the government was trying to discredit his book because he was exposing them  trudeau v ftcedit on february   trudeau filed a complaint against the ftc in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief trudeau also filed a motion for preliminary injunction which the court denied the complaint charged that the ftc had retaliated against him for his criticism of the agency by issuing a press release that falsely characterized and intentionally and deliberately misrepresented the  final order that conduct trudeau asserted exceeded the ftcs authority under  usc § f and violated the first amendment the ftc responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under rule b the district court granted the ftcs motion to dismiss first the court concluded that it lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction because the press release was not a final agency action under “section  of the administrative procedure act”  usc §  second the court held in the alternative that trudeau’s claims failed to state a viable cause of action as a matter of law trudeau later filed an appeal which was unsuccessful in reversing the courts ruling  trudeau v new york consumer protection boardedit trudeau filed a lawsuit on august   accusing the new york state consumer protection board of violating his first amendment rights by contacting television stations in new york state and urging them to pull trudeaus infomercials promoting his book natural cures they dont want you to know about trudeau won a temporary restraining order on september   prohibiting the board from sending letters to the television stations the temporary restraining order was replaced by a preliminary injunction however trudeau lost a motion to have the board send a corrective letter to the television stations and subsequently dropped all claims for monetary damages the case is still in litigationcitation needed  ftc contempt of court actionedit the ftc filed a contempt of court action against trudeau and the companies that market the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about alleging that trudeau was in contempt of a  court order by deceptively claiming in his infomercials that the book being advertised establishes a weightloss protocol that is easy to follow the action was filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois on september   according to an ftc press release trudeau has claimed that the weight loss plan outlined in the book is easy can be done at home and readers can eat anything they want when consumers buy the book they find it describes a complex plan that requires intense dieting daily injections of a prescribed drug that is not easily obtainable and lifelong dietary restrictions on november   trudeau was found in contempt of the  court order for patently false claims in his weight loss book us district court judge robert w gettleman ruled that trudeau clearly misrepresents in his advertisements the difficulty of the diet described in his book and by doing so he has misled thousands of consumers on august   gettleman issued an order that trudeau was not to appear in infomercials for any product in which he has any interest for three years from the date of the order and was to pay a penalty of  an estimate of the royalties received from the weight loss book on november   gettleman amended the judgment to  the amount consumers paid in response to the deceptive infomercials the court denied trudeaus request to reconsider or stay this ruling on december  of the same year trudeau appealed the ruling to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit which upheld the contempt finding but sent the case back to the lower court to explain the basis of the  damage finding and the threeyear infomercial ban after the lower court justified the basis for the damage finding and set a  million performance bond for future infomercial advertising trudeau again appealed to the seventh circuit which affirmed the damage award on november    arrest on criminal contempt of court chargeedit on february   trudeau was arrested and appeared in us district court before gettleman for criminal contempt of court after he asked his supporters to email the federal judge overseeing a pending civil case brought against him by the federal trade commission he was forced to turn over his passport pay a  bond and was warned he could face future prison time for interfering with the direct process of the court on february  gettleman sentenced trudeau to  days in jail and forfeiture of the  bond wellknown critic of trudeau stephen barrett the creator of quackwatchorg has for years labeled trudeau a fraud and was quoted he struck me as somebody who believes he is omnipotent that is no one can touch him barrett said that’s almost been the case trudeau appealed the ruling and on may  the seventh circuit court of appeals granted his motion dismissing the contempt citation  loss of appeal against m fineedit on november   the us food and drug administration and the federal trade commission issued warnings to companies selling human chorionic gonadotropin hcg as weight loss products as the claims are unsupported the hcg diet was popularized by trudeaus the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about book in  on nov   trudeau lost his  appeal in the seventh circuit court of appeals the court found that the  million fine for violating his  settlement with the federal trade commission was appropriate as trudeau had aired  infomercials and described the figure as conservative the court considered sales only from the  number used to place orders and excluded internet and store sales additionally the court found that requiring trudeau to make a  million performance bond prior to participating in an infomercial was constitutional – additional contempt citations asset concealment imprisonmentedit in september  judge robert gettleman held trudeau in civil contempt for violation of multiple court orders and failure to pay the  million fine assessed in  noting that he continued to maintain a lavish lifestyle despite insisting that he had been “completely wiped out” financially gettleman appointed a receiver to identify and catalog trudeaus assets and holdings a month later trudeau was arrested after refusing to cooperate with the receivers investigation in november a jury found him in criminal contempt for repeated violations of his  agreement as well as subsequent orders and plea deals pending sentencing he was held without bail as a flight risk and for continued failure to disclose hidden assets in february  the courtappointed receiver announced that a number of trudeaus known assets including a home in ojai california would be auctioned with proceeds to be applied toward unpaid fines and restitutions the receiver also assumed control of trudeaus global information network gin the nevisbased secret club that had promised extraordinary secrets to success court officials informed gin members that the club’s business model “likely amounted to an illegal pyramid scheme and that its relentlessly publicized group of  billionaire financial advisors known as the “gin council” did not exist gins remaining assets were later auctioned as well in march  trudeau was sentenced to  years in prison an unusually lengthy term for a contempt conviction judge ronald guzman visibly irritated by trudeaus plea for leniency described him as deceitful to the core trudeau has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions  or at most impediments to be sidestepped outmaneuvered or just ignored guzman said that type of conduct simply cannot stand trudeau filed an appeal contending that a gettleman erred in ruling that trudeaus misrepresentations of the content of free money they dont want you to know about was in contempt of the court’s  order b that the district court abused its discretion when it ordered him to pay compensatory damages of  million and c further abused its discretion when it amended its  order to prohibit him from participating in infomercials promoting his books in february  a federal appeals court found no basis to accept trudeaus claims and ruled that the year sentence was reasonable given the size of trudeaus fraud and the flagrant and repetitive nature of his contumacious conduct trudeau is currently serving his sentence at the federal prison camp montgomery in alabama he maintains an active facebook page where he solicits donations for his defense fund and compares his imprisonment to that of nelson mandela in april  guzman ordered that royalties payable to trudeau from continuing sales of his books—now owned by a california company called free is my favorite llc which purchased the rights from trudeau—be forwarded to a governmentcontrolled trust and used for fine and restitution payments infomercials for free money they dont want you to know about produced and marketed by free is my favorite llc continue to run on television stations throughout the united states in october  gettleman approved a partial refund of about  million to more than  people who bought the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about other criticismsedit medical experienceedit one common criticism by consumer groups is that trudeau has had no medical training trudeau responds that by not having such training he is not biased toward pharmaceutical companies and the fda and that medical doctors are taught only how to write out prescriptions for poisons and cut out pieces of a persons anatomy unsubstantiated claimsedit trudeau has been criticized for his inability to provide evidence to back up his claims although he recites anecdotes he has never provided evidence evaluated by licensed medical practitioners in instances where trudeau has been asked to provide proof he has misinterpreted medical studies or cited dubious or fictitious studies for example trudeau cited a nonexistent year research study involving a natural cure for diabetes at the university of calgary when abc news correspondent jake tapper confronted him on nightline trudeau insisted that he had a copy of the study and would provide it he never did he later claimed in his infomercials that the university destroyed its findings to prevent reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry in  university of calgary officials announced in a public statement that none of trudeaus claims about the universitys research were true and that its attorneys had sent trudeau a cease and desist letter demanding that he stop associating himself with the school false endorsementsedit in august  the new york consumer protection board warned consumers that trudeau has used false claims of endorsements to promote his products noting that the back cover of natural cures includes false endorsements further the nycpb states that trudeaus television ads give the false impression that tammy faye messner opposes chemotherapy in favor of the natural cures in trudeaus book a representative for messner before her death from cancer said that was not true and that she was starting chemotherapy again the back cover includes the following quote from dr herbert ley a former commissioner of the us food and drug administration who died three years before the book was written the thing that bugs me is that people think the fda is protecting them it isnt what the fda is doing and what people think its doing are as different as night and day the statement extracted from a  new york times interview was made in the context of leys resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes trudeaus lawyer david j bradford says that this quote does not constitute a false endorsement of the book by ley but rather is merely a statement that is in line with the purpose of the book referencesedit  kevin trudeau banned from infomercials for three years ordered to pay more than  million for false claims about weightloss book

claims—for example that sunlight does not cause cancer sunscreen is one of the major causes of skin cancer and aids was a hoax devised as an excuse to stimulate medication usage trudeau further suggested—again without documentation—that various natural cures for serious illnesses including cancer herpes arthritis aids acid reflux disease various phobias depression obesity diabetes multiple sclerosis lupus chronic fatigue syndrome attention deficit disorder and muscular dystrophy had been deliberately hidden from the public by the food and drug administration the federal trade commission and the major food and drug companies in one widely quoted example he asserted that the university of calgary had developed a natural diabetes treatment then quashed its data fearing reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry a spokesman for the school told abc news that there have been no human studies conducted at the university of calgary in the past  years on herbal remedies for diabetes the university later sent trudeau a cease and desist letter ordering him to stop using its name rose shapiro cited natural cures as a prime example in her book suckers how alternative medicine makes fools of us all natural cures sold briskly due to an aggressive infomercial promotion quackwatch and other internet watchdog sites cautioned that the infomercial itself was misleading in a  public warning from the new york state consumer protection board cpb chairman teresa a santiago cautioned that natural cures contained no actual cures only “speculation” cures were promised but only by subscribing to trudeaus newsletter or website at  per year or  for a lifetime membership the paid sites contained only additional similarly unsubstantiated speculation according to the cpb the chicago tribune also noted that a purported backcover endorsement by former fda commissioner herbert ley—who died three years before the book was written—was actually an excerpt from a yearold new york times

book received negative comments from some reviewers it received average ratings on both amazon and goodreadscom the weight loss cure “they” dont want you to know aboutedit main article the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about in april  trudeau released the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about the book describes a weight loss plan originally proposed by british endocrinologist atw simeons in the s involving injections of human chorionic gonadotropin the diet was criticized in  by the journal of the american medical association as hazardous to human health and a waste of money in  the ftc ordered clinics and promoters of the simeons diet and hcg to inform prospective patients that there had not been substantial evidence to conclude hcg offered any benefit above that achieved on a restricted calorie diet clinical research trials published by the journal of the american medical association and the american journal of clinical nutrition have shown that hcg is ineffective as a weightloss aid citing no statistically significant difference in the means of the two groups and that hcg does not appear to enhance the effectiveness of a rigidly imposed regimen for weight reduction the ftc has filed a contemptofcourt action against trudeau alleging that the alleged misrepresentations in the book violate a  consent order debt cures “they” dont want you to know aboutedit debt cures was published in  and has been marketed on television chuck jaffee a columnist at cbs marketwatch stated truth be told most of the information in the book is readily available in personal finance columns you can find online or in books that are readily available in your local library trudeau says that if readers disagree with items on their credit reports they can dispute them as identity theft this was the magic cure of the books title trudeau sometimes mentions esteemed names throughout his books to extend himself credibility such as hazel valera executive director of the californiabased nonprofit organization clear credit exchange harvard law professor elizabeth warren and robert hinsley of consumers defense yet none of the mentioned were ever interviewed by trudeau your wish is your commandedit published in  the product says it gives tools on how to use the law of attraction to manifest readers desires the packaging also says it contains key links to using the law of attraction that are missing in other publications among the claims made in the related infomercial is trudeaus assertion to have virtually flunked out of high school he also says he was taken in by a mysterious group called the brotherhood that taught him the secrets that he is now widely announcing in his book there is also an invitation to join the now defunct global information network an exclusive group of highly influential affluent and freedomorientated sic people see below the network operated out of the caribbean island nevis and employed the law of attraction as its principal wealth generator a concept regarded by most in the scientific community as at best pseudoscience media interviewsedit trudeau has been interviewed by cnns paula zahn matt lauer of nbcs today show and harry smith of cbss the early show trudeau was also the subject of investigative reports done by inside edition abcs  and dateline nbc the  segment highlighted a nightline interview with jake tapper in which trudeau misrepresented the money he was forced to pay to the government the charges filed against him and the reason the government did not follow through with charges and claiming ignorance when the claims made in his book were called false by tapper trudeau was interviewed by jacques peretti for the fourth episode of the series the men who made us thin on bbc infomercialsedit at one time trudeau was a prolific producer of infomercials he consented to an ftc ban applying to everything except publications that the ftc concluded would infringe upon his first amendment rights all of his subsequent infomercials advertised his books natural cures they dont want you to know about and the weight loss cure notable cohosts included leigh valentine former

for verification please help by adding reliable sources contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately especially if potentially libelous or harmful november  learn how and when to remove this template message trudeau says that pharmaceutical companies dont want us to get well because curing disease is not nearly as profitable as treating it in perpetuity according to trudeau the corporate profit motive overrides the human desire to truly help people trudeau says that natural treatments cannot be patented and are not profitable enough to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars in testing so they will always lack fda approval trudeau uses herpes as an example saying that people with herpes must buy an expensive drug for the rest of their lives he says that if there were a cheap easy cure for herpes the fda and pharmaceutical companies would not want the population to know about it because corporate profits would suffer he cites the number of advertisements on television for prescription drugs and points out that prescription drugs should be advertised to doctors not to the general public he states in one infomercial that there are twelve known cures for cancer but that they are being kept from the general public by the fda the ftc and the pharmaceutical companies he also says that the fda and the ftc are two of the most corrupt organizations in america and that there is a long list of chemical ingredients that are secretly not required to be on the fda ingredients label that are damaging to human health trudeau offers a conspiracy theory saying that the drug industry and the fda work with each other to effectively deceive the public by banning allnatural cures in order to protect the profits of the drug industry trudeau says that fda commissioners who leave the fda to work for large drug companies are paid millions of dollars in any other industry according to trudeau this would be called bribery a conflict of interest or payoffs trudeau also says in his infomercials that the food industry includes chemicals such as msg and aspartame to get people addicted to food and to make people obese trudeau has also declared that he will lead a crusade against the fda and the ftc and will make an effort to sue companies who promote false claims in advertising such as leading pharmaceutical companies references to scientific studiesedit one of the major complaints about trudeaus infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies making them impossible to crosscheck for accuracy the same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence he presents in the infomercials he does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods for example he tells a story in an infomercial about a friend from england who came to his house and complained of heartburn he also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of st johns wort compared to two prescription medications these studies the informercials suggest are identified in the book being advertised for sale but none of his books provide any such substantiation in an interview he explained that he cannot reveal his source material because of ftc suppression but readers can join his web site where for  a month or  for a lifetime they can gain access to the special membersonly section from which they can email him for the information newspaper articlesedit a pair of  associated press articles by candice choi on the infomercials elaborated on the success and problems of the programs choi says that by repeatedly mentioning government sanctions against him trudeau anticipated any backlash with his cuckoo conspiracy theory and can partially deflect any criticism of him or his infomercials trudeaus use of the word cure is an issue for regulators also bookstores are polled on their decisions to sell or not sell a successful and controversial selfpublished book additional marketing venturesedit audio tapes “mega memory”edit trudeau says he adapted techniques used to improve the memory of the blind and the mentally challenged to create mega memory and advanced mega memory audio tapes his promotion of memoryenhancing products was ended by the intervention of the federal trade commission which alleged that the claims made by trudeau were false and programs involved would not enable users to achieve a photographic memory as the advertising claimed trudeau used research that dr michael van masters conducted with the state school for the blind in muskogee oklahoma in  as the basis of the mega memory products trudeau was selling automobiles at neponset lincoln mercury in the dorchester neighborhood of boston in  when he first met van masters shortly after meeting van masters trudeau joined van masters in the memory business in chicagocitation needed nonsurgical faceliftedit in addition to natural cures trudeau also hosted an infomercial that

world open tournament in reno nevada promoters announced that they did not have sufficient funds on hand to cover the purse winners were assured that they would receive their prizes in small installments but most were never paid the reno fiasco marked the demise not only of ipt but of professional pool competitions as a whole as one commentator put it the pool hustler wasn’t murdered by any single suspect but the last man holding the knife was kevin trudeau legal proceedingsedit in connection with his promotional activities he has had a felony conviction and has been an unsuccessful defendant in several federal trade commission ftc lawsuits trudeau has been charged several times by agencies of the united states government for making claims without evidence in these cases trudeau signed a consent decree in which he did not plead guilty but did agree to stop making the claims and to pay a fine trudeau subsequently began to sell books which are protected by the first amendment trudeau was convicted of fraud and larceny in the early s the ftc has sued him repeatedly and keeps an extensive record of its conflicts with him a court order currently restricts his ability to promote and sell any product or service however he is permitted to promote books and other publications due to freespeech protection under the first amendment as long as they are not used to promote

same year trudeau faced federal charges of credit card fraud after he stole the names and social security numbers of eleven customers of a mega memory product and charged  on their credit cards he spent two years in federal prison because of this conviction later in an interview he explained his crimes as  youthful indiscretions and not as bad as they sound and besides both were partly the fault of other people and besides he has changed the larceny he explains as a series of math errors compounded by the mistake of a bank official as for why the bank thought he was a doctor that was just a simple misunderstanding because he jokingly referred to himself as a doctor in memory he still cant quite believe he was prosecuted for the larceny charges give me a break he says  sec and various statesedit trudeau began working for nutrition for life a multilevel marketing program in the mids in  his recruitment practices were cited by the states of illinois and michigan as well as

district of illinois against trudeau and some of his companies shop america usa llc shop america marketing group llc and trustar global media limited alleging that diseaserelated claims for coral calcium supreme were false and unsubstantiated in july  trudeau entered into a stipulated preliminary injunction that prohibited him from continuing to make the challenged claims for coral calcium supreme and biotape in the summer of  the court found trudeau in contempt of court for violating the preliminary injunction because he had sent out a direct mail piece and produced an infomercial making prohibited claims the court ordered trudeau to cease all marketing for coral calcium products in september  trudeau agreed to pay  million  in cash plus transfer of residential property located in ojai california and a luxury vehicle to settle charges that he falsely claimed that a coral calcium product can cure cancer and other serious diseases and that a purported analgesic called biotape

only person ever banned by the ftc from selling a product via television lydia parnes speaking for the ftcs bureau of consumer protection stated this ban is meant to shut down an infomercial empire that has misled american consumers for years trudeau claimed the government was trying to discredit his book because he was exposing them  trudeau v ftcedit on february   trudeau filed a complaint against the ftc in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief trudeau also filed a motion for preliminary injunction which the court denied the complaint charged that the ftc had retaliated against him for his criticism of the agency by issuing a press release that falsely characterized and intentionally and deliberately misrepresented the  final order that conduct trudeau asserted exceeded the ftcs authority under  usc § f and violated the first amendment the ftc responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under rule b the district court granted the ftcs motion to dismiss first the court concluded that it lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction because the press release was not a final agency action under “section  of the administrative procedure act”  usc §  second the court held in the alternative that trudeau’s claims failed to state a viable cause of action as a matter of law trudeau later filed an appeal which was unsuccessful in reversing the courts ruling  trudeau v new york consumer protection boardedit trudeau filed a lawsuit on august   accusing the new york state consumer protection board of violating his first amendment rights by contacting television stations in new york state and urging them to pull trudeaus infomercials promoting his book natural cures they dont want you to know about trudeau won a temporary restraining order on september   prohibiting the board from sending letters to the television stations the temporary restraining order was replaced by a preliminary injunction however trudeau lost a motion to have the board send a corrective letter to the television stations and subsequently dropped all claims for monetary damages the case is still in litigationcitation needed  ftc contempt of court actionedit the ftc filed a contempt of court action against trudeau and the companies that market the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about alleging that trudeau was in contempt of a  court order by deceptively claiming in his infomercials that the book being advertised establishes a weightloss protocol that is easy to follow the action was filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois on september   according to an ftc press release trudeau has claimed that the weight loss plan outlined in the book is easy can be done at home and readers can eat anything they want when consumers buy the book they find it describes a complex plan that requires intense dieting daily injections of a prescribed drug that is not easily obtainable and lifelong dietary restrictions on november   trudeau was found in contempt of the  court order for patently false claims in his weight loss book us district court judge robert w gettleman ruled that trudeau clearly misrepresents in his advertisements the difficulty of the diet described in his book and by doing so he has misled thousands of consumers on august   gettleman issued an order that trudeau was not to appear in infomercials for any product in which he has any interest for three years from the date of the order and was to pay a penalty of  an estimate of the royalties received from the weight loss book on november   gettleman amended the judgment to  the amount consumers paid in response to the deceptive infomercials the court denied trudeaus request to reconsider or stay this ruling on december  of the same year trudeau appealed the ruling to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit which upheld the contempt finding but sent the case back to the lower court to explain the basis of the  damage finding and the threeyear infomercial ban after the lower court justified the basis for the damage finding and set a  million performance bond for future infomercial advertising trudeau again appealed to the seventh circuit which affirmed the damage award on november    arrest on criminal contempt of court chargeedit on february   trudeau was arrested and appeared in us district court before gettleman for criminal contempt of court after he asked his supporters to email the federal judge overseeing a pending civil case brought against him by the federal trade commission he was forced to turn over his passport pay a  bond and was warned he could face future prison time for interfering with the direct process of the court on february  gettleman sentenced trudeau to  days in jail and forfeiture of the  bond wellknown critic of trudeau stephen barrett the creator of quackwatchorg has for years labeled trudeau a fraud and was quoted he struck me as somebody who believes he is omnipotent that is no one can touch him barrett said that’s almost been the case trudeau appealed the ruling and on may  the seventh circuit court of appeals granted his motion dismissing the contempt citation  loss of appeal against m fineedit on november   the us food and drug administration and the federal trade commission issued warnings to companies selling human chorionic gonadotropin hcg as weight loss products as the claims are unsupported the hcg diet was popularized by trudeaus the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about book in  on nov   trudeau lost his  appeal in the seventh circuit court of appeals the court found that the  million fine for violating his  settlement with the federal trade commission was appropriate as trudeau had aired  infomercials and described the figure as conservative the court considered sales only from the  number used to place orders and excluded internet and store sales additionally the court found that requiring trudeau to make a  million performance bond prior to participating in an infomercial was constitutional – additional contempt citations asset concealment imprisonmentedit in september  judge robert gettleman held trudeau in civil contempt for violation of multiple court orders and failure to pay the  million fine assessed in  noting that he continued to maintain a lavish lifestyle despite insisting that he had been “completely wiped out” financially gettleman appointed a receiver to identify and catalog trudeaus assets and holdings a month later trudeau was arrested after refusing to cooperate with the receivers investigation in november a jury found him in criminal contempt for repeated violations of his  agreement as well as subsequent orders and plea deals pending sentencing he was held without bail as a flight risk and for continued failure to disclose hidden assets in february  the courtappointed receiver announced that a number of trudeaus known assets including a home in ojai california would be auctioned with proceeds to be applied toward unpaid fines and restitutions the receiver also assumed control of trudeaus global information network gin the nevisbased secret club that had promised extraordinary secrets to success court officials informed gin members that the club’s business model “likely amounted to an illegal pyramid scheme and that its relentlessly publicized group of  billionaire financial advisors known as the “gin council” did not exist gins remaining assets were later auctioned as well in march  trudeau was sentenced to  years in prison an unusually lengthy term for a contempt conviction judge ronald guzman visibly irritated by trudeaus plea for leniency described him as deceitful to the core trudeau has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions  or at most impediments to be sidestepped outmaneuvered or just ignored guzman said that type of conduct simply cannot stand trudeau filed an appeal contending that a gettleman erred in ruling that trudeaus misrepresentations of the content of free money they dont want you to know about was in contempt of the court’s  order b that the district court abused its discretion when it ordered him to pay compensatory damages of  million and c further abused its discretion when it amended its  order to prohibit him from participating in infomercials promoting his books in february  a federal appeals court found no basis to accept trudeaus claims and ruled that the year sentence was reasonable given the size of trudeaus fraud and the flagrant and repetitive nature of his contumacious conduct trudeau is currently serving his sentence at the federal prison camp montgomery in alabama he maintains an active facebook page where he solicits donations for his defense fund and compares his imprisonment to that of nelson mandela in april  guzman ordered that royalties payable to trudeau from continuing sales of his books—now owned by a california company called free is my favorite llc which purchased the rights from trudeau—be forwarded to a governmentcontrolled trust and used for fine and restitution payments infomercials for free money they dont want you to know about produced and marketed by free is my favorite llc continue to run on television stations throughout the united states in october  gettleman approved a partial refund of about  million to more than  people who bought the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about other criticismsedit medical experienceedit one common criticism by consumer groups is that trudeau has had no medical training trudeau responds that by not having such training he is not biased toward pharmaceutical companies and the fda and that medical doctors are taught only how to write out prescriptions for poisons and cut out pieces of a persons anatomy unsubstantiated claimsedit trudeau has been criticized for his inability to provide evidence to back up his claims although he recites anecdotes he has never provided evidence evaluated by licensed medical practitioners in instances where trudeau has been asked to provide proof he has misinterpreted medical studies or cited dubious or fictitious studies for example trudeau cited a nonexistent year research study involving a natural cure for diabetes at the university of calgary when abc news correspondent jake tapper confronted him on nightline trudeau insisted that he had a copy of the study and would provide it he never did he later claimed in his infomercials that the university destroyed its findings to prevent reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry in  university of calgary officials announced in a public statement that none of trudeaus claims about the universitys research were true and that its attorneys had sent trudeau a cease and desist letter demanding that he stop associating himself with the school false endorsementsedit in august  the new york consumer protection board warned consumers that trudeau has used false claims of endorsements to promote his products noting that the back cover of natural cures includes false endorsements further the nycpb states that trudeaus television ads give the false impression that tammy faye messner opposes chemotherapy in favor of the natural cures in trudeaus book a representative for messner before her death from cancer said that was not true and that she was starting chemotherapy again the back cover includes the following quote from dr herbert ley a former commissioner of the us food and drug administration who died three years before the book was written the thing that bugs me is that people think the fda is protecting them it isnt what the fda is doing and what people think its doing are as different as night and day the statement extracted from a  new york times interview was made in the context of leys resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes trudeaus lawyer david j bradford says that this quote does not constitute a false endorsement of the book by ley but rather is merely a statement that is in line with the purpose of the book referencesedit  kevin trudeau banned from infomercials for three years

in  the book was criticized for containing no natural cures trudeau claimed that he was not able to include them because of threats by the ftc the book became a bestseller selling  million copies two years later trudeau published a second medical book titled more natural cures revealed previously censored brand name products that cure disease isbn  according to trudeau the book identifies brand name products that will cure myriad illnesses trudeaus books claim that animals in the wild rarely develop degenerative conditions like cancer or alzheimers disease and that many diseases are caused not by viruses or bacteria but rather by an imbalance in vital energy science writer christopher wanjek critiqued and rejected many of these claims in his july   livesciencecom health column trudeau went on to publish the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about and debt cures they dont want you to know about his writing has been commercially successful in september  natural cures was listed in the new york times as the numberoneselling nonfiction book in the united states for  weeks it has sold more than five million copies trudeau launched a selftitled internet radio talk show in

babenko another ukrainian who currently runs several of his former companies she has returned to her home in kiev according to trudeau publicationsedit natural cures “they” don’t want you to know aboutedit in  trudeau selfpublished his book natural cures they dont want you to know about in which he made a number of unsubstantiated claims—for example that sunlight does not cause cancer sunscreen is one of the major causes of skin cancer and aids was a hoax devised as an excuse to stimulate medication usage trudeau further suggested—again without documentation—that various natural cures for serious illnesses including cancer herpes arthritis aids acid reflux disease various phobias depression obesity diabetes multiple sclerosis lupus chronic fatigue syndrome attention deficit disorder and muscular dystrophy had been deliberately hidden from the public by the food and drug administration the federal trade commission and the major food and drug companies in one widely quoted example he asserted that the university of calgary had developed a natural diabetes treatment then quashed its data fearing reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry a spokesman for the school told abc news that there have been no human studies conducted at the university of calgary in the past  years on herbal remedies for diabetes the university later sent trudeau a cease and desist letter ordering him to stop using its name rose shapiro cited natural cures as a prime example in her book suckers how alternative medicine makes fools of us all natural cures sold briskly due to an aggressive infomercial promotion quackwatch and other internet watchdog sites cautioned that the infomercial itself was misleading in a  public warning from the new york state consumer protection board cpb chairman teresa a santiago cautioned that natural cures contained no actual cures only “speculation” cures were promised but only by subscribing to trudeaus newsletter or website at  per year or  for a lifetime membership the paid sites contained only additional similarly unsubstantiated speculation according to the cpb the chicago tribune also noted that a purported backcover endorsement by former fda commissioner herbert ley—who died three years before the book was written—was actually an excerpt from a yearold new york times interview more natural cures revealededit following natural cures they don’t want you to know about trudeau released a second medical guide two years later his second book was selfpublished as well and titled more natural cures revealed previously censored brand name products that cure disease the book is a similar publication to his first where he purports to explain why drug and food companies hide the truth about how their products can cause disease in more natural cures revealed trudeau writes that workers at the fda and ftc want to censor him and figuratively burn his books though the book received negative comments from some reviewers it received average ratings on both amazon and goodreadscom the weight loss cure “they” dont want you to know aboutedit main article the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about in april  trudeau released the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about the book describes a weight loss plan originally proposed by british endocrinologist atw simeons in the s involving injections of human chorionic gonadotropin the diet was criticized in  by the journal of the american medical association as hazardous to human health and a waste of money in  the ftc ordered clinics and promoters of the simeons diet and hcg to inform prospective patients that there had not been substantial evidence to conclude hcg offered any benefit above that achieved on a restricted calorie diet clinical research trials published by the journal of the american medical association and the american journal of clinical nutrition have shown that hcg is ineffective as a weightloss aid citing no statistically significant difference in the means of the two groups and that hcg does not appear to enhance the effectiveness of a rigidly imposed regimen for weight reduction the ftc has filed a contemptofcourt action against trudeau alleging that the alleged misrepresentations in the book violate a  consent order debt cures “they” dont want you to know aboutedit debt cures was published in  and has been marketed on television chuck jaffee a columnist at cbs marketwatch stated truth be told most of the information in the book is readily available in personal finance columns you can find online or in books that are readily available in your local library trudeau says that if readers disagree with items on their credit reports they can dispute them as identity theft this was the magic cure of the books title trudeau sometimes mentions esteemed names throughout his books to extend himself credibility such as hazel valera executive director of the californiabased nonprofit organization clear credit exchange harvard law professor elizabeth warren and robert hinsley of consumers defense yet none of the mentioned were ever interviewed by trudeau your wish is your commandedit published in  the product says it gives tools on how to use the law of attraction to manifest readers desires the packaging also says it contains key links to using the law of attraction that are missing in other publications among the claims made in the related infomercial is trudeaus assertion to have virtually flunked out of high school he also says he was taken in by a mysterious group called the brotherhood that taught him the secrets that he is now widely announcing in his book there is also an invitation to join the now defunct global information network an exclusive group of highly influential affluent and freedomorientated sic people see below the network operated out of the caribbean island nevis and employed the law of attraction as its principal wealth generator a concept regarded by most in the scientific community as at best pseudoscience media interviewsedit trudeau has been interviewed by cnns paula zahn matt lauer of nbcs today show and harry smith of cbss the early show trudeau was also the subject of investigative reports done by inside edition abcs  and dateline nbc the  segment highlighted a nightline interview with jake tapper in which trudeau misrepresented the money he was forced to pay to the government the charges filed against him and the reason the government did not follow through with charges and claiming ignorance when the claims made in his book were called false by tapper trudeau was interviewed by jacques peretti for the fourth episode of the series the men who made us thin on bbc infomercialsedit at one time trudeau was a prolific producer of infomercials he consented to an ftc ban applying to everything except publications that the ftc concluded would infringe upon his first amendment rights all of his subsequent infomercials advertised his books natural cures they dont want you to know about and the weight loss cure notable cohosts included leigh valentine former wife of televangelist robert tilton and the late tammy faye messner the former tammy faye bakker pharmaceutical companiesedit this section of a biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification please help by adding reliable sources contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately especially if potentially libelous or harmful november  learn how and when to remove this template message trudeau says that pharmaceutical companies dont want us to get well because curing disease is not nearly as profitable as treating it in perpetuity according to trudeau the corporate profit motive overrides the human desire to truly help people trudeau says that natural treatments cannot be patented and are not profitable enough to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars in testing so they will always lack fda approval trudeau uses herpes as an example saying that people with herpes must buy an expensive drug for the rest of their lives he says that if there were a cheap easy cure for herpes the fda and pharmaceutical companies would not want the population to know about it because corporate profits would suffer he cites the number of advertisements on television for prescription drugs and points out that prescription drugs should be advertised to doctors not to the general public he states in one infomercial that there are twelve known cures for cancer but that they are being kept from the general public by the fda the ftc and the pharmaceutical companies he also says that the fda and the ftc are two of the most corrupt organizations in america and that there is a long list of chemical ingredients that are secretly not required to be on the fda ingredients label that are damaging to human health trudeau offers a conspiracy theory saying that the drug industry and the fda work with each other to effectively deceive the public by banning allnatural cures in order to protect the profits of the drug industry trudeau says that fda commissioners who leave the fda to work for large drug companies are paid millions of dollars in any other industry according to trudeau this would be called bribery a conflict of interest or payoffs trudeau also says in his infomercials that the food industry includes chemicals such as msg and aspartame to get people addicted to food and to make people obese trudeau has also declared that he will lead a crusade against the fda and the ftc and will make an effort to sue companies who promote false claims in advertising such as leading pharmaceutical companies references to scientific studiesedit one of the major complaints about trudeaus infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies making them impossible to crosscheck for accuracy the same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence he presents in the infomercials he does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods for example he tells a story in an infomercial about a friend from england who came to his house and complained of heartburn he also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of st johns wort compared to two prescription medications these studies the informercials suggest are identified in the book being advertised for sale but none of his books provide any such substantiation in an interview he explained that he cannot reveal his source material because of ftc suppression but readers can join his web site where for  a month or  for a lifetime they can gain access to the special membersonly section from which they can email him for the information newspaper articlesedit a pair of  associated press articles by candice choi on the infomercials elaborated on the success and problems of the programs choi says that by repeatedly mentioning government sanctions against him trudeau anticipated any backlash with his cuckoo conspiracy theory and can partially deflect any criticism of him or his infomercials trudeaus use of the word cure is an issue for regulators also bookstores are polled on their decisions to sell or not sell a successful and controversial selfpublished book additional marketing venturesedit audio tapes “mega memory”edit trudeau says he adapted techniques used to improve the memory of the blind and the mentally challenged to create mega memory and advanced mega memory audio tapes his promotion of memoryenhancing products was ended by the intervention of the federal trade commission which alleged that the claims made by trudeau were false and programs involved would not enable users to achieve a photographic memory as the advertising claimed trudeau used research that dr michael van masters conducted with the state school for the blind in muskogee oklahoma in  as the basis of the mega memory products trudeau was selling automobiles at neponset lincoln mercury in the dorchester neighborhood of boston in  when he first met van masters shortly after meeting van masters trudeau joined van masters in the memory business in chicagocitation needed nonsurgical faceliftedit in addition to natural cures trudeau also hosted an infomercial that features the perfect lift nonsurgical facelift in the united kingdom this infomercial was found to violate the itc advertising rules in  trudeau began airing another infomercial for a product called firmalift with leigh valentine trudeau partners with donald barrett and itv directedit on september   donald barrett and itv direct a direct marketing company based in beverly massachusetts announced that they had partnered with trudeau to market both of his natural cures books trudeau also worked with itv to create itv ventures a new mlm group based out of itvs home office as of december  itv direct has pulled all information concerning both this partnership and trudeaus books from its corporate website however the infomercials continued to run as of april   international pool touredit ipt starship stage for tv rounds and finals at north american championship held in las vegas nevada july  main article international pool tour in  trudeau founded the international pool tour ipt his goal was to transform billiards into a major league sport with aggressive promotion and the largest purses ever offered the initial three events in  and early  were successful but at the fourth the ipt world open tournament in reno nevada promoters announced that they did not have sufficient funds on hand to cover the purse winners were assured that they would receive their prizes in small installments but most were never paid the reno fiasco marked the demise not only of ipt but of professional pool competitions as a whole as one commentator put it the pool hustler wasn’t murdered by any single suspect but the last man holding the knife was kevin trudeau legal proceedingsedit in connection with his promotional activities he has had a felony conviction and has been an unsuccessful defendant in several federal trade commission ftc lawsuits trudeau has been charged several times by agencies of the united states government for making claims without evidence in these cases trudeau signed a consent decree in which he did not plead guilty but did agree to stop making the claims and to pay a fine trudeau subsequently began to sell books which are protected by the first amendment trudeau was convicted of fraud and larceny in the early s the ftc has sued him repeatedly and keeps an extensive record of its conflicts with him a court order currently restricts his ability to promote and sell any product or service however he is permitted to promote books and other publications due to freespeech protection under the first amendment as long as they are not used to promote or sell products or services and do not contain misrepresentations on november   a court found trudeau in contempt of that court order for making deceptive claims about his book the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about in august  he was fined more than  million and banned from infomercials for three years for continuing to make fraudulent claims pertaining to the book the amount of the monetary damages was later increased to  million – larceny and credit card fraudedit in  trudeau posed as a doctor in order to deposit  in false checks and in  he pleaded guilty to larceny that same year trudeau faced federal charges of credit card fraud after he stole the names and social security numbers of eleven customers of a mega memory product and charged  on their credit cards he spent two years in federal prison because of this conviction later in an interview he explained his crimes as  youthful indiscretions and not as bad as they sound and besides both were partly the fault of other people and besides he has changed the larceny he explains as a series of math errors compounded by the mistake of a bank official as for why the bank thought he was a doctor that was just a simple misunderstanding because he jokingly referred to himself as a doctor in memory he still cant quite believe he was prosecuted for the larceny charges give me a break he says  sec and various statesedit trudeau began working for nutrition for life a multilevel marketing program in the mids in  his recruitment practices were cited by the states of illinois and michigan as well as the us securities and exchange commission illinois sued trudeau and jules leib his partner accusing them of operating an illegal pyramid scheme they settled with illinois and seven other states for  after agreeing to change their tactics michigan forbade him from operating in the state a class action lawsuit was filed by stockholders of nutrition for life for violations of texas law including misrepresenting andor omitting material information about nutrition for life international incs business in august  the company paid  million in cash to common stockholders and holders of warrants during the class period to settle the case the company also paid the plaintiffs attorney fees of   ftc fineedit in  trudeau was fined  the funds to be used for consumer redress by the ftc relating to six infomercials he had produced and in which the ftc determined he had made false or misleading claims these infomercials included hair farming mega memory system addiction breaking system action reading edens secret and mega reading the products included a hair farming system that was supposed to finally end baldness in the human race and a breakthrough that in  seconds can eliminate addictions discovered when a certain dr callahan was studying quantum physics  ftc contempt of court and injunctionedit in june  the ftc filed a complaint in the us district court for the northern district of illinois against trudeau and some of his companies shop america usa llc shop america marketing group llc and trustar global media limited alleging that diseaserelated claims for coral calcium supreme were false and unsubstantiated in july  trudeau entered into a stipulated preliminary injunction that prohibited him from continuing to make the challenged claims for coral calcium supreme and biotape in the summer of  the court found trudeau in contempt of court for violating the preliminary injunction because he had sent out a direct mail piece and produced an infomercial making prohibited claims the court ordered trudeau to cease all marketing for coral calcium products in september  trudeau agreed to pay  million  in cash plus transfer of residential property located in ojai california and a luxury vehicle to settle charges that he falsely claimed that a coral calcium product can cure cancer and other serious diseases and that a purported analgesic called biotape can permanently cure or relieve severe pain he also agreed to a lifetime ban on promoting products using infomercials but excluded restrictions to promote his books via infomercials trudeau was the only person ever banned by the ftc from selling a product via television lydia parnes speaking for the ftcs bureau of consumer protection stated this ban is meant to shut down an infomercial empire that has misled american consumers for years trudeau claimed the government was trying to discredit his book because he was exposing them  trudeau v ftcedit on february   trudeau filed a complaint against the ftc in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief trudeau also filed a motion for preliminary injunction which the court denied the complaint charged that the ftc had retaliated against him for his criticism of the agency by issuing a press release that falsely characterized and intentionally and deliberately misrepresented the  final order that conduct trudeau asserted exceeded the ftcs authority under  usc § f and violated the first amendment the ftc responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under rule b the district court granted the ftcs motion to dismiss first the court concluded that it lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction because the press release was not a final agency action under “section  of the administrative procedure act”  usc §  second the court held in the alternative that trudeau’s claims failed to state a viable cause of action as a matter of law trudeau later filed an appeal which was unsuccessful in reversing the courts ruling  trudeau v new york consumer protection boardedit trudeau filed a lawsuit on august   accusing the new york state consumer protection board of violating his first amendment rights by contacting television stations in new york state and urging them to pull trudeaus infomercials promoting his book natural cures they dont want you to know about trudeau won a temporary restraining order on september   prohibiting the board from sending letters to the television stations the temporary restraining order was replaced by a preliminary injunction however trudeau lost a motion to have the board send a corrective letter to the television stations and subsequently dropped all claims for monetary damages the case is still in litigationcitation needed  ftc contempt of court actionedit the ftc filed a contempt of court action against trudeau and the companies that market the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about alleging that trudeau was in contempt of a  court order by deceptively claiming in his infomercials that the book being advertised establishes a weightloss protocol that is easy to follow the action was filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois on september   according to an ftc press release trudeau has claimed that the weight loss plan outlined in the book is easy can be done at home and readers can eat anything they want when consumers buy the book they find it describes a complex plan that requires intense dieting daily injections of a prescribed drug that is not easily obtainable and lifelong dietary restrictions on november   trudeau was found in contempt of the  court order for patently false claims in his weight loss book us district court judge robert w gettleman ruled that trudeau clearly misrepresents in his advertisements the difficulty of the diet described in his book and by doing so he has misled thousands of consumers on august   gettleman issued an order that trudeau was not to appear in infomercials for any product in which he has any interest for three years from the date of the order and was to pay a penalty of  an estimate of the royalties received from the weight loss book on november   gettleman amended the judgment to  the amount consumers paid in response to the deceptive infomercials the court denied trudeaus request to reconsider or stay this ruling on december  of the same year trudeau appealed the ruling to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit which upheld the contempt finding but sent the case back to the lower court to explain the basis of the  damage finding and the threeyear infomercial ban after the lower court justified the basis for the damage finding and set a  million performance bond for future infomercial advertising trudeau again appealed to the seventh circuit which affirmed the damage award on november    arrest on criminal contempt of court chargeedit on february   trudeau was arrested and appeared in us district court before gettleman for criminal contempt of court after he asked his supporters to email the federal judge overseeing a pending civil case brought against him by the federal trade commission he was forced to turn over his passport pay a  bond and was warned he could face future prison time for interfering with the direct process of the court on february  gettleman sentenced trudeau to  days in jail and forfeiture of the  bond wellknown critic of trudeau stephen barrett the creator of quackwatchorg has for years labeled trudeau a fraud and was quoted he struck me as somebody who believes he is omnipotent that is no one can touch him barrett said that’s almost been the case trudeau appealed the ruling and on may  the seventh circuit court of appeals granted his motion dismissing the contempt citation  loss of appeal against m fineedit on november   the us food and drug administration and the federal trade commission issued warnings to companies selling human chorionic gonadotropin hcg as weight loss products as the claims are unsupported the hcg diet was popularized by trudeaus the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about book in  on nov   trudeau lost his  appeal in the seventh circuit court of appeals the court found that the  million fine for violating his  settlement with the federal trade commission was appropriate as trudeau had aired  infomercials and described the figure as conservative the court considered sales only from the  number used to place orders and excluded internet and store sales additionally the court found that requiring trudeau to make a  million performance bond prior to participating in an infomercial was constitutional – additional contempt citations asset concealment imprisonmentedit in september  judge robert gettleman held trudeau in civil contempt for violation of multiple court orders and failure to pay the  million fine assessed in  noting that he continued to maintain a lavish lifestyle despite insisting that he had been “completely wiped out” financially gettleman appointed a receiver to identify and catalog trudeaus assets and holdings a month later trudeau was arrested after refusing to cooperate with the receivers investigation in november a jury found him in criminal contempt for repeated violations of his  agreement as well as subsequent orders and plea deals pending sentencing he was held without bail as a flight risk and for continued failure to disclose hidden assets in february  the courtappointed receiver announced that a number of trudeaus known assets including a home in ojai california would be auctioned with proceeds to be applied toward unpaid fines and restitutions the receiver also assumed control of trudeaus global information network gin the nevisbased secret club that had promised extraordinary secrets to success court officials informed gin members that the club’s business model “likely amounted to an illegal pyramid scheme and that its relentlessly publicized group of  billionaire financial advisors known as the “gin council” did not exist gins remaining assets were later auctioned as well in march  trudeau was sentenced to  years in prison an unusually lengthy term for a contempt conviction judge ronald guzman visibly irritated by trudeaus plea for leniency described him as deceitful to the core trudeau has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions  or at most impediments to be sidestepped outmaneuvered or just ignored guzman said that type of conduct simply cannot stand trudeau filed an appeal contending that a gettleman erred in ruling that trudeaus misrepresentations of the content of free money they dont want you to know about was in contempt of the court’s  order b that the district court abused its discretion when it ordered him to pay compensatory damages of  million and c further abused its discretion when it amended its  order to prohibit him from participating in infomercials promoting his books in february  a federal appeals court found no basis to accept trudeaus claims and ruled that the year sentence was reasonable given the size of trudeaus fraud and the flagrant and repetitive nature of his contumacious conduct trudeau is currently serving his sentence at the federal prison camp montgomery in alabama he maintains an active facebook page where he solicits donations for his defense fund and compares his imprisonment to that of nelson mandela in april  guzman ordered that royalties payable to trudeau from continuing sales of his books—now owned by a california company called free is my favorite llc which purchased the rights from trudeau—be forwarded to a governmentcontrolled trust and used for fine and restitution payments infomercials for free money they dont want you to know about produced and marketed by free is my favorite llc continue to run on television stations throughout the united states in october  gettleman approved a partial refund of about  million to more than  people who bought the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about other criticismsedit medical experienceedit one common criticism by consumer groups is that trudeau has had no medical training trudeau responds that by not having such training he is not biased toward pharmaceutical companies and the fda and that medical doctors are taught only how to write out prescriptions for poisons and cut out pieces of a persons anatomy unsubstantiated claimsedit trudeau has been criticized for his inability to provide evidence to back up his claims although he recites anecdotes he has never provided evidence evaluated by licensed medical practitioners in instances where trudeau has been asked to provide proof he has misinterpreted medical studies or cited dubious or fictitious studies for example trudeau cited a nonexistent year research study involving a natural cure for diabetes at the university of calgary when abc news correspondent jake tapper confronted him on nightline trudeau insisted that he had a copy of the study and would provide it he never did he later claimed in his infomercials that the university destroyed its findings to prevent reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry in  university of calgary officials announced in a public statement that none of trudeaus claims about the universitys research were true and that its attorneys had sent trudeau a cease and desist letter demanding that he stop associating himself with the school false endorsementsedit in august  the new york consumer protection board warned consumers that trudeau has used false claims of endorsements to promote his products noting that the back cover of natural cures includes false endorsements further the nycpb states that trudeaus television ads give the false impression that tammy faye messner opposes chemotherapy in favor of the natural cures in trudeaus book a representative for messner before her death from cancer said that was not true and that she was starting chemotherapy again the back cover includes the following quote from dr herbert ley a former commissioner of the us food and drug administration who died three years before the book was written the thing that bugs me is that people think the fda is protecting them it isnt what the fda is doing and what people think its doing are as different as night and day the statement extracted from a  new york times interview was made in the context of leys resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes trudeaus lawyer david j bradford says that this quote does not constitute a false endorsement of the book by ley but rather is merely a statement that is in line with the purpose of the book referencesedit  kevin trudeau banned from infomercials for three years

about in which he made a number of unsubstantiated claims—for example that sunlight does not cause cancer sunscreen is one of the major causes of skin cancer and aids was a hoax devised as an excuse to stimulate medication usage trudeau further suggested—again without documentation—that various natural cures for serious illnesses including cancer herpes arthritis aids acid reflux disease various phobias depression obesity diabetes multiple sclerosis lupus chronic fatigue syndrome attention deficit disorder and muscular dystrophy had been deliberately hidden from the public by the food and drug administration the federal trade commission and the major food and drug companies in one widely quoted example he asserted that the university of calgary had developed a natural diabetes treatment then quashed its data fearing reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry a spokesman for the school told abc news that there have been no human studies conducted at the university of calgary

in her book suckers how alternative medicine makes fools of us all natural cures sold briskly due to an aggressive infomercial promotion quackwatch and other internet watchdog sites cautioned that the

“speculation” cures were promised but only by subscribing to trudeaus newsletter or website at  per year or  for a lifetime membership the paid sites contained only additional similarly unsubstantiated speculation according to the cpb the chicago tribune also noted that a purported backcover endorsement by former fda commissioner herbert ley—who died three years before the book was

describes a weight loss plan originally proposed by british endocrinologist atw simeons in the s involving injections of human chorionic gonadotropin the diet was criticized in  by the journal of the american medical association as hazardous to human health and a waste of money in  the ftc ordered clinics and promoters of the simeons diet and hcg to inform prospective patients that there had not been substantial evidence to conclude hcg offered any benefit above that achieved on a restricted calorie diet clinical research trials published by the journal of the american medical association and the american journal of clinical nutrition have shown that hcg is ineffective as a weightloss aid citing no statistically significant difference in the means of the two groups and that hcg does not appear to enhance the effectiveness of a rigidly imposed regimen for weight reduction the ftc has filed a contemptofcourt action against trudeau alleging that the alleged misrepresentations in the book violate a  consent order debt cures “they” dont want you to know aboutedit debt cures was published in  and has been marketed on television chuck jaffee a columnist at cbs marketwatch stated truth be told most of the information in the book is readily available in personal finance columns you can find online or in books that are readily available in your local library trudeau says that if readers disagree with items on their credit reports they can dispute them as identity theft this was the magic cure of the books title trudeau sometimes mentions esteemed names throughout his books to extend himself credibility such as hazel valera executive director of the californiabased nonprofit organization clear credit exchange harvard law professor elizabeth warren and robert hinsley of consumers defense yet none of the mentioned were ever interviewed by trudeau your wish is your commandedit published in  the product says it gives tools on how to use the law of attraction to manifest readers desires the packaging also says it contains key links to using the law of attraction that are missing in other publications among the claims made in the related infomercial is trudeaus assertion to have virtually flunked out of high school he also says he was taken in by a mysterious group called the brotherhood that taught him the secrets that he is now widely announcing in his book there is also an invitation to join the now defunct global information network an exclusive group of highly influential affluent and freedomorientated sic people see below the network operated out of the caribbean island nevis and employed the law of attraction as its principal wealth generator a concept regarded by most in the scientific community as at best pseudoscience media interviewsedit trudeau has been interviewed by cnns paula zahn matt lauer of nbcs today show and harry smith of cbss the early show trudeau was also the subject of investigative reports done by inside edition abcs  and dateline nbc the  segment highlighted a nightline interview with jake tapper in which trudeau misrepresented the money he was forced to pay to the government the charges filed against him and the reason the government did not follow through with charges and claiming ignorance when the claims made in his book were called false by tapper trudeau was interviewed by jacques peretti for the fourth episode of the series the men who made us thin on bbc infomercialsedit at one time trudeau was a prolific producer of infomercials he consented to an ftc ban applying to everything except publications that the ftc concluded would infringe upon his first amendment rights all of his subsequent infomercials advertised his books natural cures they dont want you to know about and the weight loss cure notable cohosts included leigh valentine former wife of televangelist robert tilton and the late tammy faye messner the former tammy faye bakker pharmaceutical companiesedit this section of a biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification please help by adding reliable sources contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately especially if potentially libelous or harmful november  learn how and when to remove this template message trudeau says that pharmaceutical companies dont want us to get well because curing disease is not nearly as profitable as treating it in perpetuity according to trudeau the corporate profit motive overrides the human desire to truly help people trudeau says that natural treatments cannot be patented and are not profitable enough to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars in testing so they will always lack fda approval trudeau uses herpes as an example saying that people with herpes must buy an expensive drug for the rest of their lives he says that if there were a cheap easy cure for herpes the fda and pharmaceutical companies would not want the population to know about it because corporate profits would suffer he cites the number of advertisements on television for prescription drugs and points out that prescription drugs should be advertised to doctors not to the general public he states in one infomercial that there are twelve known cures for cancer but that they are being kept from the general public by the fda the ftc and the pharmaceutical companies he also says that the fda and the ftc are two of the most corrupt organizations in america and that there is a long list of chemical ingredients that are secretly not required to be on the fda ingredients label that are damaging to human health trudeau offers a conspiracy theory saying that the drug industry and the fda work with each other to effectively deceive the public by banning allnatural cures in order to protect the profits of the drug industry trudeau says that fda commissioners who leave the fda to work for large drug companies are paid millions of dollars in any other industry according to trudeau this would be called bribery a conflict of interest or payoffs trudeau also says in his infomercials that the food industry includes chemicals such as msg and aspartame to get people addicted to food and to make people obese trudeau has also declared that he will lead a crusade against the fda and the ftc and will make an effort to sue companies who promote false claims in advertising such as leading pharmaceutical companies references to scientific studiesedit one of the major complaints about trudeaus infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies making them impossible to crosscheck for accuracy the same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence he presents in the infomercials he does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods for example he tells a story in an infomercial about a friend from england who came to his house and complained of heartburn he also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of st johns wort compared to two prescription medications these studies the informercials suggest are identified in the book being advertised for sale but none of his books provide any such substantiation in an interview he explained that he cannot reveal his source material because of ftc suppression but readers can join his web site where for  a month or  for a lifetime they can gain access to the special membersonly section from which they can email him for the information newspaper articlesedit a pair of  associated press articles by candice choi on the infomercials elaborated on the success and problems of the programs choi says that by repeatedly mentioning government sanctions against him trudeau anticipated any backlash with his cuckoo conspiracy theory and can partially deflect any criticism of him or his infomercials trudeaus use of the word cure is an issue for regulators also bookstores are polled on their decisions to sell or not sell a successful and controversial selfpublished book additional marketing venturesedit audio tapes “mega memory”edit trudeau says he adapted techniques used to improve the memory of the blind and the mentally challenged to create mega memory and advanced mega memory audio tapes his promotion of memoryenhancing products was ended by the intervention of the federal trade commission which alleged that the claims made by trudeau were false and programs involved would not enable users to achieve a photographic memory as the advertising claimed trudeau used research that dr michael van masters conducted with the state school for the blind in muskogee oklahoma in  as the basis of the mega memory products trudeau was selling automobiles at neponset lincoln mercury in the dorchester neighborhood of boston in  when he first met van masters shortly after meeting van masters trudeau joined van masters in the memory business in chicagocitation needed nonsurgical faceliftedit in addition to natural cures trudeau also hosted an infomercial that features the perfect lift nonsurgical facelift in the united kingdom this

directedit on september   donald barrett and itv direct a direct marketing company based in beverly massachusetts announced that they had partnered with trudeau to market both of his natural cures books trudeau also worked with itv to create itv ventures a new mlm group based out of itvs home office as of december  itv direct has pulled all information concerning both this partnership and trudeaus books from its corporate website however the infomercials continued to run as of april   international pool touredit ipt starship stage for tv rounds and finals at north american championship

promotion and the largest purses ever offered the initial three events in  and early  were successful but at the fourth the ipt world open tournament in reno nevada promoters announced that they did not have sufficient funds on hand to cover the purse winners were assured that they would receive their prizes in small installments but most were never paid the reno fiasco marked the demise not only of ipt but of professional pool competitions as a whole as one commentator put it the pool hustler wasn’t murdered by any single suspect but the last man holding the knife was kevin trudeau legal proceedingsedit in connection with his promotional activities he has had a felony conviction and has been an unsuccessful defendant in several federal trade commission ftc lawsuits trudeau has been charged several times by agencies of the united states government for making claims without evidence in these cases trudeau signed a consent decree in which he did not plead guilty but did agree to stop making the claims and to pay a fine trudeau subsequently began to sell books which are protected by the first amendment trudeau was convicted of fraud and larceny in the early s the ftc has sued him repeatedly and keeps an extensive record of its conflicts with him a court order currently restricts his ability to promote and sell any product or service however he is permitted to promote books and other publications due to freespeech protection under the first amendment as long as they are not used to promote or sell products or services and do not contain misrepresentations on november   a court found trudeau in contempt of that court order for making deceptive claims about his book the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about in august  he was fined more than  million and banned from infomercials for three years for continuing to make fraudulent claims pertaining to the book the amount of the monetary damages was later increased to  million – larceny and credit card fraudedit in  trudeau posed as a doctor in order to deposit  in false checks and in  he pleaded guilty to larceny that same year trudeau faced federal charges of credit card fraud after he stole the names and social security numbers of eleven customers of a mega memory product and charged  on their credit cards he spent two years in federal prison because of this conviction later in an interview he explained his crimes as  youthful indiscretions and not as bad as they sound and besides both were partly the fault of other people and besides he has changed the larceny he explains as a series of math errors compounded by the mistake of a bank official as for why the bank thought he was a doctor that was just a simple misunderstanding because he jokingly referred to himself as a doctor in memory he still cant quite believe he was prosecuted for the larceny charges give me a break he says  sec and various statesedit trudeau began working for nutrition for life a multilevel marketing program in the mids in  his recruitment practices were cited by the states of illinois and michigan as well as the us securities and exchange commission illinois sued trudeau and jules leib his

false or misleading claims these infomercials included hair farming mega memory system addiction breaking system action reading edens secret and mega reading the products included a hair farming system that was supposed to finally end baldness in the human race and a breakthrough that in  seconds can eliminate addictions discovered when a certain dr callahan was studying quantum physics  ftc contempt of court and injunctionedit in june  the ftc filed a complaint in the us district court for the northern district of illinois against trudeau and some of his companies shop america usa llc shop america marketing group llc and trustar global media limited alleging that diseaserelated claims for coral calcium supreme were false and unsubstantiated in july  trudeau entered into a stipulated preliminary injunction that prohibited him from continuing to make the challenged claims for coral calcium supreme and biotape in the summer of  the court found trudeau in contempt of court for violating the preliminary injunction because he had sent out a direct mail piece and produced an infomercial making prohibited claims the court ordered trudeau to cease all marketing for coral calcium products in september  trudeau agreed to pay  million  in cash plus transfer of residential property located in ojai california and a luxury vehicle to settle charges that he falsely claimed that a coral calcium product can cure cancer and other serious diseases and that a purported analgesic called biotape can permanently cure or relieve severe pain he also agreed to a lifetime ban on promoting products using infomercials but excluded restrictions to promote his books via infomercials trudeau was the only person ever banned by the ftc from selling a product via television lydia parnes speaking for the ftcs bureau of consumer protection stated this ban is meant to shut down an infomercial empire that has misled american consumers for years trudeau claimed the government was trying to discredit his book because he was exposing them  trudeau v ftcedit on february   trudeau filed a complaint against the ftc in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief trudeau also filed a motion for preliminary injunction which the court denied the complaint charged that the ftc had retaliated against him for his criticism of the agency by issuing a press release that falsely characterized and intentionally and deliberately misrepresented the  final order that conduct trudeau asserted exceeded the ftcs authority under  usc § f and violated the first amendment the ftc responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under rule b the district court granted the ftcs motion to dismiss first the court concluded that it lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction because the press release was not a final agency action under “section  of the administrative procedure act”  usc §  second the court held in the alternative that trudeau’s claims failed to state a viable cause of action as a matter of law trudeau later filed an appeal which was unsuccessful in reversing the courts ruling  trudeau v new york consumer protection boardedit trudeau filed a lawsuit on august   accusing the new york state consumer protection board of violating his first amendment rights by contacting television stations in new york state and urging them to pull trudeaus infomercials promoting his book natural cures they dont want you to know about trudeau won a temporary restraining order on september   prohibiting the board from sending letters to the television stations the temporary restraining order was replaced by a preliminary injunction however trudeau lost a motion to have the board send a corrective letter to the television stations and subsequently dropped all claims for monetary damages the case is still in litigationcitation needed  ftc contempt of court actionedit the ftc filed a contempt of court action against trudeau and the companies that market the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about alleging that trudeau was in contempt of a  court order by deceptively claiming in his infomercials that the book being advertised establishes a weightloss protocol that is easy to follow the action was filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois on september   according to an ftc press release trudeau has claimed that the weight loss plan outlined in the book is easy can be done at home and readers can eat anything they want when consumers buy the book they find it describes a complex plan that requires intense dieting daily injections of a prescribed drug that is not easily obtainable and lifelong dietary restrictions on november   trudeau was found in contempt of the  court order for patently false claims in his weight loss book us district court judge robert w gettleman ruled that trudeau clearly misrepresents in his advertisements the difficulty of the diet described in his book and by doing so he has misled thousands of consumers on august   gettleman issued an order that trudeau was not to appear in infomercials for any product in which he has any interest for three years from the date of the order and was to pay a penalty of  an estimate of the royalties received from the weight loss book on november   gettleman amended the judgment to  the amount consumers paid in response to the deceptive infomercials the court denied trudeaus request to reconsider or stay this ruling on december  of the same year trudeau appealed the ruling to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit which upheld the contempt finding but sent the case back to the lower court to explain the basis of the  damage finding and the threeyear infomercial ban after the lower court justified the basis for the damage finding and set a  million performance bond for future infomercial advertising trudeau again appealed to the seventh circuit which affirmed the damage award on november    arrest on criminal contempt of court chargeedit on february   trudeau was arrested and appeared in us district court before gettleman for criminal contempt of court after he asked his supporters to email the federal judge overseeing a pending civil case brought against him by the federal trade commission he was forced to turn over his passport pay a  bond and was warned he could face future prison time for interfering with the direct process of the court on february  gettleman sentenced trudeau to  days in jail and forfeiture of the  bond wellknown critic of trudeau stephen barrett the creator of quackwatchorg has for years labeled trudeau a fraud and was quoted he struck me as somebody who believes he is omnipotent that is no one can touch him barrett said that’s almost been the case trudeau appealed the ruling and on may  the seventh circuit court of appeals granted his motion dismissing the contempt citation  loss of appeal against m fineedit on november   the us food and drug administration and the federal trade commission issued warnings to companies selling human chorionic gonadotropin hcg as weight loss products as the claims are unsupported the hcg diet was popularized by trudeaus the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about book in  on nov   trudeau lost his  appeal in the seventh circuit court of appeals the court found that the  million fine for violating his  settlement with the federal trade commission was appropriate as trudeau had aired  infomercials and described the figure as conservative the court considered sales only from the  number used to place orders and excluded internet and store sales additionally the court found that requiring trudeau to make a  million performance bond prior to participating in an infomercial was constitutional – additional contempt citations asset concealment imprisonmentedit in september  judge robert gettleman held trudeau in civil contempt for violation of multiple court orders and failure to pay the  million fine assessed in  noting that he continued to maintain a lavish lifestyle despite insisting that he had been “completely wiped out” financially gettleman appointed a receiver to identify and catalog trudeaus assets and holdings a month later trudeau was arrested after refusing to cooperate with the receivers investigation in november a jury found him in criminal contempt for repeated violations of his  agreement as well as subsequent orders and plea deals pending sentencing he was held without bail as a flight risk and for continued failure to disclose hidden assets in february  the courtappointed receiver announced that a number of trudeaus known assets including a home in ojai california would be auctioned with proceeds to be applied toward unpaid fines and restitutions the receiver also assumed control of trudeaus global information network gin the nevisbased secret club that had promised extraordinary secrets to success court officials informed gin members that the club’s business model “likely amounted to an illegal pyramid scheme and that its relentlessly publicized group of  billionaire financial advisors known as the “gin council” did not exist gins remaining assets were later auctioned as well in march  trudeau was sentenced to  years in prison an unusually lengthy term for a contempt conviction judge ronald guzman visibly irritated by trudeaus plea for leniency described him as deceitful to the core trudeau has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions  or at most impediments to be sidestepped outmaneuvered or just ignored guzman said that type of conduct simply cannot stand trudeau filed an appeal contending that a gettleman erred in ruling that trudeaus misrepresentations of the content of free money they dont want you to know about was in contempt of the court’s  order b that the district court abused its discretion when it ordered him to pay compensatory damages of  million and c further abused its discretion when it amended its  order to prohibit him from participating in infomercials promoting his books in february  a federal appeals court found no basis to accept trudeaus claims and ruled that the year sentence was reasonable given the size of trudeaus fraud and the flagrant and repetitive nature of his contumacious conduct trudeau is currently serving his sentence at the federal prison camp montgomery in alabama he maintains an active facebook page where he solicits donations for his defense fund and compares his imprisonment to that of nelson mandela in april  guzman ordered that royalties payable to trudeau from continuing sales of his books—now owned by a california company called free is my favorite llc which purchased the rights from trudeau—be forwarded to a governmentcontrolled trust and used for fine and restitution payments infomercials for free money they dont want you to know about produced and marketed by free is my favorite llc continue to run on television stations throughout the united states in october  gettleman approved a partial refund of about  million to more than  people who bought the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about other criticismsedit medical experienceedit one common criticism by consumer groups is that trudeau has had no medical training trudeau responds that by not having such training he is not biased toward pharmaceutical companies and the fda and that medical doctors are taught only how to write out prescriptions for poisons and cut out pieces of a persons anatomy unsubstantiated claimsedit trudeau has been criticized for his inability to provide evidence to back up his claims although he recites anecdotes he has never provided evidence evaluated by licensed medical practitioners in instances where trudeau has been asked to provide proof he has misinterpreted medical studies or cited dubious or fictitious studies for example trudeau cited a nonexistent year research study involving a natural cure for diabetes at the university of calgary when abc news correspondent jake tapper confronted him on nightline trudeau insisted that he had a copy of the study and would provide it he never did he later claimed in his infomercials that the university destroyed its findings to prevent reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry in  university of calgary officials announced in a public statement that none of trudeaus claims about the universitys research were true and that its attorneys had sent trudeau a cease and desist letter demanding that he stop associating himself with the school false endorsementsedit in august  the new york consumer protection board warned consumers that trudeau has used false claims of endorsements to promote his products noting that the back cover of natural cures includes false endorsements further the nycpb states that trudeaus television ads give the false impression that tammy faye messner opposes chemotherapy in favor of the natural cures in trudeaus book a representative for messner before her death from cancer said that was not true and that she was starting chemotherapy again the back cover includes the following quote from dr herbert ley a former commissioner of the us food and drug administration who died three years before the book was written the thing that bugs me is that people think the fda is protecting them it isnt what the fda is doing and what people think its doing are as different as night and day the statement extracted from a  new york times interview was made in the context of leys resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes trudeaus lawyer david j bradford says that this quote does not constitute a false endorsement of the book by ley but rather is merely a statement that is in line with the purpose of the book referencesedit  kevin trudeau banned from infomercials for three years ordered to pay more than  million for false claims about weightloss book

america they promoted a range of products including health aids dietary supplements such as coral calcium baldness remedies addiction treatments memoryimprovement courses readingimprovement programs and real estate investment strategies the ftc took regulatory action against trudeau alleging that his broadcasts contained unsubstantiated claims and misrepresentations in  he was fined in  he settled a contemptofcourt action arising out of the same cases by agreeing to a settlement that included both payment of a  million fine and a ban on further use of infomercials to promote any product other than publications protected by the first amendment in  trudeau began writing books and promoting them with infomercials in the us the first book he published was a medical guide titled natural cures they dont want you to know about which was published in  the book was criticized for containing no natural cures trudeau claimed that he was not able to include them because of threats by the ftc the book became a bestseller selling  million copies two years later trudeau published a second medical book titled more natural cures revealed previously censored brand name products that cure disease isbn  according to trudeau the book identifies brand name products that will cure myriad illnesses trudeaus books claim that animals in the wild rarely develop degenerative conditions like cancer or alzheimers disease and that many diseases are caused not by viruses or bacteria but rather by an imbalance in vital energy science writer christopher wanjek critiqued and rejected many of these claims in his july   livesciencecom health column trudeau went on to publish the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about and debt cures they dont want you to know about his writing has been commercially successful in september  natural cures was listed in the new york times as the numberoneselling nonfiction book in the united states for  weeks it has sold more than five million

ended in annulment after four months in  he married natalya babenko another ukrainian who currently runs several of his former companies she has returned to her home in kiev according to trudeau publicationsedit natural cures “they” don’t want you to know aboutedit in  trudeau selfpublished his book natural cures they dont want you to know about in which he made a number of unsubstantiated claims—for example that sunlight does not cause cancer sunscreen is one of the major causes of skin cancer and aids was a hoax devised as an excuse to stimulate medication usage trudeau further suggested—again without documentation—that various natural cures for serious illnesses including cancer herpes arthritis aids acid reflux disease various phobias depression obesity diabetes multiple sclerosis lupus chronic fatigue syndrome attention deficit disorder and muscular dystrophy had been deliberately hidden from the public by the food and drug administration the federal trade commission and the major food and drug companies in one widely quoted example he asserted that the university of calgary had developed a natural diabetes treatment then quashed its data fearing reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry a spokesman for the school told abc news that there have been no human studies conducted at the university of calgary in the past  years on herbal remedies for diabetes the university later sent trudeau a cease and desist letter ordering him to stop using its name rose shapiro cited natural cures as a prime example in her book suckers how alternative medicine makes fools of us all natural cures sold briskly due to an aggressive infomercial promotion quackwatch and other internet watchdog sites cautioned that the infomercial itself was misleading in a  public warning from the new york state consumer protection board cpb chairman teresa a santiago cautioned that natural cures contained no actual cures only “speculation” cures were promised but only by subscribing to trudeaus newsletter or website at  per year or  for a lifetime membership the paid sites contained only additional similarly unsubstantiated speculation according to the cpb the chicago tribune also noted that a purported backcover endorsement by former fda commissioner herbert ley—who died three years before the book was written—was actually an excerpt from a yearold new york times interview more natural cures revealededit following natural cures they don’t want you to know about trudeau released a second medical guide two years later his second book was selfpublished as well and titled more natural cures revealed previously censored brand name products that cure disease the book is a similar publication to his first where he purports to explain why drug and food companies hide the truth about how their products can cause disease in more natural cures revealed trudeau writes that workers at the fda and ftc want to censor him and figuratively burn his books though the book received negative comments from some reviewers it received average ratings on both amazon and goodreadscom the weight loss cure “they” dont want you to know aboutedit main article the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about in april  trudeau released the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about the book describes a weight loss plan originally proposed by british endocrinologist atw simeons in the s involving injections of human chorionic gonadotropin the diet was criticized in  by the journal of the american medical association as hazardous to human health and a waste of money in  the ftc ordered clinics and promoters of the simeons diet and hcg to inform prospective patients that there had not been substantial evidence to conclude hcg offered any benefit above that achieved on a restricted calorie diet clinical research trials published by the journal of the american medical association and the american journal of clinical nutrition have shown that hcg is ineffective as a weightloss aid citing no statistically significant difference in the means of the two groups and that hcg does not appear to enhance the effectiveness of a rigidly imposed regimen for weight reduction the ftc has filed a contemptofcourt action against trudeau alleging that the alleged misrepresentations in the book violate a  consent order debt cures “they” dont want you to know aboutedit debt cures was published in  and has been marketed on television chuck jaffee a columnist at cbs marketwatch stated truth be told most of the information in the book is readily available in personal finance columns you can find online or in books that are readily available in your local library trudeau says that if readers disagree with items on their credit reports they can dispute them as identity theft this was the magic cure of the books title trudeau sometimes mentions esteemed names throughout his books to extend himself credibility such as hazel valera executive director of the californiabased nonprofit organization clear credit exchange harvard law professor elizabeth warren and robert hinsley of consumers defense yet none of the mentioned were ever interviewed by trudeau your wish is your commandedit published in  the product says it gives tools on how to use the law of attraction to manifest readers desires the packaging also says it contains key links to using the law of attraction that are missing in other publications among the claims made in the related infomercial is trudeaus assertion to have virtually flunked out of high school he also says he was taken in by a mysterious group called the brotherhood that taught him the secrets that he is now widely announcing in his book there is also an invitation to join the now defunct global information network an exclusive group of highly influential affluent and freedomorientated sic people see below the network operated out of the caribbean island nevis and employed the law of attraction as its principal wealth generator a concept regarded by most in the scientific community as at best pseudoscience media interviewsedit trudeau has been interviewed by cnns paula zahn matt lauer of nbcs today show and harry smith of cbss the early show trudeau was also the subject of investigative reports done by inside edition abcs  and dateline nbc the  segment highlighted a nightline interview with jake tapper in which trudeau misrepresented the money he was forced to pay to the government the charges filed against him and the reason the government did not follow through with charges and claiming ignorance when the claims made in his book were called false by tapper trudeau was interviewed by jacques peretti for the fourth episode of the series the men who made us thin on bbc infomercialsedit at one time trudeau was a prolific producer of infomercials he consented to an ftc ban applying to everything except publications that the ftc concluded would infringe upon his first amendment rights all of his subsequent infomercials advertised his books natural cures they dont want you to know about and the weight loss cure notable cohosts included leigh valentine former wife of televangelist robert tilton and the late tammy faye messner the former tammy faye bakker pharmaceutical companiesedit this section of a biography of a living person needs additional citations

harmful november  learn how and when to remove this template message trudeau says that pharmaceutical companies dont want us to get well because curing disease is not nearly as profitable as treating it in perpetuity according to trudeau the corporate profit motive overrides the human desire to truly help people trudeau says that natural treatments cannot be patented and are not profitable enough to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars in testing so they will always lack fda approval trudeau uses herpes as an example saying that people with herpes must buy an expensive drug for the rest of their lives he says that if there were a cheap easy cure for herpes the fda and pharmaceutical companies would not want the population to know about it because corporate profits would suffer he cites the number of advertisements on television for prescription drugs and points out that prescription drugs should be advertised to doctors not to the general public he states in one infomercial that there are twelve known cures for cancer but that they are being kept from the general public by the fda the ftc and the pharmaceutical companies he also says that the fda and the ftc are two of the most corrupt organizations in america and that there is a long list of chemical ingredients that are secretly not required to be on the fda ingredients label that are damaging to human health trudeau offers a conspiracy theory saying that the drug industry and the fda work with each other to effectively deceive the public by banning allnatural cures in order to protect the profits of the drug industry trudeau says that fda commissioners who leave the fda to work for large drug companies are paid millions of dollars in any other industry according to trudeau this would be called bribery a conflict of interest or payoffs trudeau also says in his infomercials that the food industry includes chemicals such as msg and aspartame to get people addicted to food and to make people obese trudeau has also declared that he will lead a crusade against the fda and the ftc and will make an effort to sue companies who promote false claims in advertising such as leading pharmaceutical companies references to scientific studiesedit one of the major complaints about trudeaus infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies making them impossible to crosscheck for accuracy the same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence he presents in the infomercials he does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods for example he tells a story in an infomercial about a friend from england who came to his house and complained of heartburn he also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of st johns wort compared to two prescription medications these studies the informercials suggest are identified in the book being advertised for sale but none of his books provide any such substantiation in an interview he explained that he cannot reveal his source material because of ftc suppression but readers can join his web site where for  a month or  for a lifetime they can gain access to the special membersonly section from which they can email him for the information newspaper articlesedit a pair of  associated press articles by candice choi on the infomercials elaborated on the success and problems of the programs choi says that by repeatedly mentioning government sanctions against him trudeau anticipated any backlash with his cuckoo conspiracy theory and can partially deflect any criticism of him or his infomercials trudeaus use of the word cure is an issue for regulators also bookstores are polled on their decisions to sell or not sell a successful and controversial selfpublished book additional marketing venturesedit audio tapes “mega memory”edit trudeau says he adapted techniques used to improve the memory of the blind and the mentally challenged to create mega memory and advanced mega memory audio tapes his promotion of memoryenhancing products was ended by the intervention of the federal trade commission which alleged that the claims made by trudeau were false and programs involved would not enable users to achieve a photographic memory as the advertising claimed trudeau used research that dr michael van masters conducted with the state school for the blind in muskogee oklahoma in  as the basis of the mega memory products trudeau was selling automobiles at neponset lincoln mercury in the dorchester neighborhood of boston in  when he first met van masters shortly after meeting van masters trudeau joined van masters in the memory business in chicagocitation needed nonsurgical faceliftedit in addition to natural cures trudeau also hosted an infomercial that

that they had partnered with trudeau to market both of his natural cures books trudeau also worked with itv to create itv ventures a new mlm group based out of itvs home office as of december  itv direct has pulled all information concerning both this partnership and trudeaus books from its corporate website however the infomercials continued to run as of april   international pool touredit ipt starship stage for tv rounds and finals at north american championship held in las vegas nevada july  main article international pool tour in  trudeau founded the international pool tour ipt his goal was to transform billiards into a major league sport with aggressive promotion and the largest purses ever offered the initial three events in  and early  were successful but at the fourth the ipt world open tournament in reno nevada promoters announced that they did not have sufficient funds on hand to cover the purse winners were assured that they would receive their prizes in small installments but most were never paid the reno fiasco marked the demise not only of ipt but of professional pool competitions as a whole as one commentator put it the pool hustler wasn’t murdered by any single suspect but the last man holding the knife was kevin trudeau legal proceedingsedit in connection with his promotional activities he has had a felony conviction and has been an unsuccessful defendant in several federal trade commission ftc lawsuits trudeau has been charged several times by agencies of the united states government for making claims without evidence in these cases trudeau signed a consent decree in which he did not plead guilty but did agree to stop making the claims and to pay a fine trudeau subsequently began to sell books which are protected by the first amendment trudeau was convicted of fraud and larceny in the early s the ftc has sued him repeatedly and keeps an extensive record of its conflicts with him a court order currently restricts his ability to promote and sell any product or service however he is permitted to promote books and other publications due to freespeech protection under the first amendment as long as they are not used to promote or sell products or services and do not contain misrepresentations on november   a court found trudeau in contempt of that court order for making deceptive claims about his book the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about in august  he was fined more than  million and banned from infomercials for three years for continuing to make fraudulent claims pertaining to the book the amount of the monetary damages was later increased to  million – larceny and credit card fraudedit in  trudeau posed as a doctor in order to deposit  in false checks and in  he pleaded guilty to larceny that same year trudeau faced federal charges of credit card fraud after he stole the names and social security numbers of eleven customers of a mega memory product and charged  on their credit cards he spent two years in federal prison because of this conviction later in an interview he explained his crimes as  youthful indiscretions and not as bad as they sound and besides both were partly the fault of other people and besides he has changed the larceny he explains as a series of math errors compounded by the mistake of a bank official as for why the bank thought he was a doctor that was just a simple misunderstanding because he jokingly referred to himself as a doctor in memory he still cant quite believe he was prosecuted for the larceny charges give me a break he says  sec and various statesedit trudeau began working for nutrition for life a multilevel marketing program in the mids in  his recruitment practices were cited by the states of illinois and michigan as well as the us securities and exchange commission illinois sued trudeau and jules leib his partner accusing them of operating an illegal pyramid scheme they settled with illinois and seven other states for

misrepresenting andor omitting material information about nutrition for life international incs business in august  the company paid  million in cash to common stockholders and holders of warrants during the class period to settle the case the company also paid the plaintiffs attorney fees of   ftc fineedit in  trudeau was fined  the funds to be used for consumer redress by the ftc relating to six infomercials he had produced and in which the ftc determined he had made false or misleading claims these infomercials included hair farming mega memory system addiction breaking system action reading edens secret and mega reading the products included a hair farming system that was supposed to finally end baldness in the human race and a breakthrough that in  seconds can eliminate addictions discovered when a certain dr callahan was studying quantum physics  ftc contempt of court and injunctionedit in june  the ftc filed a complaint in the us district court for the northern district of illinois against trudeau and some of his companies shop america usa llc shop america marketing group llc and trustar global media limited alleging that diseaserelated claims for coral calcium supreme were false and unsubstantiated in july  trudeau entered into a stipulated preliminary injunction that prohibited him from continuing to make the challenged claims for coral calcium supreme and biotape in the summer of  the court found trudeau in contempt of court for violating the preliminary injunction because he had sent out a direct mail piece and produced an infomercial making prohibited claims the court ordered trudeau to cease all marketing for coral calcium products in september  trudeau agreed to pay  million  in cash plus transfer of residential property located in ojai california and a luxury vehicle to settle charges that he falsely claimed that a coral calcium product can cure cancer and other serious diseases and that a purported analgesic called biotape can permanently cure or relieve severe pain he also agreed to a lifetime ban on promoting products using infomercials but excluded restrictions to promote his books via infomercials trudeau was the only person ever banned by the ftc from selling a product via television lydia parnes speaking for the ftcs bureau of consumer protection stated this ban is meant to shut down an infomercial empire that has misled american consumers for years trudeau claimed the government was trying to discredit his book because he was exposing them  trudeau v ftcedit on february   trudeau filed a complaint against the ftc in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief trudeau also filed a motion for preliminary injunction which the court denied the complaint charged that the ftc had retaliated against him for his criticism of the agency by issuing a press release that falsely characterized and intentionally and deliberately misrepresented the  final order that conduct trudeau asserted exceeded the ftcs authority under  usc § f and violated the first amendment the ftc responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under rule b the district court granted the ftcs motion to dismiss first the court concluded that it lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction because the press release was not a final agency action under “section  of the administrative procedure act”  usc §  second the court held in the alternative that trudeau’s claims failed to state a viable cause of action as a matter of law trudeau later filed an appeal which was unsuccessful in reversing the courts ruling  trudeau v new york consumer protection boardedit trudeau filed a lawsuit on august   accusing the new york state consumer protection board of violating his first amendment rights by contacting television stations in new york state and urging them to pull trudeaus infomercials promoting his book natural cures they dont want you to know about trudeau won a temporary restraining order on september   prohibiting the board from sending letters to the television stations the temporary restraining order was replaced by a preliminary injunction however trudeau lost a motion to have the board send a corrective letter to the television stations and subsequently dropped all claims for monetary damages the case is still in litigationcitation needed  ftc contempt of court actionedit the ftc filed a contempt of court action against trudeau and the companies that market the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about alleging that trudeau was in contempt of a  court order by deceptively claiming in his infomercials that the book being advertised establishes a weightloss protocol that is easy to follow the action was filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois on september   according to an ftc press release trudeau has claimed that the weight loss plan outlined in the book is easy can be done at home and readers can eat anything they want when consumers buy the book they find it describes a complex plan that requires intense dieting daily injections of a prescribed drug that is not easily obtainable and lifelong dietary restrictions on november   trudeau was found in contempt of the  court order for patently false claims in his weight loss book us district court judge robert w gettleman ruled that trudeau clearly misrepresents in his advertisements the difficulty of the diet described in his book and by doing so he has misled thousands of consumers on august   gettleman issued an order that trudeau was not to appear in infomercials for any product in which he has any interest for three years from the date of the order and was to pay a penalty of  an estimate of the royalties received from the weight loss book on november   gettleman amended the judgment to  the amount consumers paid in response to the deceptive infomercials the court denied trudeaus request to reconsider or stay this ruling on december  of the same year trudeau appealed the ruling to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit which upheld the contempt finding but sent the case back to the lower court to explain the basis of the  damage finding and the threeyear infomercial ban after the lower court justified the basis for the damage finding and set a  million performance bond for future infomercial advertising trudeau again appealed to the seventh circuit which affirmed the damage award on november    arrest on criminal contempt of court chargeedit on february   trudeau was arrested and appeared in us district court before gettleman for criminal contempt of court after he asked his supporters to email the federal judge overseeing a pending civil case brought against him by the federal trade commission he was forced to turn over his passport pay a  bond and was warned he could face future prison time for interfering with the direct process of the court on february  gettleman sentenced trudeau to  days in jail and forfeiture of the  bond wellknown critic of trudeau stephen barrett the creator of quackwatchorg has for years labeled trudeau a fraud and was quoted he struck me as somebody who believes he is omnipotent that is no one can touch him barrett said that’s almost been the case trudeau appealed the ruling and on may  the seventh circuit court of appeals granted his motion dismissing the contempt citation  loss of appeal against m fineedit on november   the us food and drug administration and the federal trade commission issued warnings to companies selling human chorionic gonadotropin hcg as weight loss products as the claims are unsupported the hcg diet was popularized by trudeaus the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about book in  on nov   trudeau lost his  appeal in the seventh circuit court of appeals the court found that the  million fine for violating his  settlement with the federal trade commission was appropriate as trudeau had aired  infomercials and described the figure as conservative the court considered sales only from the  number used to place orders and excluded internet and store sales additionally the court found that requiring trudeau to make a  million performance bond prior to participating in an infomercial was constitutional – additional contempt citations asset concealment imprisonmentedit in september  judge robert gettleman held trudeau in civil contempt for violation of multiple court orders and failure to pay the  million fine assessed in  noting that he continued to maintain a lavish lifestyle despite insisting that he had been “completely wiped out” financially gettleman appointed a receiver to identify and catalog trudeaus assets and holdings a month later trudeau was arrested after refusing to cooperate with the receivers investigation in november a jury found him in criminal contempt for repeated violations of his  agreement as well as subsequent orders and plea deals pending sentencing he was held without bail as a flight risk and for continued failure to disclose hidden assets in february  the courtappointed receiver announced that a number of trudeaus known assets including a home in ojai california would be auctioned with proceeds to be applied toward unpaid fines and restitutions the receiver also assumed control of trudeaus global information network gin the nevisbased secret club that had promised extraordinary secrets to success court officials informed gin members that the club’s business model “likely amounted to an illegal pyramid scheme and that its relentlessly publicized group of  billionaire financial advisors known as the “gin council” did not exist gins remaining assets were later auctioned as well in march  trudeau was sentenced to  years in prison an unusually lengthy term for a contempt conviction judge ronald guzman visibly irritated by trudeaus plea for leniency described him as deceitful to the core trudeau has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions  or at most impediments to be sidestepped outmaneuvered or just ignored guzman said that type of conduct simply cannot stand trudeau filed an appeal contending that a gettleman erred in ruling that trudeaus misrepresentations of the content of free money they dont want you to know about was in contempt of the court’s  order b that the district court abused its discretion when it ordered him to pay compensatory damages of  million and c further abused its discretion when it amended its  order to prohibit him from participating in infomercials promoting his books in february  a federal appeals court found no basis to accept trudeaus claims and ruled that the year sentence was reasonable given the size of trudeaus fraud and the flagrant and repetitive nature of his contumacious conduct trudeau is currently serving his sentence at the federal prison camp montgomery in alabama he maintains an active facebook page where he solicits donations for his defense fund and compares his imprisonment to that of nelson mandela in april  guzman ordered that royalties payable to trudeau from continuing sales of his books—now owned by a california company called free is my favorite llc which purchased the rights from trudeau—be forwarded to a governmentcontrolled trust and used for fine and restitution payments infomercials for free money they dont want you to know about produced and marketed by free is my favorite llc continue to run on television stations throughout the united states in october  gettleman approved a partial refund of about  million to more than  people who bought the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about other criticismsedit medical experienceedit one common criticism by consumer groups is that trudeau has had no medical training trudeau responds that by not having such training he is not biased toward pharmaceutical companies and the fda and that medical doctors are taught only how to write out prescriptions for poisons and cut out pieces of a persons anatomy unsubstantiated claimsedit trudeau has been criticized for his inability to provide evidence to back up his claims although he recites anecdotes he has never provided evidence evaluated by licensed medical practitioners in instances where trudeau has been asked to provide proof he has misinterpreted medical studies or cited dubious or fictitious studies for example trudeau cited a nonexistent year research study involving a natural cure for diabetes at the university of calgary when abc news correspondent jake tapper confronted him on nightline trudeau insisted that he had a copy of the study and would provide it he never did he later claimed in his infomercials that the university destroyed its findings to prevent reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry in  university of calgary officials announced in a public statement that none of trudeaus claims about the universitys research were true and that its attorneys had sent trudeau a cease and desist letter demanding that he stop associating himself with the school false endorsementsedit in august  the new york consumer protection board warned consumers that trudeau has used false claims of endorsements to promote his products noting that the back cover of natural cures includes false endorsements further the nycpb states that trudeaus television ads give the false impression that tammy faye messner opposes chemotherapy in favor of the natural cures in trudeaus book a representative for messner before her death from cancer said that was not true and that she was starting chemotherapy again the back cover includes the following quote from dr herbert ley a former commissioner of the us food and drug administration who died three years before the book was written the thing that bugs me is that people think the fda is protecting them it isnt what the fda is doing and what people think its doing are as different as night and day the statement extracted from a  new york times interview was made in the context of leys resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes trudeaus lawyer david j bradford says that this quote does not constitute a false endorsement of the book by ley but rather is merely a statement that is in line with the purpose of the book referencesedit  kevin trudeau banned from infomercials for three years

series of latenight television infomercial broadcasts throughout north america they promoted a range of products including health aids dietary supplements such as coral calcium baldness remedies

unsubstantiated claims and misrepresentations in  he was fined in  he settled a contemptofcourt action arising out of the same cases by agreeing to a settlement that included both payment of a  million fine and a ban on further use of infomercials to promote any product other than publications protected by the first amendment in  trudeau began writing books and promoting them with infomercials in the us the first book he published was a medical guide titled natural cures they dont want you to know about which was published in  the book was criticized for containing no natural cures trudeau claimed that he was not able to include them because of threats by the ftc the book became a bestseller selling  million copies two years later trudeau published a second medical book titled more natural cures revealed previously censored brand name products that cure disease isbn  according to trudeau the book identifies brand name products that will cure myriad illnesses trudeaus books claim that animals in the wild rarely develop degenerative conditions like cancer or alzheimers disease and that many diseases are caused not by viruses or bacteria but rather by an imbalance in vital energy science writer christopher wanjek critiqued and rejected many of these claims in his july   livesciencecom health column trudeau went on to publish the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about and debt cures they dont want you to know about his writing has been commercially successful in september  natural cures was listed in the new york times as the numberoneselling

stations consisting of mostly brokered programming personal lifeedit trudeau has been married at least three times little is known about his first marriage to oleksandra polozhentseva a ukrainian immigrant his second union in  to kristine dorow a norwegian student whom he met in london ended in annulment after four months in  he married natalya babenko another ukrainian who currently runs several of his former companies she has returned to her home in kiev according to trudeau publicationsedit natural cures “they” don’t want you to know aboutedit in  trudeau selfpublished his book natural cures they dont want you to know about in which he made a number of unsubstantiated claims—for example that sunlight does not cause cancer sunscreen is one of the major causes of skin cancer and aids was a hoax devised as an excuse to stimulate medication usage trudeau further suggested—again without documentation—that various natural cures for serious illnesses including cancer herpes arthritis aids acid reflux disease various phobias depression obesity diabetes multiple sclerosis lupus chronic fatigue syndrome attention deficit disorder and muscular dystrophy had been deliberately hidden from the public by the food and drug administration the federal trade commission and the major food and drug companies in one widely quoted example he asserted that the university of calgary had developed a natural diabetes treatment then quashed its data fearing reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry a spokesman for the school told abc news that there have been no human studies conducted at the university of calgary in the past  years on herbal remedies for diabetes the university later sent trudeau a cease and desist letter ordering him to stop using its name rose shapiro cited natural cures as a prime example in her book suckers how alternative medicine makes fools of us all natural cures sold briskly due to an aggressive infomercial promotion quackwatch and other internet watchdog sites cautioned that the infomercial itself was misleading in a  public warning from the new york state consumer protection board cpb chairman teresa a santiago cautioned that natural cures contained no actual cures only “speculation” cures were promised but only by subscribing to trudeaus newsletter or website at  per year or  for a lifetime membership the paid sites contained only additional similarly unsubstantiated speculation according to the cpb the chicago tribune also noted that a purported backcover endorsement by former fda commissioner herbert ley—who died three years before the book was written—was actually an excerpt from a yearold new york times interview more natural cures revealededit following natural cures they don’t want you to know about trudeau released a second medical guide two years later his second book was selfpublished as well and titled more natural cures revealed previously censored brand name products that cure disease the book is a similar publication to his first where he purports to explain why drug and food companies hide the truth about how their products can cause disease in more natural cures revealed trudeau writes that workers at the fda and ftc want to censor him and figuratively burn his books though the book received negative comments from some reviewers it received average ratings on both amazon and goodreadscom the weight loss cure “they” dont want you to know aboutedit main article the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about in april  trudeau released the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about the book describes a weight loss plan originally proposed by british endocrinologist atw simeons in the s involving injections of human chorionic gonadotropin the diet was criticized in  by the journal of the american medical association as hazardous to human health and a waste of money in  the ftc ordered clinics and promoters of the simeons diet and hcg to inform prospective patients that there had not been substantial evidence to conclude hcg offered any benefit above that achieved on a restricted calorie diet clinical research trials published by the journal of the american medical association and the american journal of clinical nutrition have shown that hcg is ineffective as a weightloss aid citing no statistically significant difference in the means of the two groups and that hcg does not appear to enhance the effectiveness of a rigidly imposed regimen for weight reduction the ftc has filed a contemptofcourt action against trudeau alleging that the alleged misrepresentations in the book violate a  consent order debt cures “they” dont want you to know aboutedit debt cures was published in  and has been marketed on television chuck jaffee a columnist at cbs marketwatch stated truth be told most of the information in the book is readily available in personal finance columns you can find online or in books that are readily available in your local library trudeau says that if readers disagree with items on their credit reports they can dispute them as identity theft this was the magic cure of the books title trudeau sometimes mentions esteemed names throughout his books to extend himself credibility such as hazel valera executive director of the californiabased nonprofit organization clear credit exchange harvard law professor elizabeth warren and robert hinsley of consumers defense yet none of the mentioned were ever interviewed by trudeau your wish is your commandedit published in  the product says it gives tools on how to use the law of attraction to manifest readers desires the packaging also says it contains key links to using the law of attraction that are missing in other publications among the claims made in the related infomercial is trudeaus assertion to have virtually flunked out of high school he also says he was taken in by a mysterious group called the brotherhood that taught him the secrets that he is now widely announcing in his book there is also an invitation to join the now defunct global information network an exclusive group of highly influential affluent and freedomorientated sic people see below the network operated out of the caribbean island nevis and employed the law of attraction as its principal wealth generator a concept regarded by most in the scientific community as at best pseudoscience media interviewsedit trudeau has been interviewed by cnns paula zahn matt lauer of nbcs today show and harry smith of cbss the early show trudeau was also the subject of investigative reports done by inside edition abcs  and dateline nbc the  segment highlighted a nightline interview with jake tapper in which trudeau misrepresented the money he was forced to pay to the government the charges filed against him and the reason the government did not follow through with charges and claiming ignorance when the claims made in his book were called false by tapper trudeau was interviewed by jacques peretti for the fourth episode of the series the men who made us thin on bbc infomercialsedit at one time trudeau was a prolific producer of infomercials he consented to an ftc ban applying to everything except publications that the ftc concluded would infringe upon his first amendment rights all of his subsequent infomercials advertised his books natural cures they dont want you to know about and the weight loss cure notable cohosts included leigh valentine former wife of televangelist robert tilton and the late tammy faye messner

material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately especially if potentially libelous or harmful november  learn how and when to remove this template message trudeau says that pharmaceutical companies dont want us to get well because curing disease is not nearly as profitable as treating it in perpetuity according to trudeau the corporate profit motive overrides the human desire to truly help people trudeau says that natural treatments cannot be patented and are not profitable enough to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars in testing so they will always lack fda approval trudeau uses herpes as an example saying that people with herpes must buy an expensive drug for the rest of their lives he says that if there were a cheap easy cure for herpes the fda and pharmaceutical companies would not want the population to know about it because corporate profits would suffer he cites the number of advertisements on television for prescription drugs and points out that prescription drugs should be advertised to doctors not to the general public he states in one infomercial that there are twelve known cures for cancer but that they are being kept from the general public by the fda the ftc and the pharmaceutical companies he also says that the fda and the ftc are two of the most corrupt organizations in america and that there is a long list of chemical ingredients that are secretly not required to be on the fda ingredients label that are damaging to human health trudeau offers a conspiracy theory saying that the drug industry and the fda work with each other to effectively deceive the public by banning allnatural cures in order to protect the profits of the drug industry trudeau says that fda commissioners who leave the fda to work for large drug companies are paid millions of dollars in any other industry according to trudeau this would be called bribery a conflict of interest or payoffs trudeau also says in his infomercials that the food industry includes chemicals such as msg and aspartame to get people addicted to food and to make people obese trudeau has also declared that he will lead a crusade against the fda and the ftc and will make an effort to sue companies who promote false claims in advertising such as leading pharmaceutical companies references to scientific studiesedit one of the major complaints about trudeaus infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies making them impossible to crosscheck for accuracy the same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence he presents in the infomercials he does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods for example he tells a story in an infomercial about a friend from england who came to his house and complained of heartburn he also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of st johns wort compared to two prescription medications these studies the informercials suggest

suppression but readers can join his web site where for  a month or  for a lifetime they can gain access to the special membersonly section from which they can email him for the information newspaper articlesedit a pair of  associated press articles by candice choi on the infomercials elaborated on the success and problems of the programs choi says that by repeatedly mentioning government sanctions against him trudeau anticipated any backlash with his cuckoo conspiracy theory and can partially deflect any criticism of him or his infomercials trudeaus use of the word cure is an issue for regulators also bookstores are polled on their decisions to sell or not sell a successful and controversial selfpublished book additional marketing venturesedit audio tapes “mega memory”edit trudeau says he adapted techniques used to improve the memory of the blind and the mentally challenged to create mega memory and advanced mega memory audio tapes his promotion of memoryenhancing products was ended by the intervention of the federal trade commission which alleged that the claims made by trudeau were false and programs involved would not enable users to achieve a photographic memory as the advertising claimed trudeau used research that dr michael van masters conducted with the state school for the blind in muskogee oklahoma in  as the basis of the mega memory products trudeau was selling automobiles at neponset lincoln mercury in the dorchester neighborhood of boston in  when he first met van masters shortly after meeting van masters trudeau joined van masters in the memory business in chicagocitation needed nonsurgical faceliftedit in addition to natural cures trudeau also hosted an infomercial that features the perfect lift nonsurgical facelift in the united

barrett and itv directedit on september   donald barrett and itv direct a direct marketing company based in beverly massachusetts announced that they had partnered with trudeau to market both of his natural cures books trudeau also worked with itv to create itv ventures a new mlm group based out of itvs home office as of december  itv direct has pulled all information concerning both this partnership and trudeaus books from its corporate website however the infomercials continued to run as of april   international pool touredit ipt starship stage for tv rounds and finals at north american championship held in las vegas nevada july  main article international pool tour in  trudeau founded the international pool tour ipt his goal was to transform billiards into a major league sport with aggressive promotion and the largest purses ever offered the initial three events in  and early  were successful but at the fourth the ipt world open tournament in reno nevada promoters announced that they did not have sufficient funds on hand to cover the purse winners were assured that they would receive their prizes in small installments but most were never paid the reno fiasco marked the demise not only of ipt but of professional pool competitions as a whole as one commentator put it the pool hustler wasn’t murdered by any single suspect but the last man holding the knife was kevin trudeau legal proceedingsedit in connection with his promotional activities he has had a felony conviction and has been an unsuccessful defendant in several federal trade commission ftc lawsuits trudeau has been charged several times by agencies of the united states government for making claims without evidence in these cases trudeau signed a consent decree in which he did not plead guilty but did agree to stop making the claims and to pay a fine trudeau subsequently began to sell books which are protected by the first amendment trudeau was convicted of fraud and larceny in the early s the ftc has sued him repeatedly and keeps an extensive record of its conflicts with him a court order currently restricts his ability to promote and sell any product or service however he is permitted to promote books and other publications due to freespeech protection under the first amendment as long as they are not used to promote or sell products or services and do not contain misrepresentations on november   a court found trudeau in contempt of that court order for making deceptive claims about his book the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about in august  he was fined more than  million and banned from infomercials for three years for continuing to make fraudulent claims pertaining to the book the amount of the monetary damages was later increased to  million – larceny and credit card fraudedit in  trudeau posed as a doctor in order to deposit  in false checks and in  he pleaded guilty to larceny that same year trudeau faced federal charges of credit card fraud after he stole the names and social security numbers of eleven customers of a mega memory product and charged  on their credit cards he spent two years in federal prison because of this conviction later in an interview he explained his crimes as  youthful indiscretions and not as bad as they sound and besides both were partly the fault of other people and besides he has changed the larceny he explains as a series of math errors compounded by the mistake of a bank official as for why the bank thought he was a doctor that was just a simple misunderstanding because he jokingly referred to himself as a doctor in memory he still cant quite believe he was prosecuted for the larceny charges give me a break he says  sec and various statesedit trudeau began working for nutrition for life a multilevel marketing program in the mids in  his recruitment practices were cited by the states of illinois and michigan as well as the us securities and exchange commission illinois sued trudeau and jules leib his partner accusing them of operating an illegal pyramid scheme they settled with illinois and seven other states for  after agreeing to change their tactics michigan forbade him from operating in the state a class action lawsuit was filed by stockholders of nutrition for life for violations of texas law including misrepresenting andor omitting material information about nutrition for life international incs business in august  the company paid  million in cash to common stockholders and holders of warrants during the class period to settle the case the company also paid the plaintiffs attorney fees of   ftc fineedit in  trudeau was fined  the funds to be used for consumer redress by the ftc relating to six infomercials he had produced and in which the ftc determined he had made false or misleading claims these infomercials included hair farming mega memory system addiction breaking system action reading edens secret and mega reading the products included a hair farming system that was supposed to finally end baldness in the human race and a breakthrough that in  seconds can eliminate addictions discovered when a certain dr callahan was studying quantum physics  ftc contempt of court and injunctionedit in june  the ftc filed a complaint in the us district court for the northern district of illinois against trudeau and some of his companies shop america usa llc shop america marketing group llc and trustar global media limited alleging that diseaserelated claims for coral calcium supreme were false and unsubstantiated in july  trudeau entered into a stipulated preliminary injunction that prohibited him from continuing to make the challenged claims for coral calcium supreme and biotape in the summer of  the court found trudeau in contempt of court for violating the preliminary injunction because he had sent out a direct mail piece and produced an infomercial making prohibited claims the court ordered trudeau to cease all marketing for coral calcium products in september  trudeau agreed to pay  million  in cash plus transfer of residential property located in ojai california and a luxury vehicle to settle charges that he falsely claimed that a coral calcium product can cure cancer and other serious diseases and that a purported analgesic called biotape can permanently cure or relieve severe pain he also agreed to a lifetime ban on promoting products using infomercials but excluded restrictions to promote his books via infomercials trudeau was the only person ever banned by the ftc from selling a product via television lydia parnes speaking for the ftcs bureau of consumer protection stated this ban is meant to shut down an infomercial empire that has misled american consumers for years trudeau claimed the government was trying to discredit his book because he was exposing them  trudeau v ftcedit on february   trudeau filed a complaint against the ftc in the us district court for the district of columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief trudeau also filed a motion for preliminary injunction which the court denied the complaint charged that the ftc had retaliated against him for his criticism of the agency by issuing a press release that falsely characterized and intentionally and deliberately misrepresented the  final order that conduct trudeau asserted exceeded the ftcs authority under  usc § f and violated the first amendment the ftc responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under rule b the district court granted the ftcs motion to dismiss first the court concluded that it lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction because the press release was not a final agency action under “section  of the administrative procedure act”  usc §  second the court held in the alternative that trudeau’s claims failed to state a viable cause of action as a matter of law trudeau later filed an appeal which was unsuccessful in reversing the courts ruling  trudeau v new york consumer protection boardedit trudeau filed a lawsuit on august   accusing the new york state consumer protection board of violating his first amendment rights by contacting television stations in new york state and urging them to pull trudeaus infomercials promoting his book natural cures they dont want you to know about trudeau won a temporary restraining order on september   prohibiting the board from sending letters to the television stations the temporary restraining order was replaced by a preliminary injunction however trudeau lost a motion to have the board send a corrective letter to the television stations and subsequently dropped all claims for monetary damages the case is still in litigationcitation needed  ftc contempt of court actionedit the ftc filed a contempt of court action against trudeau and the companies that market the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about alleging that trudeau was in contempt of a  court order by deceptively claiming in his infomercials that the book being advertised establishes a weightloss protocol that is easy to follow the action was filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois on september   according to an ftc press release trudeau has claimed that the weight loss plan outlined in the book is easy can be done at home and readers can eat anything they want when consumers buy the book they find it describes a complex plan that requires intense dieting daily injections of a prescribed drug that is not easily obtainable and lifelong dietary restrictions on november   trudeau was found in contempt of the  court order for patently false claims in his weight loss book us district court judge robert w gettleman ruled that trudeau clearly misrepresents in his advertisements the difficulty of the diet described in his book and by doing so he has misled thousands of consumers on august   gettleman issued an order that trudeau was not to appear in infomercials for any product in which he has any interest for three years from the date of the order and was to pay a penalty of  an estimate of the royalties received from the weight loss book on november   gettleman amended the judgment to  the amount consumers paid in response to the deceptive infomercials the court denied trudeaus request to reconsider or stay this ruling on december  of the same year trudeau appealed the ruling to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit which upheld the contempt finding but sent the case back to the lower court to explain the basis of the  damage finding and the threeyear infomercial ban after the lower court justified the basis for the damage finding and set a  million performance bond for future infomercial advertising trudeau again appealed to the seventh circuit which affirmed the damage award on november    arrest on criminal contempt of court chargeedit on february   trudeau was arrested and appeared in us district court before gettleman for criminal contempt of court after he asked his supporters to email the federal judge overseeing a pending civil case brought against him by the federal trade commission he was forced to turn over his passport pay a  bond and was warned he could face future prison time for interfering with the direct process of the court on february  gettleman sentenced trudeau to  days in jail and forfeiture of the  bond wellknown critic of trudeau stephen barrett the creator of quackwatchorg has for years labeled trudeau a fraud and was quoted he struck me as somebody who believes he is omnipotent that is no one can touch him barrett said that’s almost been the case trudeau appealed the ruling and on may  the seventh circuit court of appeals granted his motion dismissing the contempt citation  loss of appeal against m fineedit on november   the us food and drug administration and the federal trade commission issued warnings to companies selling human chorionic gonadotropin hcg as weight loss products as the claims are unsupported the hcg diet was popularized by trudeaus the weightloss cure they dont want you to know about book in  on nov   trudeau lost his  appeal in the seventh circuit court of appeals the court found that the  million fine for violating his  settlement with the federal trade commission was appropriate as trudeau had aired  infomercials and described the figure as conservative the court considered sales only from the  number used to place orders and excluded internet and store sales additionally the court found that requiring trudeau to make a  million performance bond prior to participating in an infomercial was constitutional – additional contempt citations asset concealment imprisonmentedit in september  judge robert gettleman held trudeau in civil contempt for violation of multiple court orders and failure to pay the  million fine assessed in  noting that he continued to maintain a lavish lifestyle despite insisting that he had been “completely wiped out” financially gettleman appointed a receiver to identify and catalog trudeaus assets and holdings a month later trudeau was arrested after refusing to cooperate with the receivers investigation in november a jury found him in criminal contempt for repeated violations of his  agreement as well as subsequent orders and plea deals pending sentencing he was held without bail as a flight risk and for continued failure to disclose hidden assets in february  the courtappointed receiver announced that a number of trudeaus known assets including a home in ojai california would be auctioned with proceeds to be applied toward unpaid fines and restitutions the receiver also assumed control of trudeaus global information network gin the nevisbased secret club that had promised extraordinary secrets to success court officials informed gin members that the club’s business model “likely amounted to an illegal pyramid scheme and that its relentlessly publicized group of  billionaire financial advisors known as the “gin council” did not exist gins remaining assets were later auctioned as well in march  trudeau was sentenced to  years in prison an unusually lengthy term for a contempt conviction judge ronald guzman visibly irritated by trudeaus plea for leniency described him as deceitful to the core trudeau has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions  or at most impediments to be sidestepped outmaneuvered or just ignored guzman said that type of conduct simply cannot stand trudeau filed an appeal contending that a gettleman erred in ruling that trudeaus misrepresentations of the content of free money they dont want you to know about was in contempt of the court’s  order b that the district court abused its discretion when it ordered him to pay compensatory damages of  million and c further abused its discretion when it amended its  order to prohibit him from participating in infomercials promoting his books in february  a federal appeals court found no basis to accept trudeaus claims and ruled that the year sentence was reasonable given the size of trudeaus fraud and the flagrant and repetitive nature of his contumacious conduct trudeau is currently serving his sentence at the federal prison camp montgomery in alabama he maintains an active facebook page where he solicits donations for his defense fund and compares his imprisonment to that of nelson mandela in april  guzman ordered that royalties payable to trudeau from continuing sales of his books—now owned by a california company called free is my favorite llc which purchased the rights from trudeau—be forwarded to a governmentcontrolled trust and used for fine and restitution payments infomercials for free money they dont want you to know about produced and marketed by free is my favorite llc continue to run on television stations throughout the united states in october  gettleman approved a partial refund of about  million to more than  people who bought the weight loss cure they dont want you to know about other criticismsedit medical experienceedit one common criticism by consumer groups is that trudeau has had no medical training trudeau responds that by not having such training he is not biased toward pharmaceutical companies and the fda and that medical doctors are taught only how to write out prescriptions for poisons and cut out pieces of a persons anatomy unsubstantiated claimsedit trudeau has been criticized for his inability to provide evidence to back up his claims although he recites anecdotes he has never provided evidence evaluated by licensed medical practitioners in instances where trudeau has been asked to provide proof he has misinterpreted medical studies or cited dubious or fictitious studies for example trudeau cited a nonexistent year research study involving a natural cure for diabetes at the university of calgary when abc news correspondent jake tapper confronted him on nightline trudeau insisted that he had a copy of the study and would provide it he never did he later claimed in his infomercials that the university destroyed its findings to prevent reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry in  university of calgary officials announced in a public statement that none of trudeaus claims about the universitys research were true and that its attorneys had sent trudeau a cease and desist letter demanding that he stop associating himself with the school false endorsementsedit in august  the new york consumer protection board warned consumers that trudeau has used false claims of endorsements to promote his products noting that the back cover of natural cures includes false endorsements further the nycpb states that trudeaus television ads give the false impression that tammy faye messner opposes chemotherapy in favor of the natural cures in trudeaus book a representative for messner before her death from cancer said that was not true and that she was starting chemotherapy again the back cover includes the following quote from dr herbert ley a former commissioner of the us food and drug administration who died three years before the book was written the thing that bugs me is that people think the fda is protecting them it isnt what the fda is doing and what people think its doing are as different as night and day the statement extracted from a  new york times interview was made in the context of leys resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes trudeaus lawyer david j bradford says that this quote does not constitute a false endorsement of the book by ley but rather is merely a statement that is in line with the purpose of the book referencesedit  kevin trudeau banned from infomercials for three years ordered to pay more than  million for false claims about weightloss book
