capstone therapeutics – otcqb caps about capstone therapeutics corp capstone therapeutics corp the “company” or “we” is traded on the otcqb under the ticker symbol “caps”  we are a biotechnology company committed to developing a pipeline of novel peptides and other molecules aimed at helping patients with underserved medical conditions our primary asset is ownership in a joint venture development company called lipimetix development inc “lipimetix” or “jv” based in natick massachusetts  in  capstone invested  million in the joint venture for  ownership  our partners in the venture include three phd drug developers the university of alabama at birmingham research foundation “uabrf” and scientists at the university of alabama at birmingham “uab”  both capstone with two full time employees and the joint venture managed under consulting contract by benu biopharma operate virtual business models to maintain capital efficiency for our shareholders through funding provided by capstone lipimetix developed its first candidate peptide molecule aem through preclinical and human clinical phase a b and a studies   patients were enrolled in doubleblinded placebocontrolled studies at a clinical site in perth australia  aem was delivered in single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose formats to test safety tolerability and efficacy  the medical safety committee reviewing all safetyrelated aspects of the clinical trial observed a generally acceptable safety profile  of the firstinman study the primary endpoint was safety yet efficacy measurements analyzing pharmacodynamics yielded statistical significance in the pooled data set favoring aem vs placebo in multiple lipid biomarker endpoints especially vldl cholesterol and triglycerides  please see wwwlipimetixcom based upon aem’s clinically proven ability to rapidly reduce triglycerides and other lipoproteins we are targeting various clinical indications including acute pancreatitis with high triglycerides “tgs” homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or hofh genetic hypertriglyceridemia and other orphan dyslipidemic disease states acute pancreatitis with high triglycerides  in  we retained a consultancy to conduct a market assessment study for aem in acute pancreatitis “ap” with high triglycerides  the consultancy’s report concluded that the ap indication represents a significant unmet clinical need for a therapeutic that could rapidly reduce tgs  our consultant and market research literature cite an estimated  hospitalizations for all types of ap in the us each year with approximately  presenting with severe levels of tg equal to or greater than  mgdl  reducing tgs early in the onset of acute pancreatitis is a factor in shortening hospital stays and improving clinical outcomes according to pancreatologists and lipidologists who serve these patients  aem and its analogs may be an ideal therapeutic agent for this extremelyill patient population homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hofh  in  aem received orphan designation from fda for a rare disease indication called homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or hofh  this is a very small global population of individuals who are born with no ldl receptors in the liver and are unable to clear ldl the “bad” cholesterol through a natural pathway  historically these patients have experienced cardiovascular complications in their teens and twenties often leading to early death  standard of care therapy was a process called apheresis which is a mechanical filtering of the lipid fat from the patient’s entire blood volume akin to the kidney dialysis process  in  two pharmaceutical therapies were approved in the us aegerion’s juxtapid and sanofigenzyme’s kynamro  juxtapid has proven the market with an impressive revenue ramp while revenue data for kynamro is not publicly available  we believe that aem or the new analogs if approved could compete favorably with these other drugs due to potentially equivalent efficacy and an expectation of fewer and less severe side effects chimeric apolipoprotein e mimetic peptides  apolipoprotein e apo e is in a class of protein that occurs throughout the body  apo e is essential for the normal metabolism of cholesterol and triglycerides  after a meal the postprandial or postmeal lipid load is packaged in lipoproteins and secreted into the blood stream  apo e targets cholesterol and triglyceride rich lipoproteins to specific receptors in the liver decreasing the levels in the blood  elevated plasma cholesterol and triglycerides are independent risk factors for atherosclerosis the buildup of cholesterol rich lesions and plaques in the arteries  atherosclerosis is the major cause of cardiovascular disease peripheral artery disease and cerebral artery disease and can cause heart attack loss of limbs and stroke  defective lipid metabolism also plays an important role in the development of adult onset diabetes mellitus type  diabetes and diabetics are particularly vulnerable to atherosclerosis heart and peripheral artery diseases the uab scientists patented the first chimeric apo e mimetic peptide in  reducing the  amino acid native apo e into a smaller  amino acid dual domain peptide that can be delivered therapeutically  one domain inserts into a lipoprotein surface and the second domain binds to the apo e receptors in the liver  in  our jv’s founding scientist dr dennis goldberg obtained worldwide right to patents for apo e mimetic peptides from uabrf  the jv has an exclusive license agreement with uabrf for aem and its analogs concurrent with the development activities with aem the jv has performed limited preclinical studies that have identified an analog of aem referred to as aem and a formulation that has the potential of higher efficacy and higher dose toleration in preclinical models  a fresh composition of matter patent application was filed in july  with the us patent and trademark office for aem and a broad domain of analogs other business  previously we were focused on the development and commercialization of two product platforms  azx and chrysalin tp  since march  we no longer have any interest in or rights to chrysalin  in  we terminated the license agreement for azx intellectual property and returned all interest in and rights to the azx intellectual property to the licensor azte the jv and company intend to explore fundraising partnering or licensing to obtain additional funding to continue development activities of new leading candidate aem  the jv and the company do not have sufficient funding at this time to continue additional material development activities of aem and its analogs or other operations  the jv may conduct future clinical trials in australia the usa and other regulatory jurisdictions if regulatory approvals additional funding and other conditions permit the company intends funding permitting to continue limiting its internal operations to a virtual operating model while monitoring and participating in the management of lipimetix’s development activities     connect with uscapstonethx facebook google linkedin the

no longer have any interest in or rights to chrysalin on august   we entered into a joint venture lipimetix development llc the “jv” to develop apo e mimetic peptide molecule aem and its analogs in  we wound down internal operations ceased clinical development of azx in dermal scarring formerly our principal drug candidate and moved to a more virtual operating model certain manufacturing and regulatory activities related to azx that are required either from a statutory perspective or for reporting purposes will continue we are also performing limited preclinical studies with azx in fibrosis we are currently seeking development partnering or licensing opportunities for azx in dermal scarring pulmonary fibrosis and peridural fibrosis the jv has a development plan to pursue regulatory approval of aem as treatment for severe refractory hypercholesterolemia and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia granted orphan drug designation by fda in  the initial development plan will extend through phase a and ba clinical trials and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of  the clinical trials will have a safety primary endpoint and an efficacy endpoint targeting reduction of ldl and nonhdl cholesterol regulatory filings were made by the jv in both canada and australia seeking allowance to commence the proposed clinical trials the proposed clinical trials for aem are randomized doubleblinded placebocontrolled studies to evaluate the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single ascending doses phase a in healthy patients with elevated cholesterol and multiple ascending doses phase ba in patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia the phase a clinical trial will consist of  patients and the phase ba is expected to consist of

vascular back to top capstone therapeutics – otcqb caps about capstone therapeutics corp capstone therapeutics corp the “company” or “we” is traded on the otcqb under the ticker symbol “caps”  we are a biotechnology company committed to developing a pipeline of novel peptides and other molecules aimed at helping patients with underserved medical conditions our primary asset is ownership in a joint venture development company called lipimetix development inc “lipimetix” or “jv” based in natick massachusetts  in  capstone invested  million in the joint venture for  ownership  our partners in the venture include three phd drug developers the university of alabama at birmingham research foundation “uabrf” and scientists at the university of alabama at birmingham “uab”  both capstone with two full time employees and the joint venture managed under consulting contract by benu biopharma operate virtual business models to maintain capital efficiency for our shareholders through funding provided by capstone lipimetix developed its first candidate peptide molecule aem through preclinical and human clinical phase a b and a studies   patients were enrolled in doubleblinded placebocontrolled studies at a clinical site in perth australia  aem was delivered in single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose formats to test safety tolerability and efficacy  the medical safety committee reviewing all safetyrelated aspects of the clinical trial observed a generally acceptable safety profile  of the firstinman study the primary endpoint was safety yet efficacy measurements analyzing pharmacodynamics yielded statistical significance in the pooled data set favoring aem vs placebo in multiple lipid biomarker endpoints especially vldl cholesterol and triglycerides  please see wwwlipimetixcom based upon aem’s clinically proven ability to rapidly reduce triglycerides and other lipoproteins we are targeting various clinical indications including acute pancreatitis with high triglycerides “tgs” homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or hofh genetic hypertriglyceridemia and other orphan dyslipidemic disease states acute pancreatitis with high triglycerides  in  we retained a consultancy to conduct a market assessment study for aem in acute pancreatitis “ap” with high triglycerides  the consultancy’s report concluded that the ap indication represents a significant unmet clinical need for a therapeutic that could rapidly reduce tgs  our consultant and market research literature cite an estimated  hospitalizations for all types of ap in the us each year with approximately  presenting with severe levels of tg equal to or greater than  mgdl  reducing tgs early in the onset of acute pancreatitis is a factor in shortening hospital stays and improving clinical outcomes according to pancreatologists and lipidologists who serve these patients  aem and its analogs may be an ideal therapeutic agent for this extremelyill patient population homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hofh  in  aem received orphan designation from fda for a rare disease indication called homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or hofh  this is a very small global population of individuals who are born with no ldl receptors in the liver and are unable to clear ldl the “bad” cholesterol through a natural pathway  historically these patients have experienced cardiovascular complications in their teens and twenties often leading to early death  standard of care therapy was a process called apheresis which is a mechanical filtering of the lipid fat from the patient’s entire blood volume akin to the kidney dialysis process  in  two pharmaceutical therapies were approved in the us aegerion’s juxtapid and sanofigenzyme’s kynamro  juxtapid has proven the market with an impressive revenue ramp while revenue data for kynamro is not publicly available  we believe that aem or the new analogs if approved could compete favorably with these other drugs due to potentially equivalent efficacy and an expectation of fewer and less severe side effects chimeric apolipoprotein e mimetic peptides  apolipoprotein e apo e is in a class of protein that occurs throughout the body  apo e is essential for the normal metabolism of cholesterol and triglycerides  after a meal the postprandial or postmeal lipid load is packaged in lipoproteins and secreted into the blood stream  apo e targets cholesterol and triglyceride rich lipoproteins to specific receptors in the liver decreasing the levels in the blood  elevated plasma cholesterol and triglycerides are independent risk factors for atherosclerosis the buildup of cholesterol rich lesions and plaques in the arteries  atherosclerosis is the major cause of cardiovascular disease peripheral artery disease and cerebral artery disease and can cause heart attack loss of limbs and stroke  defective lipid metabolism also plays an important role in the development of adult onset diabetes mellitus type  diabetes and diabetics are particularly vulnerable to atherosclerosis heart and peripheral artery diseases the uab scientists patented the first chimeric apo e mimetic peptide in  reducing the  amino acid native apo e into a smaller  amino acid dual domain peptide that can be delivered therapeutically  one domain inserts into a lipoprotein surface and the second domain binds to the apo e receptors in the liver  in  our jv’s founding scientist dr dennis goldberg obtained worldwide right to patents for apo e mimetic peptides from uabrf  the jv has an exclusive license agreement with uabrf for aem and its analogs concurrent with the development activities with aem the jv has performed limited preclinical studies that have identified an analog of aem referred to as aem and a formulation that has the potential of higher efficacy and higher dose toleration in preclinical models  a fresh composition of matter patent application was filed in july  with the us patent and trademark office for aem and a broad domain of analogs other business  previously we were focused on the development and commercialization of two product platforms  azx and chrysalin tp  since march  we no longer have any interest in or rights to chrysalin  in  we terminated the license agreement for azx intellectual property and returned all interest in and rights to the azx intellectual property to the licensor azte the jv and company intend to explore fundraising partnering or licensing to obtain additional funding to continue development activities of new leading candidate aem  the jv and the company do not have sufficient funding at this time to continue additional material development activities of aem and its analogs or other operations  the jv may conduct future clinical trials in australia the usa and other regulatory jurisdictions if regulatory approvals additional funding and other conditions permit the company intends funding permitting to continue limiting its internal operations to a virtual operating model while monitoring and participating in the management of lipimetix’s development activities     connect with uscapstonethx facebook google linkedin the
