acquired sweetiq analytics for an undisclosed sumsweetiq has created a platform for localoriented businesses to manage their digital presence reputation and engage their customers and prospectsgannett hopes to leverage the capabilities in its reachlocal division as it competes with companies such as yext for retailer online information management quick take media company gannett gci has acquired sweetiq analytics for an undisclosed amount sweetiq has developed a ‘local marketing system’ for businesses with a suite of solutions for marketing and reputation management gannett joins a competitive market space with recent ipo company yext in a quest to be the ‘onestop shop’ to help localoriented businesses manage their digital information target company montreal canadabased sweetiq was founded in  by ceo mohannan elbarachi and cro michael mire to help retail chains and marketing agencies standardize company information across the internet and increase customer engagement across social channels to drive sales growth the company’s suite of products include local listings management store locatormicrosites review management advanced local campaigns data analytics location manager below is a brief demo video about sweetiq’s approach to the shopper journey source sweet iq the company raised at least  million in two known rounds primarily from canadabased investors such as plaza venture matthew leibowitz real ventures retail group and others sweetiq’s customer base includes local businesses and fortune  brands with numerous locations throughout the us and canada acquisition terms neither company disclosed the amount or terms of the deal gannett did not file an k with the sec so it is reasonable to assume that the deal amount was not material to its financial operations as of december   gannett had  million in cash and net receivables and  billion in total liabilities so it would appear that the company had ample resources to pay for this acquisition gannett plans to integrate sweetiq’s solutions into its reachlocal suite of digital marketing products rationale and commentary in the acquisition announcement gannett stated the acquisition accelerates the company’s product roadmap and enhances its ability to help businesses measure results of their digital marketing investments furthermore reachlocal ceo sharon rowlands said of the deal businesses want to work with one company that they can trust to help them with all of their digital marketing efforts this acquisition adds strong product offerings in local listings and reputation management to our suite of digital marketing solutions and strengthens our value proposition with multilocation and national brands by adding sweetiq to our portfolio we can further provide our customers with datadriven insights that drive realworld results so gannett clearly wants to be that ‘one company’ that can provide a comprehensive group of offerings to retailers of any size this type of service is similar to that of recent ipo yext yext i wrote of yext’s business and ipo prospects in my article yext sets proposed terms for  million ipo in that article i highlighted numerous competitors such as moz local synup vendasta locu manta and localsitesubmit i also noted yext’s slowing revenue growth and rapidly increasing sales  marketing and ga expenses as reasons to avoid the ipo now gannett’s acquisition of sweetiq brings another worthy competitor to the space time will tell if legacy publisher gannett can finalize its transition from analog to digital and make inroads in
