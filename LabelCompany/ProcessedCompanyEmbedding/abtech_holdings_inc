media technology called smart sponge it has developed and patented its smart sponge technologies based on a blend of synthetic polymers focused at the removal of hydrocarbons and oil derivatives from surface water smart sponge products remove pollutants from water and encapsulate them so that they cannot be released back into the water even under high pressure abtech industries polymers consist of amorphous products that are able to absorb hydrocarbons contaminants present in water then stabilize and retain them in a gelified structure its polymers in order to remove oil derivatives from water are oleophilic strong affinity for oils and hydrophobic repel watersmart sponge plusthe company offers smart sponge technology with an antimicrobial agent in reducing coliform bacteria found in storm water industrial wastewater and municipal wastewater while maintaining its oilabsorbing capability this technology known as smart sponge plus provides a solution to municipalities and other entities faced with beach closures and other hazards of bacterialaden storm water the antimicrobial agent used for this technology is an organosilane derivative that is used in the fields including medical consumables pool equipment and consumer goods the antimicrobial mechanism of smart sponge plus is based on the agents electromagnetic interaction with the microorganism cell membrane causing the disruption of the cell wall of the microorganism but no chemical or physical change in the agentsmart sponge hmthe company has exclusively licensed a heavy metals removal technology from synanomet llc

pollution and contamination today reported financial results for its first quarter ended march       key first quarter  financial results summary revenues for the first quarter of  were approximately  including  for the companys first sale of filters containing its new heavy metals filtration media smart sponge hm compared to revenues of  for the same period of the previous year and  in the fourth quarter of   although revenue during the first quarter of  is predominantly attributed to stormwater product applications abtechs commercial and industrial opportunity pipeline and planned pilot projects have been active during the first quarter of  the monthly cash burn for the first quarter  averaged approximately  a decrease from the average monthly cash burn during the first quarter of  of  operating expenses totaled  million in first quarter of  an increase of  over first quarter of  and an increase of  over fourth quarter  due predominately to an increase in legal fees in the first quarter of  operating loss for the first quarter of  totaled  million compared to an operating loss of  million for the same period of the prior year and an operating loss of  in the fourth quarter of  in  abtech has continued its activity with several water treatment field trials of note prepared for nd field test of evaporative technology for produced and frac flowback water with focus on emissions successfully completed a smart sponge® hydrocarbon removal and recycling of spent media demonstration in a produced water application for our colombian distributor advancing discussions to economics and design issues achieved low phosphorus results on a sanitary wastewater application in china with a larger pilot scale demonstration scheduled for june  and during the first quarter the company received cash advances totaling  from a related party investor subsequent to quarterend the company received an additional  in shortterm funding from this investor  marked a year of corporate restructuring with a cleanup of our balance sheet a broadening of our treatment capabilities to include heavy metals development and an expansion of the focus of our business to include industrial and commercial market segments  during  we focused on educating our target markets and customers about our capabilities to help them meet new regulatory requirements reestablished our presence at the most notable and heavily trafficked trade shows reengaged in active marketing and social media presence and dynamically sought opportunities for testing and pilot projects today with strong data and proven results from pilots and test projects addressing water contamination issues within several industries globally under varied conditions we are now attempting to convert these past efforts into positive revenue results commented jeff gutierrez abtechs vice president of sales  an important potential early industrial revenue contributor exists through abtechs distributor in colombia south america klima projects sas klima  after working together for over a year and applying smart sponge media to remove hydrocarbons in produced water klima is advancing it sales effort with two large energy companies  klima has made tremendous progress educating the oil and gas industry on uses of smart sponge media to reduce operating costs and meet new discharge regulations that came into effect during  a second potential early contributor to commercialindustrial revenues is the low cost onsite vaporization technology designed to treat produced water including frac flowback water reducing the volume by greater than  and returning the water back to the environment in the form of water vapor  over the past  months abtech has made numerous modifications to its prototype unit which uses thin film direct convection in a closed reaction chamber  this thermal process can use as its energy source the flare gas or wellhead gas available at the oil and gas production site  the technology is designed to be straightforward and robust in order to be reliable under very difficult operating conditions  the initial field trial was concluded in middecember  during which several improvements were identified to enhance the customer experience improve operation and meet anticipated regulatory clean air act emissions requirements  all modifications are being incorporated into an upgraded prototype unit which is planned to be redeployed for a second pilot field trial in the second and third quarter  within the stormwater business segment abtech is seeing an upswing in interest for design build projects  while the company has several larger project opportunities for vault systems addressing industrial customers needs the more immediate sales continue to be smaller in nature   an important and growing opportunity for abtech is in deploying its new heavy metals media for heavy metal and orthophosphate removal in stormwater  this technology could be particularly relevant in areas with intense regulatory oversight and pressure to reduce sediment and nutrients flowing into key water bodies such as reducing phosphorous in lakes in california  abtech recognized its first stormwater sale which integrated smart sponge hm within its ultra urban® filters product line during first quarter   a focus for abtech over the past year has been in cultivating opportunities that address industrial process water  projects focused on oil discharge and removal within the shipping industry as well as selenium removal from process water in the beverage industry have some of the greatest nearer term opportunity for the company during   abtech reported net revenues for the three months ended march   of approximately  compared to  for the same period of the previous year and  in the fourth quarter of   all revenues recognized in the first quarter of  were related to stormwater product applications  revenues have not yet benefited from the redirected sales effort toward commercial and industrial applications  abtech incurred a loss from operations of  million for the three months ended march   versus a loss from operations of  million in the same period of the prior year and a loss from operations of  in the fourth quarter  the company reported a net loss of  million for the three months ended march   this compares to the previous years first quarter net loss of  million and  for the fourth quarter of   the net loss per share and net loss attributable to controlling interest per share for these periods is less than one cent  abtech reported a negative gross profit in the first quarter of  of approximately  compared to a negative gross profit of approximately  during the first quarter of  and gross profit of approximately  in the fourth quarter of   the negative gross margin in the first quarter of  and  was caused by the cost of excess manufacturing capacity the company operated at approximately  of production capacity in the first quarter of both  and  selling general and administrative sga expenses for the three months ended march   totaled  million an increase of approximately   over the prior year first quarter due primarily to legal fees of approximately   associated with the companys responses to subpoenas received by the company and some of its officers and directors in  and  from the securities and exchange commission sec and an investigation by the new york joint commission on public ethics jcope  this compares to  of similar legal fees incurred in the first quarter of   excluding these unusual legal expenses other sga expenses decreased by approximately  in the first quarter of  compared to the same period in prior year due largely to reduced payroll costs travel expenses board compensation and consulting fees in   research and development rd expenses decreased by approximately   to approximately  for the three months ended march   as compared to the same period of the prior year and a decrease of approximately   over the fourth quarter of  the lower rd expenses in  were primarily attributable to a reduction in payroll costs as well as lower costs associated with work conducted to develop and test the companys evaporation technology intended for use in the treatment of produced water at oil and gas drilling sites  costs for the evaporator technology are expected to increase significantly in the second quarter of  as the company continues its development efforts and modification of a prototype unit interest expense for the three months ended march   totaled approximately  compared to  in the same period of  and approximately  in the fourth quarter of   the first quarter  increase in interest expense was due to increased outstanding loans from investors including an increase of  during the first quarter of  accruing interest at a rate of  per annum at march   the company reported cash and cash equivalents of approximately  accounts receivable of  and inventory of   the monthly cash burn from operations for the first three months of  averaged approximately  a reduction of  from the prior year first quarter  at march   abtechs long term debt totaled approximately   the companys short term debt including accrued interest totaled approximately  million an increase of approximately  from the yearend  balance due primarily to the receipt of several cash advances made by a related party investor to fund first quarter working capital  subsequent to march   this related party investor advanced the company an additional  bringing the total due to investors for these cash advances to approximately   on march   abtech had approximately  million shares of common stock outstanding consistent with yearend  the companys fully diluted share count decreased by approximately  million shares during first quarter  as compared to year end  to approximately  million shares inclusive of all options warrants and convertible debt largely due to expiration of approximately  million warrants and  options  in addition the repayment of approximately  of convertible debt in the first quarter of  resulted in a reduction of approximately  of shares reserved for conversion of such
