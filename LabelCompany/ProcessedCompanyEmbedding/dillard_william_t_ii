american born june   education university of arkansas bsba  harvard university mba  family son of william t dillard deceased founder of dillards and alexa homemaker maiden name unknown married mandy maiden name unknown career dillards – position unknown executive vice president – president and chief operating officer – chief executive officer – chairman of the board – address dillards department stores  cantrell road little rock arkansas  httpwwwdillardscom ■ william dillard ii began his career in  at dillards the company his father william t had founded in  in little rock arkansas dillards is known as an upscale department store chain and by  ranked number three in the united states with dillard family members owning  percent of the voting stock and electing twothirds of the companys directors william dillard ii was named executive vice president in  rising to the position of chief executive officer by  he made his mark on the company almost immediately through the introduction of computers in the s dillard took the company through its largest acquisition with the  billion purchase of mercantile stores company in  despite criticism from industry analysts that they risked becoming a discount chain dillards also initiated its own brand of clothing in  to help reduce debt while increasing sales dillard was criticized for not being aggressive enough in slashing prices when inventory did not sell and possessing a weaker management style than his father he and his younger brothers adamantly refused to sell the company despite falling sales and stock prices and open criticism from nonfamily stockholders inheriting the good and bad from a familyowned business dillard grew up as the oldest son of a retailing pioneer at the time of his birth dillards had been operating for seven years dillards father ran the company with an iron fist and groomed all five of his sons to take over management roles as they came of age after receiving degrees in business from the university of arkansas and harvard dillard immediately began working for the family business where he received all of his retail training under the watchful eye of his father many critics of dillards noted the familys penchant for keeping the status quo and not allowing anyone else into the familys inner circle of running the business in  forbes referred to the family as insulated and private even though the company went public two years after dillard began working there its structure remained a dualclass stock where the family owned the majority of voting stock yet retained a small percentage of the company in  the dillard family owned  percent of the company but held  percent of the voting stock they also kept control of the board by placing family members on it the elder dillard held the chairmans position until  when he turned over the reins to his eldest son as the retailing market changed in the s dillard remained loyal to his fathers example of holding on to inventory and waiting too long to mark down outofseason items when the company began losing profits steadily each quarter by the end of the decade however dillard began to introduce new strategies in an effort to reduce debt and bring dillards back to the retail giant once dubbed in  a company with profit margins that would knock your eyes out as quoted in forbes  september   dillard makes strides within the industry dillard made his mark in the company by introducing data processing as early as  when he became the executive vice president dillards was at the forefront of computerizing purchase orders dillard was also praised for being a computer whiz long before other companies began using computers in  dillard made a surprising move for the company which had typically bought stores on the cheap he made a bid for mercantile stores in  for  billion in cash dillard won the bid but analysts claimed the company paid too much which caused dillards to accumulate a high level of debt dillard ended instore promotions and stopped an easygoing return policy at mercantile stores both of those customerfriendly policies had been the hallmark of mercantile by  arkansas business noted that the acquisition was disappointing and resulted in damaging the companys stock price dillard blamed the poor performance on losing time to consolidating mercantile stores into dillards dillard began in  to make up for the mercantile purchase by selectively buying one store at a time in malls where businesses had exited or closed in some locations this gave dillards two anchor stores within one mall each one specializing in different departments dillard called this a doubleheader dillards led the industry with these doubleheader stores with two anchor stores in  different malls by may  the ownership of real estate by dillards continued to be the companys strong point as it struggled to keep pace with the changes in the retail industry analysts noted that investors seemed more interested in the land holdings than in sales when profits plunged in  and  experts noted not only that dillard has continued to make wise decisions on real estate but also that the location of the properties has been a positive for the company by  dillards owned  percent of its stores making it a company with a strong book value unlike other chains that lease most of their stores dillard starts a private label with discount retailers taking business away from the malloriented stores such as dillards by the end of the s dillard began making decisions that seemed aggressive compared with the strategies previously employed by the company developing a private brand of merchandise led to a rise in sales by  when the brand was first introduced many thought it would hurt dillards by making the stores more of a discount chain others felt the move would improve sales one industry insider said that dillards started its privatelabel program before many other chains which helped them get a boost on the competition dillard was praised for offering customers a choice between the core brands and their own brand which was discounted other analysts said that consumers are obsessed with known brandname labels and criticized dillards for attempting to give consumers something they did not want to buy dillard told shareholders in  that the company sought the perfect balance between the known labels and private ones by  the strategy had paid off with the private label steadily increasing its profits to  percent of total store sales however the old problem left over from the elder dillard continued to plague the company large amounts of inventory and huge markdowns hit the gross profit margins hard insiders said the markdowns were so drastic because dillard waited too long to make the decision to discount the overabundant inventory at the end of the season dillards became desperate to move the merchandise and slashed prices too low despite increasing sales of the private label this other strategy left the company in a sales slide by mid along with its private label dillard also instituted a policy to help move merchandise faster at the end of the season the movement of items out of the store helped stabilize the profit margins dillard increased the privatelabel merchandise and negotiated upfront vendor allowances forbes noted in  that dillards had made strides with these decisions dillard closed unprofitable stores while reducing staff arkansas business said in  that these new strategies had finally taken hold to improve the net income despite dropped net sales dillard said in a press release we consider our accomplishments in the fourth quarter fiscal year  to be solid affirmation that we are on the right track with our strategies march   private even with stockholders dillards career cannot be separated from the successes and failures of the company critics often lambasted the man and the company for the lack of communication with the media industry analysts and shareholders forbes noted in an article in  that dillard refused to be interviewed for the story he made it a policy never to comment on criticisms and speculations regarding the company one of the shareholders did speak to forbes for the article complaining about managements lack of response to written requests for information thomas jackson a managing director of prudential investment corporation was the secondlargest shareholder in  owning  percent of dillards stock jackson told forbes that even though he was disgusted with what he perceived as arrogance he held on to his stock hoping dillard would make the decision to sell the company when the founder of dillards died in  many insiders speculated that his son would make the decision either to sell or to make significant changes in the policies governing the company the speculation occurred because the elder dillard was seen as the spiritual guide of the company despite his sons appointment as ceo in  an editorial in arkansas business in  said that even wall street was betting the heirs would sell the company dillard although reticent to speak to the media had sent word through friends that the family remained committed to dillards and entertained no ideas of selling dillard said he kept shareholders informed on the companys status at the annual meetings and held conference calls with investors and any other interested parties the media included on a regular basis he issued a statement after the forbes piece came out noting that what some refer to as snubbing he called fair disclosure by  however investors were concerned that dillard had not participated in the last four conference calls held despite the investors request that dillard be present robert buchanan an analyst for a g edwards told the americas intelligence wire on september   in the interest of the shareholders he dillard should sell the company analysts blamed dillards lack of forthrightness as one of the reasons that forecasting the earnings of the company was nearly impossible this secretiveness kept wall street wary management styles analysts praised dillard and his handson style of management during his early years as president nothing reached the floor for sale until dillard had made a decision about it in  dillard was praised for creating market dominance for the company through his computer system which led to higher efficiency however criticisms regarding managements conservative approach to change began to surface despite the innovation in tracking merchandise through computerized files what had once worked for dillards in the s no longer helped because the nature of retail stores changed in the s dillard made some adjustments but he remained steadfast to his fathers original strategies even with dire predictions from industry analysts as of  as dillard began to change strategies toward privatelabel brands and realestate acquisition profits fluctuated for the decade from  to  when the elder dillard died in  speculation that dillard and his brothers would sell the company created ups and downs in stock valuations while the changes dillard instituted did help profit margins some of the same criticisms of managements style remained forbes magazine charged in  that dillard hung on stubbornly to the belief that the family could handle the downturn in sales the magazine said dillard lacked his fathers business sense in  analysts said that sales fell because the company had waited too long to lower prices on summer stock by  moodys investors services expressed anxiety over the value of dillards performance and its ability to recover see also entry on dillard department stores inc in international directory of company histories  sources for further information dillards

of leadership model upper tiers which are transformational rather that transactional• intrinsic cultural revolutiono restructure the companies culture from the insideo merit and equity would be strong deciderso lead the path to employee satisfactionmotivationextrinsic motivationthe first glaring flaw in the dillard’s system is the failure to use a solid pay structurenew hires are often paid more than experienced workers with the same qualificationsdisproportionate pay leads to employee frustration and poor job performancesales per hour quotas  pay cutsintrinsic motivation“some research suggests financial incentives may be more motivating in the short term but in the long run its nonfinancial incentives” with dillard’s the consensus is that little to no training is provided and employees are often unprepared or underequippedlack of training leads to no increase in self efficacy therefore workers are less motivatedhigh turnover rate causes low employee morale and a low sense of securityneed for achievement stifled due to lack of promotion opportunitieshow to improvefirst there needs to be a clearly defined pay scale to ensure equity among employees a training system that improves employee skill and thus increases selfefficacy should also be implementeda new reward or commission based pay system should also be implemented for the sales force “rewards should be contingent on performance and employees must perceive the link between the two regardless of how strong the relationship is if individuals perceive it to be weak the results will be low performance a decrease in job satisfaction and an increase in turnover and absenteeism”dillardsamanda rae rodriguezmaribel solisjose mendezarthur barberteam lionthank you for watchingfull transcriptmore
