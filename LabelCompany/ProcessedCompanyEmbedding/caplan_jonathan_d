thursday april 4  at the community college of rhode island in warwick ri steven senne ap garrison keillorspecial to the washington post its good to hear that bill clinton will be put in charge of revitalizing the economy in a hillary administration and be sent to troubled areas such as appalachian coal country and innercity detroit and not just promote literacy or physical fitness the usual first lady things but i hope that at state dinners and other major white house events well be able to read about what hes wearingmr clinton captivated attention with his formfitting paleblue vargas jacket with asymmetrical side vents and matching trousers pleated with empire waist and halfinch slanted cuffs mauvestriped silk shirt with rounded collar and coralred tie sequined but it was his footwear the moccasins no socks that had the crowd all atwitter a spokesperson for the first gentleman declined to comment just because youre in charge of revitalization doesnt mean you have to go around in a cape with blue tights and a big red s on your chest and red underwear over the tights a man should be able to wear a light dacronlinen blend suit now and then too maybe with a bold bluestriped shirt and an orange polkadotted tie art caplan jonathan d moreno as unusual as the  presidential election has been one obvious aspect has gone largely unnoticed by the time the next

has been one obvious aspect has gone largely unnoticed by the time the next president of the united states is inaugurated on jan   he or she will have reached or come close to reaching  years old that all the remaining major candidates art caplan jonathan d moreno let me say what nobody has said in print for eight years barack obama looks terrific he is slim athletic and you never see him looking slovenly even in casual dress he looks very well put together he never gets credit for this i guess the washington press corps thinks it would trivialize the role of leader of the free world to discuss his choice of necktie if the big snapper is elected in november this will change he’ll be wearing his own labels and product placement will be very important in his administration even huge bill clinton is looking good too as no 4 he was overweight pastyfaced and sweaty and now thanks to a timely health scare he looks like a million bucks why shouldnt he dress up a little for centuries men have felt obliged to look dumpy as a mark of superior intelligence and go slouching around in baggy brown suits and unruly hair so people will think theyre too brilliant to ever think about their appearance einstein was responsible the genius who looked like a tramp advertising men and interior decorators were allowed to dress up as befitting their trades but a novelist such as myself had to wear jeans and black tshirts to be taken seriously as a chronicler of postmodern despair now that i am a newspaper columnist i am free to look however i feel today i am wearing a traditional mackayplaid kilt with black knee socks and a dagger in my left shoe while barechested except for a leather bandolier and a necklace of wolf teeth next week it may be a velvet tuxedoeverybody is wondering if white men will vote for hillary and speaking as a white man i say it depends a lot on bill if he looks happy on the sidelines gazing up at her with dewyeyed admiration then yes we white men are looking to expand our mission we built the bridges made the trains run on time raised the flag at iwo jima and taught highschool physics while writing novels pitching nohitters and singing our way into the hearts of millions and now wed like to relax a little we are overrepresented in statuary and on american currency andrew jackass get the hell off the  bill and now wed like to assume a lesser rolewe white men are primarily responsible for good humor this is true women are ambitious elbowing each other for advantage and minority men are satirists and shrewd observers and we white guys are the ones responsible for chuckling and saying “hey hows it going” we are pretty secure in this role put us in a fitandflare floral shirt and leather slacks and black pumps and were ok with that too it doesnt mean we want to use the womens bathroomthe election is simple it comes down to the town librarian versus the town drunk the republicans try to portray her as the dragon lady but if youve ever heard her speak you recognize her essential librarian nature the big question is bill can he be happy even as he revitalizes the stripmined ruins of appalachia and burntout blocks of detroit and go off to the kennedy center looking good in a midnight blue armani tuxedo with a honeydew shirt accented by diamond studs and cuff links and a metallic silver bow tie with flecks of

need unbiased medical exams for presidential candidates biddiboo getty images biddiboo getty images art caplan jonathan d moreno as unusual as the  presidential election has been one obvious aspect has gone largely unnoticed by the time the next president of the united states is inaugurated on jan   he or she will have reached or come close to reaching  years oldthat all the remaining major candidates are among the young old at this stage of the election process is unprecedented yet in spite of the stakes for the american people there is no independent source that can provide an adequate accounting of the medical condition of the next presidenthistorians have examined the ways that previous administrations have been affected by the medical problems of presidents including abraham lincoln william henry harrison woodrow wilson franklin roosevelt john kennedy lyndon johnson and ronald reagan the news has not always been positiveso what have we done to help independently vet those who would lead the most powerful nation on earth nothing currently the candidates release information produced by their own doctors entirely at their discretion the most amusing recent example is a letter signed by donald trumps personal physician that failed to include any data and simply assured us that he will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency this is unlikely to prove true considering the remarkable fitness of george w bush and barack obama whose physical examinations while president were made publichillary clintons doctors letter was far more detailed and persuasive including a summary of her medical history current medications results of routine medical tests for blood pressure and cholesterol and her diet and exercise routine bernie sanders has released a similar letter from congress attending physician but in every case the doctors were chosen by the candidates editorial board life is full of unpleasant but inescapable obligations paying your taxes laughing at your boss jokes waiting for the cable guy some tasks are even more unpleasant but thankfully optional for republican officeholders and candidates endorsing donald trump for president falls into the latter life is full of unpleasant but inescapable obligations paying your taxes laughing at your boss jokes waiting for the cable guy some tasks are even more unpleasant but thankfully optional for republican officeholders and candidates endorsing donald trump for president falls into the latter editorial board arent voters owed an independent accounting even competent physicians judgments and recommendations can vary especially when they know what the stakes are for their wannabepresident patients one of the rationales for our interminable election process is that it enables the voters to get to know the views and temperaments of the candidates what about their physical capacity for the job we might like to think that the rigors of a lengthy and strenuous campaign can give us such insight but the candidates physical capacities might be masked by medication health management that could be a more serious liability when in officeour system invests so much authority in a single individual as head of state chief executive of the federal government and commander in chief that the ways in which any medical conditions might affect performance must be explored by a process that doesnt allow for selfcensorship an independent examination by a panel of physicians at say walter reed national military medical center would at least provide voters with some trustworthy information the results might influence not only the voters thinking but also the selection of a vice president whose heartbeat away status might become much more intensely apparent editorial board if you think of the presidential primaries as a hiring process for nominees the republican party is about to offer the job to donald trump as they say in the executive suite when a personnel crisis arises alert the folks in human resources while there was plenty of interest in the presidential if you think of the presidential primaries as a hiring process for nominees the republican party is about to offer the job to donald trump as they say in the executive suite when a personnel crisis arises alert the folks in human resources while there was plenty of interest in the presidential editorial board our proposal would apply to all presidential candidates regardless of age and to the presidents themselves while in office we recognize that in creating a requirement for independent assessment some will call for more than the standard physical and mental clinical information at an extreme given the capacities of modern medical science some may even want to see a genomic analysis someday a deep genetic dive might be defensible though that day is not quite here today there are wellestablished conventions for a physical examination that have earned prognostic credibilitywith so much at stake an independent medical assessment not controlled by the candidates seems very little to ask all voters may not care about the health status of the candidates but the information should be availablearthur caplan is a professor of bioethics at new york university langone medical center jonathan d moreno is a professor of ethics at the university of pennsylvania
