markets – global x funds searching for growth in emerging markets given high valuations and sluggish growth among the developed markets many investors are looking to the emerging markets for potential returns yet we believe popular market capitalizationweighted emerging market indexes dilute the highgrowth opportunities in the emerging markets that investors are seeking one cause for this “dilution” is due to the fact that market capweighting schemes tend to overweight the countries that have already experienced periods of rapid growth and are now decelerating as they mature into middleincome economies for example as of december   the brics brazil russia india and china south korea and taiwan made up nearly  of the msci emerging markets index but demonstrated an average gdp growth rate of just  during that same year at the inception  of the msci emerging markets index the average gdp growth rates for these six countries was  the year rolling average gdp chart below shows that since the late s these countries have experienced a downward trend of economic expansion source knoema  gdp data from  to  while traditional emerging market indexes may be overexposed to these slowing economies it’s possible that investors could consider two alternative approaches in an effort to zeroin on the higher growth potential opportunities that remain within the emerging markets a broad approach that focuses on the less advanced developing markets – the next emerging and frontier countries and a targeted approach that isolates specific sectors within the larger emerging markets such as the chinese consumer and technology sectors a focus on less developed countries the next emerging and frontier markets many investors prefer accessing a variety of emerging markets simultaneously to help mitigate the idiosyncratic risks associated with any one economy in order to maintain broad exposure to the emerging market asset class while increasing its growth potential investors might consider shifting their focus away from the largest emerging markets and focus in on the less developed emerging and frontier markets this strategy which is the basis for the global x next emerging  frontier etf emfm avoids  major middleincome economies brazil russia india china south korea and taiwan ‘bric  st’ emfm solely focuses on the less developed category of the ‘next’ emerging  frontier countries ‘next em  fm’ the next emerging  frontier markets make up only  of the msci emerging markets index  of which are frontier markets portion but often have attractive characteristics such as large growing populations vast natural resources and low market capitalization to gdp ratios the combined population in the next em  fm countries are the largest in the world and forecast to expand at twice as fast as the bric  st countries and four times as fast as developed economies coupling these demographics with  lower labor costs than the bric st countries it’s possible that the next em  fm countries could benefit from a demographic tailwind which might accelerate their growth source global x research based country data from oecd numbeo  while the next em  fm countries tend to have lower amounts of fixed assets and capital than their more developed peers they are often rich in natural resources exporting these commodities to developed markets attracts foreign capital that can be used to improve public services like education and healthcare to develop better infrastructure and to import new technologies for example over time reinvesting this capital can help to close the economic gap between the next em  fm countries and the rest of the world source global x research based country data from unctad  the next em  fm countries demonstrate the lowest market cap to gdp ratio which is a measure about which warren buffett once said “is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment” this ratio tends to move towards  as a country’s capital markets mature and become fully priced given the comparatively low market cap to gdp ratio the capital markets in the next em  fm could be on a track to expand with additional ipos and rising market caps source world bank  target sector exposures china consumer and technology rather than entirely eliminating the bric  st countries from an emerging market allocation investors could opt to target just the higher growth segments of these economies for example while china’s broad economic growth is generally slowing the country is in the midst of a substantial transition from its ‘old economy’ characterized by often inefficient stateowned enterprises and investment in fixedassets to a ‘new economy’ led by domestic consumption this transition could create a substantial opportunity within the consumer and technology sectors which have the potential to benefit from the rising spending power of chinese consumersshoppers in  household final consumption accounted for approximately  of china’s total gdp this figure is well below the  average for similar middleincome countries see chart if chinese household consumption numbers are on a path to match other similar middle income countries consumption as a  of gdp will likely increase  demonstrated that this trend underway as retail sales expanded  during the year exceeding the country’s total gdp growth of  source world bank  trading economics  the power of china’s shopping is seen in areas as varied as transportation entertainment cell phones and luxury goods today china is the world’s largest automobile market and has charged ahead as the biggest purchaser of electric vehicles moviegoers in china contributed  of total box office receipts in  they also represent one third of global luxury retail sales and they are making many of these purchases online ecommerce purchases grew by  percent last year in china as  of total retail purchases were made online part of this online retail push is attributable to china’s massive market for smartphones which is now the largest in the world conclusion broad market capweighted exposures to the emerging markets can dilute exposures to larger potential growth opportunities to achieve more precise exposures to these opportunities investors could be well suited to either focus on next emerging and frontier markets or more targeted exposures within the bric  st countries global x offers the global x next emerging  frontier etf emfm for broad access to developing markets while excluding the brics south korea and taiwan  in addition global x offers the global x china consumer etf chiq and the global x nasdaq china technology etf qqqc for targeted exposure to segments of the chinese economy that potentially stand to benefit from rising

accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume frontier markets generally have less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries and consequently the risks of investing in foreign securities are
