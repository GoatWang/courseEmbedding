selected collagenase mmp and tyrosinase tyr as gene targets for its selfdelivering platform mmp is a matrix metalloproteinase involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix reduction of mmp may be beneficial in the treatment of skin aging disorders arthritis acne scarring blistering skin disorders corneal erosions endometriosis and possible cancer metastasis tyr is a key enzyme in the synthesis of melanin in addition to its cosmetic program the company is evaluating similar sdrxrna compounds that target mmp and tyr for possible therapeutic developmentophthalmology franchiseas in dermal scarring ctgf is known to play a role in retinal scarring rxi can also be used to target ctgf in the eye where it is known to be involved in retinal scarring building on the work in its dermal clinical program the company has filed a new investigational drug application ind for rxi as a therapeutic for the scarring component of retinal diseases in the eye such as wet agerelated macular degeneration amd it has initiated a phase iii clinical trial to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of rxi in reducing the progression of retinal scarring in advanced neovascular or wetamd its first area of study retinal scarring can result in continued vision loss even if the patient is being treated with an antivascular endothelial growth factor vegf therapy rxi has the potential to fill this unmet medical need by reducing this continuing damage to the retina and in doing so help preserve these patients vision for a longer period of time in addition to the clinical trial for the use of rxi as a therapeutic for retinal scarring it is advancing other earlystage ophthalmology programs the company is involved in a number of collaborations to develop a topical delivery for disorders of the cornea the company also continues its exploratory efforts to identify potential sdrxrna lead compounds and targets from the rnairelated assets acquired from opko health inc opkocosmetic franchiserxis cosmetic development program is based on its sdrxrna technology rxi an sdrxrna compound targeting mmp and rxi an sdrxrna compound targeting tyr are being developed as cosmetic ingredients that may improve skin appearance the companys next steps include plans to complete functional and safety testing for both compounds as well as to develop a method for skin penetration that

pharmaceuticals warts homedermatology warts warts common warts samcyprone™ is being studied for the treatment of cutaneous warts benign epidermal tumors caused by human papillomaviruses hpvs they are extremely common being experienced by most people at some time during their lives although most warts will spontaneously disappear without treatment treatment of these lesions is sought to prevent recurrence there are many different treatment modalities for warts including physical destruction cryotherapy surgical removal carbon dioxide laser chemical destruction salicylic acid glutaraldehyde podophyllin cantharidin bleomycin and immunomodulation interferons retinoids contact immunotherapy however treatment of warts is complicated by low success rates prolonged duration of therapy and the potential for recurrence it is well established that cellmediated immune response plays a major role in controlling hpv infections therefore treatment techniques such as immunotherapy have been used

pharmaceuticalsrxi pharmaceuticals ophthalmology homeophthalmology retinal fibrosis diseases of the eye are well suited to therapeutic intervention using sdrxrna compounds local administration to the eye is an accepted method of administration and generally avoids systemic exposure the use of sdrxrnas may change the landscape of ocular oligonucleotidebased therapeutics enabling rapid discovery and validation of a wide range of novel therapeutic targets and creating the potential for next generation therapeutics for the treatment of serious ocular disorders rxi’s sdrxrna technology is particularly wellsuited this therapeutic area having improved cellular uptake compared to ‘standard’ sirnas and potent silencing activity a clinical trial is ongoing to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of rxi to prevent the progression of retinal scarring a harmful component of numerous retinal diseases read more corneal scarring corneal scarring refers to an injury of the cornea of the eye that causes opacity and visual impairment the effects of corneal scarring can vary from blurring to blindness in the eye diseases of the eye are well suited to therapeutic intervention using sdrxrna compounds  local administration to the eye is an accepted method of administration and generally avoids systemic exposure  rxi’s sdrxrna technology is particularly wellsuited for this therapeutic area having improved cellular uptake compared to ‘standard’ sirnas and potent silencing activity  rxi is involved in a number of collaborations to develop topical delivery for disorders of the cornea read more ophthalmology retinal fibrosis corneal scarring rxi  rxi pharmaceuticalsrxi pharmaceuticals rxi hometechnology rxi rxi rxi rxi pharmaceuticals’ first clinical candidate rxi is a selfdelivering rnai compound sdrxrna being developed to reduce dermal scarring following planned surgeries  rxi is designed to reduce the expression of connective tissue growth factor ctgf a critical regulator of several biological pathways involved in fibrosis including scar formation in the skin  after the successful filing of an ind  single and multiple dose dose escalation phase  clinical trials evaluating rxi in a surgical setting were initiated in  in healthy volunteers rxi and rxi respectively  these two trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rxi and also provided the first evidence of clinical activity in a surgical setting   in early november  we initiated our phase  program with rxi  in the first phase  study rxi subjects with a long hypertrophic scar in the lower abdominal received scar revision surgery and subsequent treatment with rxi over the first month after surgery  subjects received rxi or placebo on a blinded basis at the distal ends of their revised scar leaving a central untreated section of the scar  each subjects’ revised scar area provides the opportunity to compare the appearance of the revised areas after treatment with rxi or placebo or when left untreated allowing for the withinsubject comparison of the three revised scar segments  enrollment and dosing in this trial is complete   in addition a second phase  trial was initiated in  in which subject’s with two similar keloids were enrolled rxi  after the two keloids were surgically removed one keloid was treated with rxi and one was treated with placebo again allowing for the within subject comparison of the treatments  enrollment and dosing in this trial is complete preliminary data from the first phase  hypertrophic scar trial were used to help design a third phase  trial rxi  study  is being conducted in subjects in which one long or two shorter hypertrophic scars are surgically revised  treatment of the revised areas with rxi is being compared directly to revised areas that are left untreated on the same subject  preliminary data from the initial two cohorts of study  demonstrated that scars were less visible after six doses of rxi over the course of three months  based in part on this new information two more cohorts were added to this trial in november   two extended dosing regimens are currently being evaluated to determine if clinical results are improved if dosing is continued further into the extended proliferation phase of wound healing that leads to hypertrophic scarring  lastly rxi is being evaluated in a phase  trial for its safety tolerability and potential activity in the eye  rxi is a dose escalation trial in which subjects with late stage wet agerelated macular degeneration amd with the risk of subretinal fibrosis will be treated with rxi  as in dermal scarring ctgf is known to play a role in retinal scarring  reduction of ctgf in the eye by rxi treatment may reduce the formation of retinal fibrosis that often accompanies late stage amd and contributes to vision loss  the main goals of this study are to establish safety and tolerability of rxi in the eye and to gain a preliminary indication of whether rxi interrupts the scarring process common to these late stage amd subjects  you may find more information on our trials at clinicaltrialsgov  technology rnai about rnai mechanism sdrxrna® rxi
