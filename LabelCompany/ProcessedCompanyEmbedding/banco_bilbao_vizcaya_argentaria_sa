adapting to the changing requirements of an increasingly global market in short to the bank of the st century this vision is backed by one and a half centuries of history the beginnings bbva’s story starts in  when the spanish board of trade sponsored the creation of banco de bilbao as a currencyissuing and discount bank this was a pioneer initiative driven by economic growth in the region until the s it was practically the only bank in that part of spain in  the law passed on december  created banco hipotecario bhe with the aim of granting longterm loans for property in the second half of the th century banco de bilbao played a leading role in operations involving infrastructure projects and development of the steel industry in  it lost the right to issue currency and reorganized as a lending and discount bankbanco de vizcaya was set up in  it carried out its first operations in bilbao and gradually spread throughout the country apart from its activities as a commercial and general purpose bank it intervened in the creation and development of a large part of the spanish industrial sectorin  banco de bilbao merged with banco del comercio although both continued to operate as separate entities in  caja postal was set up as a public entity and started operations in  with the issuing and administration of savings books a consortium of bankers and manufacturers founded banco de crédito industrial bci in  with the express aim of boosting the installation and consolidation of industry through longterm lending both banco de bilbao and banco de vizcaya formed part of this consortium in  the servicio nacional de crédito agrícola was created under the ministry of agriculture to provide loans to agricultural associations against the joint and several liability of their

however in  they were recast as joint stock companies and became official loan entitiesunder the official credit system act during the s banco de bilbao’s strategy was to attain sufficient size in order to participate in financial business generated by advances in technology deregulation securitization and the interrelationship between domestic and international markets banco de vizcaya contributed to the refloating of banks affected by the economic turmoil and pursued a policy of strong growth through acquisitions this turned it into a large banking group the most important

meaning to these relationship moments also known as touchpoints between companies and their customers in this sense the most pioneering institutions have become aware of the importance of the experiences that their services deliver if they generate customer value this will positively impact business results said rob brown bbvas head of marketing design  responsible business brown recalled that the origins of service design can be traced to the public sector in recent years sectors such as finance telecommunications and retail started adopting these practices since then design and the area known as service design have become a key part of building customer relationship models he said bbva is a clear example of the integration of design at a strategic level within the organization where its role has evolved quickly and has resulted in the creation of the first global and multidisciplinary team sdgc has become one of the most important forums of the design sector allowing
