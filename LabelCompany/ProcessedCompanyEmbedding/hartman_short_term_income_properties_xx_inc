hartman xx and its advisor and its affiliates including payments by the reit of significant fees to the advisor and its affiliates some of which are payable based upon factors other than the quality of services provided to us these fees could influence our advisor’s advice to us as well as the judgment of affiliates to our advisor performing service to us economic factors affecting the commercial real estate markets generally including changes in the economy tenant turnover interest rates of mortgage funds operating expenses cost of insurance and each tenant’s ability to continue to pay rent no connection between the share price of the reit and the net asset value of the reit until such time as the assets are valued the board of directors if hartman xx fails to qualify as a reit it will be subject to federal income tax cash available for distributions could decrease materially and adversely affect the return on your investment leverage debt is borrowed money it is often used to supplement or enhance the total return on an investment however it is also recognized that leverage when used excessively can have a significant negative impact on theperformance of an investment

rattle lerner clients not priced reits rattle lerner clients jul     am by bruce kelly clients of david lerner associates inc holding shares in nontraded reits created by apple reit cos inc received account statements at the end of last month in which the longtime value of the shares was shown as “not priced” for years shares of the real estate investment trusts were listed at  on client account statements the firm continued to list the same price after the financial industry regulatory authority inc in  told brokerdealers to adjust prices on the investments more frequently finra also prohibited brokerdealers from using information more than  months old to estimate the value of a nontraded reit at the end of may finra filed a complaint against david lerner alleging that the firm was misleading investors and marketing unsuitable investment products to them finra spokeswoman nancy condon declined to comment on the firms change in account pricing since  david lerner has recommended and sold nearly  billion in apple reit shares according to finra “there have been some questions from investors” about the change of the value of the reits shown on account statements said joseph pickard senior vice president and general counsel with david lerner which is based in syosset ny when asked if investors are anxious about the change he said “i cant answer that” client account statements also show the cost of investment in the apple reits which is either  or  per share mr pickard said there was “no particular reason” for the change but added that the recent “stir and hoopla in other peoples minds” about the reits estimated market value contributed to the firms decision to make the change the firm is “absolutely” in compliance with finra rules and regulations when selling the product mr pickard said the account statement change made by the lerner firm “is causing serious concern for investors” said jake zamansky a plaintiffs attorney who added that his firm zamansky  associates has spoken with up to  david lerner clients “people are really looking for clarity here” a brokerdealer switching a securitys value to “not priced” isnt unheard of but it is far from ordinary attorneys said although some attorneys noted that such a change could be a bad harbinger for any security another lawyer said that such a price change is a potential step in the right direction “the price of  per share is most likely a misrepresentation of its true value which is almost impossible to ascertain and price” said phil aidikoff a plaintiffs attorney who has been following the david lerner case but has no investors with the firm as clients “issues of pricing have been going on for a long time in the securities business” mr aidikoff said having nontraded reits listed as “not priced” on client account statements is not “systemic” said kevin hogan executive director of the investment program association a trade group that includes nontraded reits and the brokerdealers that sell them he added that he had “no idea” whether any other reits have recently made such a change on client account statements finras complaint against david lerner has renewed concerns among brokerdealers about the sales of illiquid investments such as nontraded reits and private placements problem funds a few small nontraded reits recently have made disclosures revealing problems or at least the potential for problems with investments brokerdealer executives said in addition to problems with investments some smaller reits may be having a hard time gaining traction with brokerdealers because firms are looking to product sponsors to educate advisers and their clients said nicholas schorsch ceo of america realty capital which sponsors five nontraded reits before the credit crisis in  nontraded reits could be successful simply by showing up he said with anxiety running high among investors and brokerdealer executives due to problems with some of the products and the market in general that way of doing business has changed mr schorsch said “the market is getting more difficult just because you get to the table doesnt mean you get to play” he said the number of nontradedreit products has exploded since  practically quadrupling to  noted jeffrey hanson ceo of grubb  ellis equity advisors llc “theres saturation with all the new entrants and barriers are very real and high” he said new nontraded reits need to raise  million to  million a month to work and many simply cant reach that level “if you cant get to  million youre going to have further shutdowns” he said problems at smaller nontraded reits — those that have raised less than  million — have caught the attention of the sec and finra which are scrutinizing the popular products sold exclusively through independent brokerdealers around the same time that finra filed its complaint against david lerner several nontraded reits reported real or potential difficulties for example desert capital real estate investment trust inc in april filed for bankruptcy protection and at the end of may todd parriott its chief executive resigned also in april a member of the board and chairman of the compensation committee resigned from hartman short term income properties xx inc a nontraded reit after the resignation of the director larry bouffard the companys board authorized the reit to consider buying pieces of a related reit hartman short term income properties xix inc meanwhile this month bluerock enhanced multifamily trust inc which last year pulled its reit from the market said that an affiliated brokerdealer bluerock capital markets llc will assume the managing and distribution for its initial public offering sudden changes in a reits board or the brokerdealer that sells the product or the purchasing of properties by one reit from another related reit are indicators that brokerdealers and registered representatives need to pay careful attention to the investment industry observers said “when we see something like this it raises eyebrows and well look into it further” said jeff young senior vice president with first financial equity corp a brokerdealer with  affiliated reps problems with nontraded reits often occur off the radar he said the firm has selling agreements with both the hartman xix and hartman xx reits but passed on selling agreements with the desert capital and bluerock reits “hartman is a good company and the properties are good properties” mr young said but first financial equity has become “very restrictive” with its selling agreements for investments such as nontraded reits and private placements mr young said that the nontradedreit industry does have potential conflicts of interest particularly if a sponsor of the reits has more than one program first financial equity has become more restrictive with the products that it sells just as the industry continues to mushroom he said “i dont have time to talk to all the reit wholesalers that are knocking on our door” mr young said executives from the three nontradedreit sponsors stressed that the changes were due to market conditions or a normal part of the business finra hasnt filed actions against brokerdealers related to the sale of those three sponsors reits desert capital reit spokeswoman carrie cook attributed her firms bankruptcy filing to the effect the credit crisis had on real estate in las vegas and elsewhere in nevada allen hartman said that the changes revealed in april sec filings by his firm — which owns about  million in real estate mostly in texas — were a normal part of doing business and were unrelated he said that he asked mr bouffard  to resign from the board due to his age the two reits bought properties together and the hartman xx reit is buying up the assets of hartman xix based on pricing done by an independent third party and approved by the independent board r ramin kamfar owner and chief executive of
