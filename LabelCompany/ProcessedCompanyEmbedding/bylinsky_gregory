believe the highest potential return to shareholders is from a return of capital to shareholders as we monetize assets rather than reinvest the proceeds we intend to return the capital derived therefrom less any working capital requirements back to shareholders through a stock repurchase program or by other means such as special dividends taking into effect liquidity requirements debt
