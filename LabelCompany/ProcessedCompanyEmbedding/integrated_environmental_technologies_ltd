integrated environmental technologies ltd nov    et share this article little river sc nov   prnewswire  integrated environmental technologies ltd otc qb ievm iet or the company a specialty chemical supplier providing epaapproved costeffective environmentally friendly cleaning and disinfecting solutions primarily to the oil and gas industry with additional opportunities in healthcare and food production today reported financial results for the three and nine month periods ended september   key third quarter and nine months  highlights third quarter and nine month revenue was  and  respectively a reduction from the previous year periods as the company slowly regains momentum following the adverse impact from the precipitous drop in oil prices from october  through january  that caused oil drillers to scale down operations gross margin for the third quarter and the ninemonth period was approximately  and  respectively roughly consistent with prior quarters despite modest revenue and startup costs related to an additional th production facility opened during the third quarter the company reduced monthly cash used in operating activities by approximately  to  during the first nine months of  compared to the same period in  a  decrease during the third quarter of  the loss from operations adjusted for noncash expenses averaged approximately  per month down from approximately  per month during the same period of the previous year operating expenses totaled approximately  in the third quarter of  a  decrease over the third quarter of  and a  decrease over the second quarter of  in july  the company raised gross proceeds totaling  through the issuance of zero coupon secured convertible debentures with a face value of  to support business development initiatives and working capital early third quarter we received verbal confirmation of business expansion opportunities with several existing customers signed master service agreements with  large independent oil and gas producers furthered discussions with several additional producers to sign similar engagements and initiated sales through two regional distributors  in light of those developments we anticipated that revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters coupled with the funds raised in july would carry the company to breakeven in december  unfortunately our estimates were not correct  while iet does not appear to have lost any of the opportunities that led to the estimates the timing was off   during the third quarter  we serviced a total of  wells on the excelyte® maintenance program – significantly less than were anticipated  although we have now begun servicing additional wells in our pipeline we are approximately  to  months behind expectations and the timeline to breakeven is similarly delayed  consequently we are responding to the revised timeline by making adjustments for the endurance of the company commented david lavance president chief executive officer and chairman of the board of iet mr lavance continued iet produces a uniquely effective highly costefficient product that addresses several very large multibillion dollar industries  now that the company has persevered through a difficult market scrutinized its costs and is in a revenue rebuilding phase the company needs industryfocused leadership to expedite this growth cycle  to allow for this new leadership i have tendered my resignation as president and chief executive officer of iet effective november    i believe that iet is positioned to achieve the level of success for which its stockholders have patiently waited  we have worked hard to create products that are vital to the industries they serve developed a business model that can generate recurring high margin revenue and secured master service agreements with three large oil and gas producers  this is a foundation on which new leadership can build  mr lavance concluded i thank the investors for their support over the last several years as the company has transformed from an early stage development company into a commercialized business  i will continue on as chairman of the board and will be working in concert with my fellow board members to review our alternatives for the next generation of executive management and to evaluate strategic alternatives iet reported revenue for the third quarter of  of approximately  compared to  for the same period of the previous year and  in the second quarter of   the yearoveryear decrease in revenue was primarily the result of an  decrease in sales to two oil and gas customers who either reduced their well maintenance budgets andor closed down lowproducing wells at the end of  in response to the collapse in oil prices  this was offset by a  increase in sales to an existing customer that expanded its use of excelyte® well maintenance treatments to wells in two additional basins  the quarteroverquarter revenue decline is due to a higher percentage of new wells initiated in the second quarter than in the third quarter  generally a new well is treated every week for the first month and then once a month thereafter as it enters the maintenance cycle  in january  as oil prices fell to a low of barrel europe brent spot price fob iet went from treating  wells at year end  to treating just  wells in january  delivering approximately  gallons of excelyte® during that month  at the end of the second quarter of  iet business rebounded to  wells under treatment delivering a total of  gallons during the quarter  on september   those figures increased to  wells delivering  gallons of excelyte® lower than the  wells the company had projected to treat by the end of august  which was based upon roll out schedules from its customers  the opportunity to treat those new wells remains however the timing has been significantly delayed due to various internal customer issues including customer equipment problems irregularities in newly drilled wells and industry consolidation interruptions  accordingly assuming that we can secure additional capital to fund operations iet currently estimates that it will have  wells under treatment by yearend  the company reported a net loss of approximately  less than  per basic share for the third quarter of   this compares to a net loss of approximately  for the third quarter of  and a net loss of approximately  for the second quarter of   iet incurred a loss from operations of approximately  for the third quarter of  compared to a loss from operations of approximately  in the same period of  and  in the second quarter of  iets gross profit on revenue in the third quarter of  was approximately  yielding a gross margin of  during which the company incurred startup costs totaling approximately  for its operations at a new satellite facility in sonora texas  this area in the southeast permian basin is located close to a distributor to which iet has begun to sell product in order to serve additional smaller oil and gas operators that are not a direct focus for iet  it is estimated that this satellite production facility could achieve breakeven operating results at  wells approximately  gallons of fluid sold monthly under the excelyte® maintenance program this compares to a gross profit of approximately  and gross margin of  for the third quarter of  and gross profit of approximately  and a gross margin of  for the second quarter of   iet targets gross margin in excess of  as it achieves optimal production levels at its five facilities operating expenses for the third quarter of  totaled approximately  a decrease of approximately   over the same period of  and a decrease of approximately   compared to the second quarter of   the substantial reduction in yearoveryear operating expenses was primarily attributed to a  decrease in sales and marketing expenses due to a  decrease in employee payroll  benefits and a  decrease in travel offset by a  increase in rent expense and maintenance expenses related to additional facilities and a  decrease in general and administrative expenses as the company reduced its costs with a  decrease in employee payroll and benefits a  decrease in investor and public relations a  reduction in travel and conference expenses as well as general officerelated expenses  the  quarteroverquarter operating expenses continued to decrease across all key areas most notably sales and management compensation were shifted towards an incentive basis that includes profitability growth targets  subsequent to the end of the third quarter of  iet further reduced costs by approximately  per month through an overhauling of the sales team interest expense for the third quarter of  totaled approximately  compared to approximately  incurred in the same period of  and approximately  incurred in the second quarter of   the yearoveryear increase of  in interest expense  of which was accreted interest was due in part to the issuance of  twoyear convertible debentures with a face value of approximately  in november and december   in addition affecting both the yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter comparisons in july  the company issued  oneyear secured convertible debentures zero coupon convertible at  per share with a face amount of  in connection with the issuance of these debentures the company issued warrants to purchase approximately  million shares of its common stock at  per share consistent with the pricing of the convertible debentures for the nine months ended september   the company reported revenue of

two additional basins  the companys gross margin for the nine months ended september   was  compared to  for the prior nine month period  the slight reduction in gross margin was due to the lower levels of revenue and the startup costs associated with two new production facilities during the first and third quarters of  the company reduced its selling general and administrative sga expenses by approximately  or  to  million during the ninemonths ended september   compared to the same period in   the decrease in expenses is primarily the result of a reduction in employee payroll benefits and directors compensation including stockbased compensation by approximately  a decrease in public relations and stockholder related expenses by approximately  and a reduction in office corporate travel and conference expenses by approximately   these expense reductions were partially offset by an increase in rent and maintenance expenses of approximately  related to the opening of additional facilities  during the ninemonths ended september   the companys research and development expenses decreased by approximately  to  primarily due to an approximately  decrease in stockbased compensation expense for employees and an approximately  decrease in laboratory testing fees  interest expense during the first nine months of  increased by  to approximately  of which accreted
