you ever ask to review yourself the financial plan prepared by  studios petros asked no verrecchia replied petros why not verrecchia i was relying upon the staff of edc it would have taken me an awful lot of time and energy that i didnt have to go in and review their financial plan further verrecchias deposition reveals that he and one other edc board member  stephen lane then ceo of medicaldevice company ximedica  were emailed by an edc administrative assistant that keith stokes wanted them to know about a meeting on april   with thengovernor carcieri curt schilling mike corso keith stokes and j michael saul asked why he he was invited to meet with schilling by the governor verrecchia said he could not recall why he insisted he did not attend that meeting a later email between verrechia and lane that was discussed during the deposition indicated lane attended what was referred to as “the curt schilling ‘pitch’” meeting “i was not at the ‘pitch’ meeting” verrecchia said “i don’t know what went on at the ‘pitch’ meeting he lane was there he’s asking me if i had been appraised of the ask and i said i have not appraised so i have no idea what went on at the curt schilling ‘pitch’ meeting

verrecchia about his agreeing to introduce edc staff to mark blecher at hasbro as part of the “ studios’ due diligence” verrecchia said blecher worked for hasbro and was responsible for videogame activities primarily licensing agreements with video game distributors licensed intellectual property” it appeared from documents that the meeting between saul and blecher took place april   verrecchia confirmed a later email about that meeting indicated another hasbro employee attended – james jones whom verrecchia said he did not know verrecchia insisted he and lane were not working with edc staff on the  studios transaction before the full board knew about the transaction from his work at hasbro the worlds secondlargest toy company with approximate revenue of  billion when he retired as ceo in  verrecchia said in his deposition that he was familiar with the videogame industry knew that delays with game releases were common and says he spoke to the edc board about the risks and insisted the loan should not close unless the edc retained a thirdparty monitor that would evaluate  studios with a goal of keeping the company on track to make the game verrecchia said he didnt learn that a thirdparty monitoring agreement never was reached until long after the fact verrecchia noted on more than one occasion in his deposition that stokes talked about thenspeaker fox’s interest in the  studios transaction “all keith stokes said was that the legislature had passed this job creation bill and that the 7 million was earmarked at that time for  studios and he indicated that the speaker will be unhappy if we were to take that 7 million and give it to somebody else” verrecchia said in late  carcieri had selected verrecchia to lead a review of the edc in  verrecchia authored a scathing report blasting rhode islands economicdevelopment efforts and the state agency charged with creating and retaining jobs calling the agency fragmented disjointed and without focus  in announcing those findings verrecchia compared the edc to a basket of frogs and said the agencys director should be replaced with a professional economic development executive and board members should be qualified and able to establish strategy ensure accountability and drive performance by january  carcieri appointed a new board with verrecchia as vice chairman after a national search for a new edc director failed to produce results a month earlier ioanna t morfessis hired as that new chief abruptly resigned before she was set to take over  the states lawyer max wistow represented

with edc staff on the  studios transaction before the full board knew about the transaction from his work at hasbro the worlds secondlargest toy company with approximate revenue of  billion when he retired as ceo in  verrecchia said in his deposition that he was familiar with the videogame industry knew that delays with game releases were common and says he spoke to the edc board about the risks and insisted the loan should not close unless the edc retained a thirdparty monitor that would evaluate  studios with a goal of keeping the company on track to make the game verrecchia said he didnt learn that a thirdparty monitoring agreement never was reached until long after the fact verrecchia noted on more than one occasion in his deposition that stokes talked about thenspeaker fox’s interest in the  studios transaction “all keith stokes said was that the legislature had passed this job creation bill and that the 7 million was earmarked at that time for  studios and he indicated that the speaker will be unhappy if we were to take that 7 million and give it to somebody else” verrecchia said in late  carcieri had selected verrecchia to lead a review of the edc in  verrecchia authored a scathing report blasting rhode islands economicdevelopment efforts and the state agency charged with creating and retaining jobs calling the agency fragmented disjointed and without focus  in announcing those findings verrecchia compared the edc to a basket of frogs and said the agencys director should be replaced with a professional economic development executive and board members should be qualified and able to establish strategy ensure accountability and drive performance by january  carcieri appointed a new board with verrecchia as vice chairman after a national search for a new edc director failed to produce results a month earlier ioanna t morfessis hired as that new chief abruptly resigned before she was set to take over  the states lawyer max wistow represented verrechia at the deposition but said there would be no fee – wistow said he was not getting paid “except on the contingency basis that everybody knows about” subscribe today choose the plan that’s
