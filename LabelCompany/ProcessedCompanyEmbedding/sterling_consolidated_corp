will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling security holders all of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock will go to the selling security holders we have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security holders rubber is the raw material that we are dependent on in our business in order to compete in the us a supplier must import from china this is due to the fact that manufacturing rubber is a labor intensive project and labor costs are significantly cheaper in china than they are in the united states there is a lot of competition in the us for seals and products that we distribute in order to establish competitive prices we purchase large quantities of product at a time it would be too costly for smaller companies or our customers to circumvent us by buying directly from the supplier because the prices are much higher for smaller orders importation costs are also high and add to the overall cost of the product this is a competitive advantage for us because we are a larger company that has the cash and other resources that enables us to hold inventory at our warehouse this helps us maintain a competitive advantage because not only do we have the ability of reducing our costs we can also decrease the amount of time it takes to deliver orders to our customers provided that we have the product in our warehouse stockpiling an inventory also requires capital currently we have over two million dollars in inventory to service our current customers’ demands for some of our customers there is a cost incurred as a result of switching from sterling seal as a supplier because sterling seal is an approved supplier for many of our industrial and commercial customers while other suppliers may not be approved our customers could face increased costs as a result of switching to another suppliers product for certain customers in order to switch from an approved supplier the product must be tested and approved in the automotive industry the factories have to be audited and approved in addition to the distributor and their products because of the potential for increasing costs our current customers are unlikely to abandon us in addition many of our customers place small orders throughout the year it takes a long time to build the business to cover overhead costs for this reason it is difficult for a supplier to enter into our industry most of sterling seal’s accounts are repeat customers with consistent demands for orings and custommolded rubber once we have the product in our warehouse either if it is already in inventory or if we just received the shipment of the product from china the company is able to costeffectively distribute products to local markets across the united states within two  business days because we have established multiple distribution factories over the course of our years of operating this helps to expedite deliveries and reduce costs this also gives us an advantage over our competitors in addition the vertical integration of our freight forwarding business integrity with our primary operations through sterling seal helps us deliver products more costeffectively we currently have relationships with domestic and international distributors the company intends to increase sales through acquisitions and investing in complementary corporations company description we were incorporated in the state of nevada as oceanview acquisition corp on january   on may   we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to sterling consolidated corp we are a holding company and all of our operations are conducted through our four subsidiaries sterling seal  supply inc “sterling seal” addr properties llc “addr” q ventures llc “q” and integrity cargo freight corporation “integrity” in june  these four entities became subsidiaries of the company through an equity exchange agreement by which the shareholders of sterling seal addr q and integrity became shareholders of the company and in exchange the company received all of the authorized and outstanding shares of sterling seal addr q and integrity sterling consolidated corp conducts its entire business through its four subsidiaries each subsidiary is responsible for a specific business function of the company  our largest subsidiary is sterling seal  supply inc “sterling seal” a new jersey corporation which was incorporated in  its predecessor was sterling plastic  rubber products inc incorporated in new jersey founded in  sterling seal engages primarily in the distribution and sale of orings rubber seals oil seals custom molded rubber parts custom teflon parts teflon rods oring cord bonded seals oring kits and stuffing box sealant sterling seal is a distributor of orings orings are one of the simplest yet most engineered precise and useful seal designs they are one of the most common and important elements of machine design orings and the other products that sterling seal sells are used in a wide variety of industries including automotive pump transmissions oil and energy machinery and packaging these products are utilized primarily as seals to prevent leakage of liquids or air most of the products carried by sterling seal are made of rubber but some are coated and the rubber compound can change upon customer request sterling seal sells directly to smaller distributors and original equipment manufacturers in need of seals it offers a catalogue of standard sizes and will take orders for special sizes not available in the standard catalogue in order to satisfy the needs of our customers and stay competitive sterling seal always maintains a wide variety of products in substantial quantities at its main warehouse in neptune new jersey as well as its other facilities in the united states the products that we hold in inventory at our warehouse are standard products that are most often ordered if a customer orders a product that is not in our inventory we will have to order the product from one of our suppliers in china we have approximately  customers that place orders with us for the delivery of oring or similar products our largest customer is freudenberg who sells replacements kits to john deer and harley davidson among many other companies other automotive customers are precision international and sonnax transmissions we stock a variety of rubber seals to service pool filter and pump manufacturers we also distribute our products to many resellers of replacement parts and pool stores bay state pool and horizon pool and spa are two of our larger accounts in the pool industry a large portion of our customer base services the plumbing and industrial industries these accounts include fastenal kaman industrial and eastern industrial they are localized to service a wide range of products but they purchase orings and rubber seals from sterling sterling seal receives requests for quotations electronically and by fax daily from its various customers the sales force then reviews each request and responds with a “quoted” price for delivery and price if such a quote is accepted the customer responds with a purchase order for a specific price and delivery after a purchase order is accepted and we do not have the ordered product in our inventory we then contact one of our fifteen different suppliers all of our suppliers are located in china in determining which suppliers to use we look for suppliers that deliver quality products in a timely manner we do not have any long term contracts with any of our suppliers the following is the list of our  largest principal suppliers  progum elastomer technology co ltd  ivy seals group corp  ge mao rubber ind co  escort seals  rubber best industry corp  wyatt seal inc  best ring industrial  supaseal ltd  goodway rubber ind co ltd  anyseals inc oring and rubber seals are generally considered commodities meaning that such goods are fungible and there is little if any distinction between the various producers and suppliers of the products none of the products sold by sterling seal are under patent and there are no intellectual property or licensing issues sterling seal sets itself apart from other similarly situated companies though the variety and quality of its inventory the price point at which it sells its various products and its ability to deliver products to customers on time the time it takes us to deliver the ordered product to a customer will mainly depend on whether we have it in inventory or need to order it from a supplier in china if we have it in inventory we can package ship and distribute the product within two  business days when orders arrive at sterling seal we ship the products to our customer and invoice on a day basis integrity cargo freight corporation our subsidiary integrity cargo freight corporation “integrity” is a freight forwarding business they are primarily responsible for transporting products we order from our suppliers back to our warehouse in neptune nj after sterling seal confirms from its supplier that a product is ready to be picked up integrity cargo is responsible for picking up the products and getting them to the dock and delivered to the sterling seal warehouse integrity shares a facility with sterling seal and manages the importation of sterling seal’s products and its exports to various countries currently eighty percent  of sterling seal’s imports come from asia and ten percent  of the company’s sales are exported to various countries however all payables are billed and collected in usd so sterling does not bear any foreign exchange risk on open payables we incorporated integrity in order to vertically integrate our operations and not have to rely on third parties to deliver our products from the supplier this has resulted in quicker delivery and more predictable delivery times this provides the company with a competitive advantage over other importers of orings and seals as we can utilize our own freight company and consolidate our operations as a result the company is able to provide lower prices to its customers this also provides us with a much greater level of control over our shipping which expedites lead times and deliveries to our customers entering the freight forwarding market has provided the company with a competitive advantage as compared with other importing distributors of rubber orings by having the ability to utilize our own freight company we are able to consolidate shipments from various sources and ship as frequently as needed which has resulted in improved efficiencies and delivery times integrity also performs freight forwarding services for third party customers integrity currently has about twenty  customers that it performs freight forwarding services for however roughly fifty percent  of its revenues derive from freight forwarding for sterling seal integrity shares a facility and certain overhead costs such as information technology with sterling seal so both entities have lower operational costs due to economies of scale addr properties llc
