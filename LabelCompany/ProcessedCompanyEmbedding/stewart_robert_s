kristen stewart calls relationship with robert pattinson a “product”  vanity fairvanity fairsign inproduct placementkristen stewart calls relationship with robert pattinson a “product”the actress tells t magazine that it was “gross” to have her relationship with her former boyfriend turned into a commodityby hilary weaveraugust  6 6 pmemailfacebooktwitterby julian makeyrexshutterstockthis summer the public has gotten better acquainted with kristen stewart —namely her personal life the yearold actress has been very up front about the fact that she’s found love with visualeffects producer alicia cargile it’s been a while since we’ve heard much about her past with twilight costar robert pattinson with whom she broke up in  but during in a new interview with t magazine stewart brought up her time with pattinson—and the highly capitalized commodity that was their relationship“people wanted me and rob to be together so badly that our relationship was made into a product” she told the magazine “it wasn’t real life anymore”she went on to say that that the media attention was “gross” to her ”i don’t want to become a part of a story for entertainment value” stewart added the couple dealt with an extreme amount of attention particularly when stewart’s cheating on pattinson—and subsequent public apology—became a closely watched news item httpwwwusmagazinecomcelebritynewsnewskristenstewartscheatingscandalatimelineofevents7the experience made stewart closely guarded when it comes to revealing details about herself nevertheless the stewart who spoke to t was much more open than the one the public saw while she was with pattinson “i would never talk about any of my relationships before but once i started dating girls it seemed like there was an opportunity to represent something really positive” stewart explained about her new perspective on discussing private mattersshe scrolls through her private instagram account in front of the interviewer pointing out pictures of herself with cargile the couple exists mostly out of the spotlight the complete opposite of “robsten” kristen stewart is no longer onehalf of a product being peddled by the media and she’s much happier “i’m not sad anymore i’m not saturated anymore i’ve been dropped back into everyone else’s reality and now i can live again’do you have what
