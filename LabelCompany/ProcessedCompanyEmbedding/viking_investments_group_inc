accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared and actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions on a regular basis we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our financial statements as well as the sufficiency of the disclosures pertaining to our accounting policies in the footnotes accompanying our financial statements described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements some of which are subject to alternative treatments under gaap we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies see note   summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements oil and gas property accounting the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and natural gas properties under this method of accounting all costs of acquisition exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties including such costs as leasehold acquisition costs geological expenditures dry hole costs tangible and intangible development costs and direct internal costs are capitalized as the cost of oil and natural gas properties when incurred the full cost method requires the company to calculate quarterly by cost center a ceiling or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet to the extent capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceed the sum of the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties subject to amortization the cost of properties not being amortized and the related tax amounts such excess capitalized costs are charged to expense proved reserves estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with us sec guidelines for reporting corporate reserves and future net revenue the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of i the quality and quantity of available data ii the interpretation of that data iii the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and iv the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate table of contents our proved reserve information included in this report was predominately based on estimates because these estimates depend on many assumptions all of which may substantially differ from future actual results reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered in addition results of drilling testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate in accordance with sec requirements we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on the unweighted arithmetic average of the prior month commodity prices as of the first day of each of the months constituting the period and costs on the date of the estimate the estimates of proved reserves materially impact depreciation depletion amortization and accretion dda expense if the estimates of proved reserves decline the rate at which we record dda expense will increase reducing future net income such a decline may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce from highercost fields asset retirement obligation asset retirement obligations aro primarily represent the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug abandon and remediate our producing properties at the projected end of their productive lives in accordance with applicable federal state and local laws we determined our aro by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the obligation the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the obligations inception with an offsetting increase to proved properties periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as accretion expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income aro liability is determined using significant assumptions including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs annual inflation of these costs the productive lives of wells and a riskadjusted interest rate changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated aro revenues from oil and gas properties are recognized under the entitlements method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized on the amount the company is entitled to based on its
