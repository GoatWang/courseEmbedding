laude bachelor of arts in humanities with a major in american literature and philosophy marshall wanted to study in his hometown law school the university of maryland school of law but did not apply

graduate with excellent credentials who was denied admission to the university of maryland law school because of its segregation policy black students in maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments morgan college the princess anne academy or outofstate black institutions using the strategy developed by nathan margold marshall argued that marylands segregation policy violated the separate but equal doctrine of plessy v ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a staterun black institution the maryland court of appeals ruled against the state of maryland and its attorney general who represented the university of maryland stating compliance with the constitution cannot be deferred at the will of the state whatever system

florida  us   that same year he founded and became the executive director of the naacp legal defense and educational fund as the head of the legal defense fund he argued many other civil rights cases before the supreme court most of them successfully including smith v allwright  us   shelley v kraemer  us   sweatt v painter  us   and mclaurin v oklahoma state regents  us   his most famous case as a lawyer was brown v board of education of topeka  us   the case in which the supreme court ruled that separate but equal public education as established by plessy v ferguson was not applicable to public education because it could never be truly equal in total marshall won  out of the  cases he argued before the supreme court during the s thurgood marshall developed a friendly relationship with j edgar hoover the director of the federal bureau of investigation in  for example he privately praised hoovers campaign to discredit trm howard a maverick civil rights leader from mississippi during a national speaking tour howard criticized the fbis failure to seriously investigate cases such as the  killers of george w lee and emmett till in a private letter to hoover marshall attacked howard as a rugged individualist who did not speak for the naacp two years earlier howard arranged for marshall to deliver a wellreceived speech at a rally of his regional council of negro leadership in mound bayou mississippi only days before the brown decision according to historians david t beito and linda royster beito marshalls disdain for howard was almost visceral he disliked howards militant tone and maverick stance and was well aware that hoovers attack served to take the heat off the naacp and provided opportunities for closer collaboration between the naacp and the fbi in civil rights court of appeals and solicitor general president john f kennedy appointed marshall to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in  to a new seat created on may   by  stat  a group of senators from the south led by mississippis james eastland held up his confirmation so he served for the first several months under a recess appointment marshall remained on that court until  when

and the first african american marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this you do what you think is right and let the law catch up a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism marshall served on the court for the next  years compiling a liberal record that included strong support for constitutional protection of individual rights especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government his most frequent ally on the court the pair rarely voted at odds was justice william brennan who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty brennan and marshall concluded in furman v georgia that the death penalty was in all circumstances unconstitutional and never accepted the legitimacy of gregg v georgia which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances thereafter brennan or marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of deathcitation needed in  marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the constitution of the united states marshall stated the government they devised was defective from the start requiring several amendments a civil war and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights we hold as fundamental today in conclusion marshall stated some may more quietly commemorate the suffering struggle and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled i plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the constitution as a living document including the bill of rights and the other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law as well in teamsters v terry he held that the seventh amendment entitled the plaintiff to a jury

permitting a savings and loan association to deduct a loss from an exchange of mortgage participation interests in personnel administrator ma v feeney marshall wrote a dissent saying that a law that

policy black students in maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments morgan college the princess anne academy or outofstate black institutions using the strategy developed by nathan margold marshall argued that marylands segregation policy violated the separate but equal doctrine of plessy v ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a staterun black institution the maryland court of appeals ruled against the state of maryland and its attorney general who represented the university of maryland stating compliance with the

discredit trm howard a maverick civil rights leader from mississippi during a national speaking tour howard criticized the fbis failure to seriously investigate cases such as the  killers of george w lee and emmett till in a private letter to hoover marshall attacked howard as a rugged individualist who did not speak for the naacp two years earlier howard arranged for marshall to deliver a wellreceived speech at a rally of his regional council of negro leadership in mound bayou mississippi only days before the brown decision according to historians david t beito and linda royster beito marshalls disdain for howard was almost visceral he disliked howards militant tone and maverick stance and was well aware that hoovers attack served to take the heat off the naacp and provided opportunities for closer collaboration between the naacp and the fbi in civil rights court of appeals and solicitor general president john f kennedy appointed marshall to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in  to a new seat created on may   by  stat  a group of senators from the south led by mississippis james eastland held up his confirmation so he served for the first

associate justice by a senate vote of – on august   he was the th person to hold the position and the first african american marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this you do what you think is right and let the law catch up a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism marshall served on the court for the next  years compiling a liberal record that included strong support for constitutional protection of individual rights especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government his most frequent ally on the court the pair rarely voted at odds was justice william brennan who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty brennan and marshall concluded in furman v georgia that the death penalty was in all circumstances unconstitutional and never accepted the legitimacy of gregg v georgia which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances thereafter brennan or marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of deathcitation needed in  marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the constitution of the united states marshall stated the government they devised was defective from the start requiring several amendments a civil war and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights we hold as fundamental today in conclusion marshall stated some may more quietly commemorate the suffering struggle and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document and observe the anniversary

individual freedoms and human rights although best remembered for jurisprudence in the fields of civil rights and criminal procedure marshall made significant contributions to other areas of the law

j edgar hoover the director of the federal bureau of investigation in  for example he privately praised hoovers campaign to discredit trm howard a maverick civil rights leader from mississippi during a national speaking tour howard criticized the fbis failure to seriously investigate cases such as the  killers of george w lee and emmett till in a private letter to hoover marshall attacked howard as a rugged individualist who did not speak for the naacp two years earlier howard arranged for marshall to deliver a wellreceived speech at a rally of his regional council of negro leadership in mound bayou mississippi only days before the brown decision according to historians david t beito and linda royster beito marshalls disdain for howard was almost visceral he disliked howards militant tone and maverick stance and was well aware that hoovers attack served to take the heat off the naacp and provided opportunities for closer collaboration between the naacp and the fbi in civil rights

and the first african american marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this you do what you think is right and let the law catch up a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism marshall served on the court for the next  years compiling a liberal record that included strong support for constitutional protection of individual rights especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government his most frequent ally on the court the pair rarely voted at odds was justice william brennan who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty brennan and marshall concluded in furman v georgia that the death penalty was in all circumstances unconstitutional and never accepted the legitimacy of gregg v georgia which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances thereafter brennan or marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of deathcitation needed in  marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the constitution of the united states marshall stated the government they devised was defective from the start requiring several amendments a civil war and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights we hold as fundamental today in conclusion marshall stated some may more quietly commemorate the suffering struggle and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled i plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the

policy black students in maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments morgan college the princess anne academy or outofstate black institutions using the strategy developed by nathan margold marshall argued that marylands segregation policy violated the separate but equal doctrine of plessy v ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a staterun black institution the maryland court of appeals ruled against the state of maryland and its attorney general who represented the university of maryland stating compliance with the

discredit trm howard a maverick civil rights leader from mississippi during a national speaking tour howard criticized the fbis failure to seriously investigate cases such as the  killers of george w lee and emmett till in a private letter to hoover marshall attacked howard as a rugged individualist who did not speak for the naacp two years earlier howard arranged for marshall to deliver a wellreceived speech at a rally of his regional council of negro leadership in mound bayou mississippi only days before the brown decision according to historians david t beito and linda royster beito marshalls disdain for howard was almost visceral he disliked howards militant tone and maverick stance and was well aware that hoovers attack served to take the heat off the naacp and provided opportunities for closer collaboration between the naacp and the fbi in civil rights court of appeals and solicitor general president john f kennedy appointed marshall to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in  to a new seat created on may   by  stat  a group of senators from the south led by mississippis james eastland held up his confirmation so he served for the first

you think is right and let the law catch up a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism marshall served on the court for the next  years compiling a liberal record that included strong support for constitutional protection of individual rights especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government his most frequent ally on the court the pair rarely voted at odds was justice william brennan who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty brennan and marshall concluded in furman v georgia that the death penalty was in all circumstances unconstitutional and never accepted the legitimacy of gregg v georgia which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances thereafter brennan or marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of deathcitation needed in  marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the constitution of the united states marshall stated the government they devised was defective from the start requiring several amendments a civil war and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights we hold as fundamental today in

j edgar hoover the director of the federal bureau of investigation in  for example he privately praised hoovers campaign to discredit trm howard a maverick civil rights leader from mississippi during a national speaking tour howard criticized the fbis failure to seriously investigate cases such as the  killers of george w lee and emmett till in a private letter to hoover marshall attacked howard as a rugged individualist who did not speak for the naacp two years earlier howard arranged for marshall to deliver a wellreceived speech at a rally of his regional council of negro leadership in mound bayou mississippi only days before the brown decision according to historians david t beito and linda royster beito marshalls disdain for howard was almost visceral he disliked howards militant tone and maverick stance and was well aware that hoovers attack served to take the heat off the naacp and provided opportunities for closer collaboration between the naacp and the fbi in civil rights

and the first african american marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this you do what you think is right and let the law catch up a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism marshall served on the court for the next  years compiling a liberal record that included strong support for constitutional protection of individual rights especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government his most frequent ally on the court the pair rarely voted at odds was justice william brennan who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty brennan and marshall concluded in furman v georgia that the death penalty was in all circumstances unconstitutional and never accepted the legitimacy of gregg v georgia which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances thereafter brennan or marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of deathcitation needed in  marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the constitution of the united states marshall stated the government they devised was defective from the start requiring several amendments a civil war and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights we hold as fundamental today in conclusion marshall stated some may more quietly commemorate the suffering struggle and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document and observe the anniversary with hopes not realized and promises not fulfilled i plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the

policy black students in maryland wanting to study law had to attend segregated establishments morgan college the princess anne academy or outofstate black institutions using the strategy developed by nathan margold marshall argued that marylands segregation policy violated the separate but equal doctrine of plessy v ferguson because the state did not provide a comparable educational opportunity at a staterun black institution the maryland court of appeals ruled against the state of maryland and its attorney general who represented the university of maryland stating compliance with the

discredit trm howard a maverick civil rights leader from mississippi during a national speaking tour howard criticized the fbis failure to seriously investigate cases such as the  killers of george w lee and emmett till in a private letter to hoover marshall attacked howard as a rugged individualist who did not speak for the naacp two years earlier howard arranged for marshall to deliver a wellreceived speech at a rally of his regional council of negro leadership in mound bayou mississippi only days before the brown decision according to historians david t beito and linda royster beito marshalls disdain for howard was almost visceral he disliked howards militant tone and maverick stance and was well aware that hoovers attack served to take the heat off the naacp and provided opportunities for closer collaboration between the naacp and the fbi in civil rights court of appeals and solicitor general president john f kennedy appointed marshall to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in  to a new seat created on may   by  stat  a group of senators from the south led by mississippis james eastland held up his confirmation so he served for the first

associate justice by a senate vote of – on august   he was the th person to hold the position and the first african american marshall once bluntly described his legal philosophy as this you do what you think is right and let the law catch up a statement which his conservative detractors argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism marshall served on the court for the next  years compiling a liberal record that included strong support for constitutional protection of individual rights especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government his most frequent ally on the court the pair rarely voted at odds was justice william brennan who consistently joined him in supporting abortion rights and opposing the death penalty brennan and marshall concluded in furman v georgia that the death penalty was in all circumstances unconstitutional and never accepted the legitimacy of gregg v georgia which ruled four years later that the death penalty was constitutional in some circumstances thereafter brennan or marshall dissented from every denial of certiorari in a capital case and from every decision upholding a sentence of deathcitation needed in  marshall gave a controversial speech on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of the constitution of the united states marshall stated the government they devised was defective from the start requiring several amendments a civil war and major social transformations to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the freedoms and individual rights we hold as fundamental today in conclusion marshall stated some may more quietly commemorate the suffering struggle and sacrifice that has triumphed over much of what was wrong with the original document and observe the anniversary

where you see wrong or inequality or injustice speak out because this is your country this is your democracy make it protect it pass it on thurgood marshall speak democracy injustice none of us got where we are solely by pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps we got here because somebody  a parent a teacher an ivy league crony or a few nuns  bent down and helped us pick up our boots thurgood marshall teacher parent down i have a lifetime appointment and i intend to serve it i expect to die at  shot by a jealous husband thurgood marshall husband jealous die each of you as an individual must pick your own goals listen to others but do not become a blind follower thurgood marshall goals you blind in recognizing the humanity of our fellow beings we pay ourselves the highest tribute thurgood marshall humanity pay tribute todays constitution is a realistic document of freedom only because of several corrective amendments those amendments speak to a sense of decency and fairness that i and other blacks cherish thurgood marshall freedom today speak this is a great country but fortunately for you it is not perfect there is much to be done to bring about complete equality remove hunger bring reality closer to theory and democratic principles thurgood marshall great equality not perfect we deal here with the right of all of our children whatever their race to an equal start in life and to an equal opportunity to reach their full potential as citizens those children who have been denied that right in the past deserve better than to see fences thrown up to deny them that right in the future thurgood marshall life future children a child born to a black mother in a state like mississippi has exactly the same rights as a white baby born to the wealthiest person in the united states its not true but i challenge anyone to say it is not a goal worth working for thurgood marshall mother challenge goal our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control mens minds thurgood marshall power politics men i never worked hard until i got to the howard law school and met charlie houston i saw this mans dedication his vision his willingness to sacrifice and i told myself you either shape up or ship out when you are being challenged by a great human being you know that you cant ship out thurgood marshall myself great vision ending racial discrimination in jury selection can be accomplished only by eliminating peremptory challenges entirely thurgood marshall challenges ending jury what is the quality of your intent thurgood marshall quality intent your surely the fact that a uniformed police officer is wearing his hair below his collar will make him no less identifiable as a policeman thurgood marshall hair police him mere access to the courthouse doors does not by itself assure a proper functioning of the adversary process thurgood marshall process doors itself if the first amendment means anything it means that a state has no business telling a man sitting alone in his house what books he may read or what films he may watch thurgood marshall business alone man sometimes history takes things into its own hands thurgood marshall history hands sometimes it is important that the strongest pressures against the continuation of segregation north or south be continually and constantly manifested probably as much as anything else this is the key in the elimination of discrimination in the united states thurgood marshall important discrimination deciding not to decide is of course among the most important things done by the supreme court it takes a lot of doing but it can be done thurgood marshall important done doing we could get more action in the south because the negroes had a feeling that they were being oppressed but you take new york for example theyd give negroes little fivecent jobs here and there  and they thought they had something and the same in chicago and any of the metropolitan areas thurgood marshall action thought chicago black is an adjective in my book and the way i use it sometimes ill say black people but if im talking about a person im going to say a negro because i was taught to say that and i dont see any reason to change it i dont think that gives pride or anything else i dont think you get pride by calling yourself this or that thurgood marshall change yourself pride it was taken for granted that we had to make something of ourselves not much was said about it it was just in the atmosphere of the home thurgood marshall home said something my father had a flat rule he believed that every mans house was his castle he had a flat rule no man could come in his house without his permission thurgood marshall father man house when you hear a lot of stories about africa and you get to a place like kenya and other countries like that where they think the same way we do i was happy to find that the schedule of rights that i drew for the kenyan government was working very well thurgood marshall happy government working as soon as i reach any town i talk to the shoeshine boys or the barbers or the people in the restaurants because its mr joe doakes who is very close to reality thurgood marshall reality people reach share this page cite this page citation find on amazon thurgood marshall related authors ruth bader
