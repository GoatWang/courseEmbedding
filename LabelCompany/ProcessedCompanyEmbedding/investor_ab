owning and developing bestinclass companies we are a longterm owner focusing on doing what we deem best for each company through our international network strong brand name and active ownership we create significant value objective and operating prioritieswe are committed to generating an attractive longterm total return exceeding the market cost of capital our longterm return requirement is the risk free interest rate plus an equity risk premium in total  percent annually our operating priorities are to grow our net asset value operate efficiently and pay a steadily rising dividend grow our net asset value to achieve attractive net asset value growth we must own highquality companies and be a good owner supporting our companies to achieve profitable growth we also need to allocate our capital successfully operate efficiently we maintain cost discipline to remain efficient and in order to maximize our operating cash flow pay a steadily rising dividend our dividend policy is to distribute a large percentage of the dividends received from the listed core investments as well as to make a distribution from other net assets corresponding to a yield in line with the equity market the goal is to pay a steadily rising dividend active ownershipwe are an active and longterm owner through substantial ownership and board participation we drive the initiatives that we believe will create the most value for each individual company we have a longterm investment perspective and support our companies in their efforts to create sustainable value our goal is to build strong and healthy bestinclass companies we aspire for all of our companies to perform better than their peers and to reach their full potential however our companies are diverse and therefore with different opportunities and challenges accordingly we treat each company individually and independently our model for active ownership is built on substantial ownership we own significant minority stakes in our listed core investments and are often the largest shareholder as it enables us to influence board composition and impact key strategic decisions our subsidiaries are owned by patricia industries which offers management teams and boards coownership what we invest inwe own companies within engineering healthcare financial services and technology industries we understand well and in which we can utilize our experience and network as well as our financial expertise we have a longterm investment horizon focusing on “buytobuild” with no exit strategy our base case is to develop our companies over time as long as we see further value creation potential our business teams are responsible for regularly updating our view of the longterm fundamental values of our companies serving as the starting point for our investment decisions our capital allocation focus is to invest through our existing whollyowned subsidiaries within patricia industries and finding new ones in addition we will continue to strengthen our ownership in selected listed core investments and invest in eqt’s funds while not part of the strategy if we arrive at the conclusion that a certain company no longer offers attractive potential or that it would be better off with another main owner we actively drive an exit process in order to find a better owner for the company and to maximize the value for our shareholders at the same time longterm valuecreating investmentswe actively support all our companies in making longterm valuecreating investments which means that we are willing to sacrifice shortterm profitability for longerterm value accretive investments it is our firm belief that to become or remain bestinclass companies must have the ability to invest in innovation regardless of pressure from market or external forces however our longterm perspective is never an excuse for weak underlying shortterm performance through our financial strength we enable our companies to make the right investment decisions – at the right time access to capital in combination with sound ownership and governance creates opportunities to invest for the longterm new investmentswhile we do not actively seek new investments within listed core investments we do not rule out additional investments should attractive opportunities arise patricia industries constantly scouts the market for new companies to acquire in addition to the industries we are invested in new investments can be made in for instance infrastructure and business services however the main priority is to further develop and build the existing companies in any new investments we look for certain characteristics highquality companies with strong market positions flexible business models strong corporate cultures exposure to growth markets strong cash flow continuous focus on innovation and rd exposure to service and aftermarket sales and sustainable business models cash flow platformover the past few years we have established a strong cash flow generation through patricia industries’ whollyowned subsidiaries this cash flow together with the dividend from our listed core investments allows us to finance
