created by boundless ouchis theory z read feedback version history usage ouchis theory focuses on increasing employee loyalty to the company by providing a job for life and focusing on the employees wellbeing learning objective explain how the ouchi theory promotes a strong work force key points theory z is a name applied to three distinctly different psychological theories one of which was was developed by dr william ouchi according to ouchi theory z management tends to promote stable employment high productivity and high employee morale and satisfaction william ouchi takes japanese business techniques and adapts them to the american corporate environment one of the most important pieces of this theory is that management must have a high degree of confidence in its workers in order for this type of participative management to work terms turnover in a human resources context turnover or staff turnover or labor turnover is the rate at which an employer gains and loses employees morale the capacity of people to maintain belief in an institution or a goal or even in oneself and others full text introduction theory z is a name applied to three distinct psychological theories one was developed by abraham h maslow in his paper theory z and the other is dr william ouchis socalled japanese management style popularized during the asian economic boom of the s the third was developed by w j reddin in managerial effectivenessfor ouchi theory z focused on increasing employee loyalty to the company by providing a job for life with a strong focus on the wellbeing of the employee both on and off the job according to ouchi theory z management tends to promote stable employment high productivity high employee morale and satisfaction history of ouchis theoryprofessor ouchi spent years researching japanese companies and examining american companies using the theory z management styles  toyota a product of japanese productivity professor ouchi spent years researching japanese companies using the theory z management styes by the s japan was known for the highest productivity anywhere in the world while americas productivity had fallen drastically the word wa in japanese can be applied to theory z because they both deal with promoting partnerships and group workthe word wa means a perfect circle or harmony which influences japanese society to always come to a solution via teamwork promoting theory z and the japanese word wa is how the japanese economy became so powerful because the japanese show a high level enthusiasm to work some of the researchers also claim that the z in the theory z stands for zeal ouchis conclusionsouchi wrote a book called theory z how american business can meet the japanese challenge  in this book ouchi shows how american corporations can meet the japanese challenges with a highly effective management style that promises to transform business in the sthe secret to japanese success according to ouchi is not technology but a special way of managing people this is a managing style that focuses on a strong company philosophy a distinct corporate culture longrange staff development and consensus decisionmaking ouchi  ouchi claims that the results show lower turnover increased job commitment dramatically higher productivity william ouchi doesnt say that the japanese culture for business is necessarily the best strategy for the american companies instead he takes japanese business techniques and adapts them to the american corporate environmentmuch like mcgregors theories ouchis theory z makes certain assumptions about workers some of the assumptions about workers under this theory include workers tend to want to build happy and intimate working relationships with those that they work for and with as well as the people that work for them workers have a high need to be supported by the company and highly value a working environment in which such things as family cultures and traditions and social institutions are regarded as equally important as the work itself these types of workers have a very well developed sense of order discipline a moral obligation to work hard and a sense of cohesion with their fellow workers workers can be trusted to do their jobs to their utmost ability so long as management can be trusted to support them and look out for their wellbeing massie  douglas  one of the most important pieces of this theory is that management must have a high degree of confidence in its workers in order for this type of participative management to work this theory assumes that workers will be participating in the decisions of the company to a great degreeouchi explains that the employees must be very knowledgeable about the various issues of the company as well as possess the competence to make those decisions he also points out however that management sometimes has a tendency to underestimate the ability of the workers to effectively contribute to the decisionmaking process bittel  for this reason theory z stresses the need for the workers to become generalists rather than specialists and to increase their knowledge of the company and its processes through job rotations and constant trainingpromotions tend to be slower in this type of setting as workers are given a much longer opportunity to receive training and more time to learn the ins and outs of the companys operationsthe desire under this theory is to develop a work force which has more loyalty toward staying with the company for an entire career it is expected that once employees do rise to a position of high level management they will know a great deal more about the company and how it operates and will be able to use theory z management theories effectively on the newer employees prev concept macgregors theory x and theory y equity theory next concept create question referenced in  quiz question one of the drawbacks of the ouchi theory is key term reference

william g ouchi the thought leader interview a champion of decentralized management shows how better education means competitive advantage but only if school principals are treated like business unit managers by art kleiner             pdf     photograph by vern evansthe most pernicious management problem in the world is also the most significant it’s the problem of designing public school systems that can educate young people for the unprecedented global society that awaits them when they come of age if we take that problem seriously then we need to pay attention to the research and thinking of william g ouchi bill ouchi age  is the sanford and betty sigoloff professor in corporate renewal at the ucla anderson school of management and a longstanding expert in organizational design although he has singlemindedly pursued the reform of public school management for  years professor ouchi pronounced “ohchee” is still best known for introducing the principles of japanese management to western business audiences his bestselling book theory z how american business can meet the japanese challenge addisonwesley  made him famous as an advocate of such then exotic approaches as teambased management lifelong career paths and consensual decision making today professor ouchi is one of the very few writers who can claim substantial influence in both education and business management his  book making schools work a revolutionary plan to get your children the education they need simon  schuster is based on indepth study of the few large urban school systems that made consistent improvements in student test scores the book identified seven elements common to good school systems giving school principals local autonomy as if the schools were business units giving families a choice about which school they could send their children to making schools accountable for student results giving local schools control over their budgets delegating authority as low as possible in the hierarchy instilling a “burning focus on student achievement” and setting up schools as “communities of learners” where all the teachers figured out solutions together since making schools work was published its precepts have been adopted by school systems in new york chicago oakland calif and hawaii where professor ouchi was born in  richard riordan the former los angeles mayor who was governor arnold schwarzenegger’s first secretary of education evoked professor ouchi’s work when he wrote “if you made a list of people’s silver bullets for public education — smaller classes better pay for teachers more phonics longer school years no social promotions — the concept of changing governance structure would be near the bottom of the list none of the favorite silver bullets is going to work though unless principals are empowered and can in turn empower teachers and parents” though professor ouchi’s education research has been limited to north american and japanese schools his points seem universal for example the issues of centralization help explain the difficulties that european educators have now in dealing with children from immigrant muslim families and his working hypothesis for schools — that they cannot succeed without local autonomy — has implications for leaders in any sort of global organization who are trying to make a difference in the world around them professor ouchi sat down with strategybusiness in his office at the university of california at los angeles in january  sb how would you describe the state of education in the us todayouchi it’s dire right after world war ii the average american felt that the public schools were excellent and that children would get a better education than their parents had received today the average american gives the schools a cminus sb were schools in fact different then or is it just perception that has changed ouchi schools were very different mainly because the students were more homogeneous some people will go on from there to say that the difference was cultural they’ll say that today’s poor children come from uneducated families where people don’t understand education and don’t care about their children this is absolutely dead wrong the critical difference was this in any industry if you have a homogeneous product or service your costs go down and you can deliver results more effectively the us had that homogeneous student body in the s now we have a tremendously diverse student body which we’re jamming into the same old education factory that was set up for homogeneous throughput we need an organizationally more flexible and more complex solution sb you mean we need the educational equivalent of a differentiated product lineouchi that’s exactly right moreover school systems are much bigger before world war ii we had  million public school students in this country and  school districts today we have  million students and only  districts the typical american school district today has  times as many students as did the typical district of world war ii no company can grow  times in size not alter its structure and continue to be effective but our school districts have not altered their structure they are organized and run exactly as they were in the s and they don’t work sb why was there that much consolidationouchi after sputnik went up in  there was a hue and cry in the us that soviet children were better at math and science than american children this was blamed on having too many small high schools that couldn’t offer advanced courses in physics and math so we rushed to replace small school districts with big ones american businesses did much the same in building gigantic factories that turned out products of horrible quality at that time the productive capacity of every economy in western europe and asia had been destroyed in world war ii virtually all manufactured products had to be bought from the us american factories had   or  acres under one roof nobody in their right mind would operate such a factory today but we are still managing student schools failing to learn sb what led to your interest in school managementouchi it started with the  los angeles olympics this olympics had been a great success it made money the traffic didn’t tie anything up and it left los angeles with a real cando attitude subsequently some of the olympic organizers formed a broadbased civic improvement group called the los angeles  committee roy anderson who was then the chief executive of lockheed was the chairman i was asked to cochair the committee on the economy we also had committees on pollution health care transportation housing jobs and water and power but at the end of this enterprise we were unanimous fixing the public schools outranked every other issue in determining the future of los angeles all roads led back to k– education sb why was that so important ouchi because if people don’t have a good education they can’t afford even the most inexpensive housing they can’t contribute to the cost of their own health care they will not attract employers to locate in la and on and on so  of us formed a group called learn the los angeles educational alliance for restructuring now bob wyckoff then the president of arco and dick riordan who would later become the mayor of los angeles coled it i was the only academic member most of the others were business leaders we met once a week our question was how to fix the la unified school district this is the secondlargest school district in the us with  students only about  percent of the students in that district were performing at an acceptable level we all felt that the problem was management the district had become topheavy autocratic bureaucratic and unresponsive my feeling was that every school district in america was run in the same topdown centralized bureaucratic way so if managing it differently would make a difference there was no available evidence because no one had ever done it differently i had spent  years studying the management of very large companies and one of the most consistent principles is decentralization in a competitive world you must make decisions in the smallest operating units possible or you will go out of business the public school districts of course get students and money whether they succeed or fail this means that they can’t fail in the traditional business sense they can fail but only in terms of educating their students surely we thought if the board and the superintendent saw their management system as we saw it then they would naturally move to create more autonomy for their “operating unit” leaders the school principals after all leaders of large companies once they see the benefits that accrue naturally give more decision authority to people who manage the operating units but after several years of intense effort the learn initiative failed no one in public education seemed to care about the way that school systems were organized — or even to acknowledge that it mattered i was particularly disappointed by the response from academics in the education field most researchers who study education will tell you that  percent of the difference between a highperforming student and a lowperforming student is accounted for by the education and income of the parents and by the training of the teacher they will say that how you manage a school or a school system makes no difference but that is obviously incorrect and i decided to spend the rest of my career studying how to organize school districts sb what happened nextouchi the learn group hired a team of researchers to go around the world and look for any successful example of rehabilitation of a large urban school district they came back in  with only two one was the charter school concept — the idea of creating semiautonomous entrepreneurial schools within a public system this had only been implemented in england and canada it had not yet come to the us and the other was a radically decentralized school district in edmonton in the canadian province of alberta since  school principals had controlled their school budgets decided what staff to hire set their own curriculum and designed their own schedules we were persuaded that this was the right approach we set on edmonton as the model to study and introduce to los angeles sb did that mean persuading the school board ouchi no neither the superintendent nor the school board were interested in change at that time we started with the president of the teachers union helen bernstein then we went out and enrolled  community organizations to become trustees of learn these were groups like the naacp the mexican american legal defense and education fund and the urban league we went through massive planning sessions with them in which for example bob wyckoff and i cochaired a workshop on governance with  people some of these meetings went from  am until  at night we revised and redrafted our plan until everyone was satisfied and all  community organizations signed on to it sb why was that importantouchi many businesspeople especially in the s tried to get involved just as we did in fixing the schools they did not want to face a labor pool of illiterates to rely for customers on an uneducated lowincome population or simply to watch their communities decline with the best of intentions they put a lot of their time and their companies’ money into the fray and they came up empty i think they concluded that they weren’t wanted and didn’t know how to do it right so their efforts would be better spent elsewhere but in retrospect these efforts had failed because the businesspeople saw the need for change as a logical rational business design problem they thought all the schools needed was some good advice but school change was really a political process school board members are elected and public schools are a unit of government we could not succeed unless we developed a politically undeniable consensus in  we marched down to the school board with all of our organizations we filled the auditorium we presented the board with a box full of petition signatures they voted unanimously to adopt our plan but we didn’t realize that school board members can look you dead in the eye and tell you a stonecold lie we later found out that they turned right around and told their staff “don’t you dare implement that plan” sb what was threatening about this plan to this school boardouchi any school board is threatened by the idea of granting power to the principals and teachers that means the central office bureaucrats lose power and they will not do it voluntarily decentralize or perish sb theory z which came out in  had made a similar case to corporations hadn’t it ouchi yes in retrospect the core of our argument was the simple recognition that human beings have limited computational ability none of us is smart enough to tell our subordinates how to do their jobs so everyone must delegate authority down but you cannot do that effectively unless you also put in place an accountability system that gives you adequate control which is not easy to do it takes thought time and investment but the rewards are great this is based on research conducted on the american corporation since the mids by sociologist peter blau at the university of chicago by the aston group in the united kingdom by myself and by many others we all consistently found in every industry and country that there is a limit to the size of an effective organization if employees essentially perform repetitive tasks like assemblyline work or telemarketing the maximum effective size is about  people if employees are professionals like consultants accountants doctors lawyers or teachers then the maximum effective size is about  larger sizes produce the pathologies of centralization rising general and administrative costs rigidity and bureaucracy and the only antidote is local unit autonomy decentralize or perish sb was there a difference between your message to business leaders in the s and what you would go on to say to the education leaders in the souchi in the domain of management the message was the same but schools are not businesses first community leaders — business leaders and community group members alike — have no jurisdiction you can be smart rich and energetic but only the school board a small group of people elected every few years has any power to change the situation back in the s there was a widespread movement called schoolbased management where committees of parents and teachers and community members diagnosed school problems and recommended solutions but they had no power to change anything and by the s they had all drifted away second education is the most emotionally charged realm imaginable people care about their children even more than they care about their money a child has only one shot at first grade and if you ruin that year you’ve made a big dent in his or her life prospects so you cannot experiment with schools nor should you be able to you cannot say “i’m not sure this is going to work but i’m going to reorganize your school” and especially in cities public schools serve those who have no choice the city of detroit at its peak had  public school students today it has  everyone who could leave the schools has left them third issues of race and religion lie at the heart of our public schools why would poor or latino parents trust a wealthy white man from a giant company to actually care about their children why should they trust him and take his advice that’s a reasonable question so if you are a businessperson trying to change the schools you have to commit to be involved long enough for community leaders to get to know you and decide they can trust you until that happens i don’t know how you can possibly be effective attractive school leadership sb what happened after you realized that the la school board wouldn’t implement your proposal ouchi local community support was necessary but not sufficient we would have to build an ironclad case so we went back to research — to the study that i ultimately wrote about in making schools work we hypothesized that local autonomy is imperative in a large school district just as it is in a large company by  there were three school districts in north america with local school autonomy edmonton houston and seattle so i compared them against the three largest us districts which were new york city los angeles and chicago we interviewed a  percent sample of the school principals in each district  principals in new york city for example we went through each one’s budget and found that in new york los angeles and chicago principals respectively controlled  percent  percent and  percent of the money spent in their schools then we went to the three decentralized districts in seattle principals controlled  percent of the money in houston  percent and in edmonton  percent sb just for the sake of comparison what would a typical corporate business unit manager controlouchi of the money spent in that unit close to  percent i’m not including the money spent by the district’s central office which constitutes  percent of the budget of a large urban school system incidentally no business could survive at that rate then i found that indeed the districts with local autonomy showed higher student performance and a smaller achievement gap between white and asian students on the one hand and latino and africanamerican students on the other in short if you go to local school autonomy student performance gets better i wrote about this in my book and today in part because of that book eight school districts in the us are implementing local school autonomy sb only eightouchi well listen to who they are boston new york city oakland and chicago are each launching programs san francisco and st paul have had districtwide local school autonomy for six years seattle and houston for  hawaii is introducing a state law mandating local school autonomy which i helped draft and dick riordan who was california’s secretary of education until june  managed to pass a similar law for the state the results prove the concept boston has only  schools in its program all in hardcore highpoverty areas they issued a report in january  that shows that those  schools far outperformed the other schools in boston in student performance in new york city’s “autonomy zone” as chancellor joel klein calls it there are  schools where the principals control  percent of the money they have been so successful that new york is increasing the number of autonomous schools to  in september  sb why does giving principals control over the budget make such a difference ouchi we have a research project under way now in which we’re interviewing  principals with local autonomy and visiting their schools we’re focusing on innercity high schools which have proven in the past to be the hardest schools to improve we’re finding that control over the budget gives principals control over three key school decisions the staffing mixture curriculum and schedule the most important single indicator of a school’s quality is a metric you’ve never heard of total student load it’s the number of classes a teacher teaches times the number of students per class in new york city by union contract a teacher may teach up to five classes and a class may have up to  students for a total load of  english teachers at bronx science one of the greatest high schools in america have to figure out how to comment on the essays of  students in los angeles the total load is  in some districts it’s as high as  then visit an elite private school like those where many of your readers send their children the total load is  to  in october  i visited pilot senior high schools in roxbury and south boston — hardcore innercity neighborhoods both had total loads of  each teacher handles two classes of  students each and a writing workshop of  more students the teachers meet three times a week and they discuss each student one by one because they know every student well a young woman at an autonomy school in new york said to me “when i came here i was always getting into fights but at this school everybody knows who you are you can’t get away with that kind of thing” sb and why would the total student load drop simply because the principal is more powerful ouchi first of all the principal is the key to every school a strong principal attracts strong teachers then when you give autonomy to the principal the principal has no choice but to consult with the teachers and they invariably decide they don’t want a large school of  students it’s unmanageable so they break it down into small schools each with its own principal bell schedule and teaching staff next they get rid of administrative overhead new york city has  credentialed teachers but only  of them are in the classroom when you give principals autonomy they put their resources into the classroom everybody teaches there’s no registrar a teacher handles scheduling there’s no dean of discipline or guidance counselors they also dump the sevenperiod fivedayaweek class schedule which nobody likes it produces a tremendously inefficient use of the scarce teacher resource then they innovate at one school i visited the math and science teachers set up a combined program they all went to night school to get credentialed in both disciplines and then they created a joint course teamteaching twice a week in a threehour block the students got more class time and the teachers were in class a bit longer but they each had half as many students as before what teacher wouldn’t sign up for that sb some parents might want to keep to the old system with more advanced math and science ouchi that’s why you also need school choice every one of these districts has a system where students can attend a variety of schools without a waiver from the central office if schools are oversubscribed they run lotteries giving preference to neighborhood children this introduces a healthy form of competition no principal wants a school that’s  percent empty i visited an elementary school in seattle where they established a core objective every child including those from nonenglishspeaking families must read english well by third grade they hired  reading and math coaches drawing on retired teachers who could work parttime without benefits they changed the curriculum as well the result was a flying squad moving from classroom to classroom working with groups of five to seven students at a time in that school today black and white children have identical reading scores and  percent of them are at or above grade level autonomy and accountability sb in your book you name two other key elements the “burning focus on student achievement” and making everyone accountable for student performance ouchi they’re very important you can have a great decentralized system but if you don’t focus everyone’s attention on student achievement performance will not go up this means that principals cannot have tenure their continued employment and compensation should depend on whether or not students achieve sb what about teacher tenureouchi to me teacher tenure is a good thing american businesspeople tend to blame tenure and teachers unions that’s a mistake people don’t go into teaching to make money scratch the most cynical battlescarred teacher and the idealist is still there and that’s what’s going to save us teachers support new ideas when they prove out richard stutman the president of the boston teachers union had led opposition to our pilot schools there because he opposes differential teachers’ pay but he was quoted in education week in january  saying “we are committed to what works well we see the need for pilot schools to grow and expand” sb your views on accountability were linked with us secretary of education rodney paige who was superintendent of the houston school district when you were researching making schools work inevitably you’ve been associated with secretary paige’s program “no child left behind” where schools are judged by the performance of their students on national standardized tests and that’s put you in the middle of a firestorm ouchi i think the firestorm has subsided somewhat people were willing to write off examples of success in houston and canada but now when they see the effect of accountability in boston chicago and new york city they have to take it seriously the issue at the heart of this is balancing autonomy with accountability it’s just like in a business what allows a huge company to give a division general manager autonomy it’s the fact that you can measure profit and loss never with perfection but pretty clearly then if you’re a central office bureaucrat and you order a division manager to do something contrary he or she can reply “i’m maximizing profit right now are you saying you want me to sacrifice profit” no bureaucrat can withstand that argument so for a school system to succeed there must be a simple unassailable measure of performance in the edmonton approach which became our model there were three legs of the accountability stool first is the measures of student achievement on standardized tests which is now legally required in the us under no child left behind second they must stay within budget in other words if a school runs a deficit the principal must repay that money out of his or her own budget in the future if he runs a surplus he or she gets to keep and spend it in that school in future years and third there must be some other kind of consumer transparency as well in edmonton every child in grades  through  fills out a simple twopage anonymous questionnaire every year “is the school safe do you like coming here are the teachers trying to help you do the other children make fun of you do you use computers in class” teachers custodians and other school employees fill out other questionnaires “is the school building properly maintained are there adequate books and materials do you have adequate opportunity to influence the decisions that affect your work how would you evaluate the leadership provided by your principal” and parents have theirs “is the school welcoming is it properly maintained” principals fill out questionnaires about the responsiveness and quality of service they get from the central administration and its staff all of these results are published publicly everything is open you cannot escape from that kind of accountability nobody who is unable to perform can withstand that kind of public scrutiny sb should measures like that have been part of no child left behind as wellouchi i don’t know if america was ready you first need to have new york and seattle and some other places try it and let people see how it works sb has your view on accountability changed in the three years since making schools work was published ouchi in the wake of the sarbanesoxley earthquake in american business i have come to realize that there are no reporting standards in the education business when senior executives at enron tyco or worldcom filed fraudulent reports to the shareholders they faced criminal prosecution if a superintendent and a school board file fraudulent reports about the progress of their district nothing happens it’s not a crime there are no penalties take spending for example in every district we study my team and i always find that school districts spend  to  percent more per student than they report to the public the graduation rate in big cities like chicago new york and los angeles runs about  percent but those cities all reported  percent if a student stops coming to school they typically send a letter recommending that the student enroll in a ged program and then they stop counting that individual as a student they don’t have to follow up and find out if the student received the letter let alone whether he or she acted on it finally districts commonly test only  or  percent of their students the good test takers and report that result as their performance that was the point of the no child left behind law now schools are required by law to test  percent of all groups — white black latino asian pacific native american english learning and specialeducation children — and report all the results to the public it’s creating a furor because people for the first time are finding out what’s going on and they are horrified making a difference sb those results drive many businesspeople to suggest that schools should be privatized through vouchers and similar structural solutions what’s your opinion ouchi there are  million public school children in america fewer than  of them are on vouchers why are we even discussing this we have had two initiatives on the ballot in california to establish a voucher system the first one had a campaign budget of  million and lost  to  the second one had a campaign budget of  million and lost  to  there is a message here the public doesn’t trust vouchers they believe that one way or another perhaps in a way we cannot presently anticipate vouchers will produce a vastly more economically segregated schooling system than we have even now my guess is that when competing schools including charter schools private schools and religious schools get a share above  percent of the local student population they will become a genuine competitive threat to the district establishment and then schools improve but it doesn’t have to be private competition i’m all for charter schools in seattle by the way  percent of the children attended private school in  public schools have taken back eight market share points from them since then sb what would you suggest to a businessperson who wants to make a genuine difference in education ouchi if you go on the board of a company for the first time what’s the first thing you do you get to know the articles the bylaws the pl the cash flow and the balance sheet you need to do the same with schools businesspeople haven’t a clue how much their school district spends per child they don’t know the graduation rates or the test scores instead they walk into a classroom and say “i want to help” how naive even if you ask for the information it’s hard to get because the district doesn’t want you to know how badly they are doing they typically have six seven or eight incompatible legacy information systems which might use the same general ledger account number to refer to completely unrelated activities talk to whoever audits your company and you’ll find they have probably conducted an audit of the local school district they will tell you the information systems are hopelessly unfixable the only thing to do is blow them up and start over again this is very much a sizerelated phenomenon the smaller the school system the less of a problem they tend to have sb do you see the same problems outside the united states ouchi nobody else seems to have school districts as big even metropolitan tokyo which has  million people is divided into  wards each with its own school board and school system the curriculum is mandated at the national level but the use of the curriculum the staffing mixture and the schedule are up to the principal and no two schools are alike they’re all different given that flexibility sb as china and india enter the developing world as europe becomes more urban will other countries face the same kinds of problemsouchi yes i get questions all the time from people in china in particular where the public is growing more demanding of its public schools schools in china are typically part of the

that book • based on a groundbreaking study by the author ouchi studied  schools in boston chicago houston new york city oakland st paul san francisco and seattle that have embraced school decentralization he shows how decentralization has improved school performance as measured by standardized tests • explains the key to school success principals must be given control of their budgets

administración de las personas que laboran en la misma organización en una búsqueda que ha llevado a la adopción de distintos conceptos como recursos humanos capital humano etc ante esta situación la mirada de las empresas se dirige hacia japón país donde existe una particular manera de trabajar este aspecto de la administración en un enfoque que se ha denominado teoría z en la cual se enfatiza el rol de los empleados en su calidad de personas ¿se podrá aplicar la teoría z en un ambiente como el occidental y específicamente el ambiente chileno esa es la pregunta que busca responder este documento a través de una investigación teórica y de la aplicación parcial de algunos de sus postulados en organizaciones locales con lo cual se busca elaborar una propuesta para insertarlos en nuestra administración para una responsabilidad comunitaria como base de la cultura organizacional y con la cual poder contribuir a fortalecer la productividad dentro de la empresawilliam ouchifotosla teoría zes una teoría de excelencia ya que la noción de excelencia organizacional surge como un ámbito conceptual y estratégico en las ciencias de la administración en la década de  que se caracterizó
