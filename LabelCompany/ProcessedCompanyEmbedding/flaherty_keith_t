point of view keith t flaherty md  the asco post advertisement expert point of view keith t flaherty md by caroline helwick july   tweet this page advertisement   keith t flaherty md keith t flaherty md associate professor of medicine harvard medical school and director of the termeer center for targeted therapy boston was interviewed by the asco post for his thoughts on the findings from atreya and colleagues he believes the study’s outcomes are sufficient for pursuing a “definitive trial” of this triplet in brafmutated colorectal cancer his likely comparator would be antiegfr therapy which remains a standard though imperfect treatment for these tumors outcomes with triple inhibition may be much better he suggested “brafmutated colon cancer is one of the most aggressive forms of colon cancer” said dr flaherty “the data from this earlyphase study are swimming up against a pretty strong current” ‘lineagespecific biology’ asked how the triplet might be effectively tackling brafmutated colorectal cancer dr flaherty explained “what was quickly discovered in the lab is that when brafmutated colorectal cancer cell lines are treated with a braf inhibitor signaling through egfr would almost immediately engage and rescue the cells both by restoring map kinase pathway signaling which is where braf sits but also by activating other pathways intriguingly this rescue loop is available to colorectal cancer but not melanoma or other brafmutated cancers” he said such observations have made clear to dr flaherty that “it is not only genetic information—ie forget about site of origin—or only site of origin that matters it’s a mix of the two” he refers to this as “lineagespecific biology” he adds “when you open the door with a single drug targeting a single vulnerability the tumor system will tell you what is its next most important feature” the brafmutated colorectal cancer story is a perfect example of this approach where “we promulgate all the singleagent opportunities but then quickly try to cycle to the combinations… we pick the genetic lowhanging fruit but then engage the lineagespecific biology” ■ disclosure dr flaherty is a consultant for roche novartis and array
