security diplomacy and military operations effective communication strategy is of paramount importance a  television radio and internet news cycle paired with an explosion in social media demands it according to james p farwell an expert in communication strategy and cyber war who has advised the us special operations command and the department of defense and worked nationally and internationally as a media and political consultant this book examines how colorful figures in history from julius caesar to winston churchill napoleon to hugo chavez martin luther to barack obama and ronald reagan have forged communication strategies to influence audiences mark twain said that history doesnt repeat itself but rhymes in showing how major leaders have moved audiences farwell bears out twains thesis obama and luther each wanted to reach a mass audience obama used social media and the internet luther used the printing press but the strategic mindset was similar hugo chavez identifies with simon bolivar but his attitude towards the media more closely echoes napoleon caesar used coins to build his image in ways that echo the modern use of campaign buttons his triumphs enormous parades to celebrate military victories celebrated his achievements and aimed to impress the populace with his power and greatness adolph hitler employed a similar tactic with his torchlight paradesthe book shows how the us governments approach to strategic communication has been misguided it offers a colorful incisive critical evaluation of the concepts doctrines and activities that the us department of defense and department of state employ for psychological operations military information support operations propaganda and public diplomacy persuasion and power is a book about the art of communication strategy how it is used where and why farwells adroit use of vivid examples produce a wellresearched entertaining story that illustrates how its principles have made a critical

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a
