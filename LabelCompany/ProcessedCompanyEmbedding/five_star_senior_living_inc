forward looking statements these forward looking statements are based upon five star’s present intent beliefs or expectations but forward looking statements are not guaranteed to occur and may not occur actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by five star’s forward looking statements as a result of various factors for example five stars ability to operate new senior living communities profitably depends upon many factors including five stars ability to integrate new communities into its existing operations as well as some factors which are beyond five stars control such as the demand for five stars services arising from economic conditions generally and competition from other providers of senior living services five star may not be able to successfully integrate operate and profitably manage the new senior living communities that five star began to operate in the fourth quarter of  statements in this press release regarding five star having obtained a replacement secured credit facility and mr mackey’s statements that this facility adds liquidity to five star’s already conservative balance sheet may imply that five star has sufficient cash liquidity however five star’s operations and business require significant amounts of working cash and require it to make significant capital expenditures to maintain its competitiveness accordingly five star may not have sufficient cash liquidity five star’s options to extend the maturity date of the new credit facility are subject to five star’s payment of extension fees and meeting other conditions but the applicable conditions may not be met the amount of available borrowings under the new credit facility is subject to five star having qualified collateral which is primarily based on the value of the assets securing five star’s obligations under the new credit facility accordingly the availability of borrowings under the new credit facility at any time may be less than  million also the availability of borrowings under the new credit facility is subject to five star satisfying certain financial covenants and other customary conditions that it may be unable to satisfy actual costs under the new credit facility will be higher than libor plus a premium because of other fees and expenses associated with the new credit facility the information contained in five star’s filings with the securities and exchange commission or sec including under “risk factors” in five star’s periodic reports or incorporated therein identifies other important factors that could cause five star’s actual results to differ materially from those stated in or implied by five star’s forward looking statements five star’s filings with the sec are available on the
