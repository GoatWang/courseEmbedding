discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoverview of the funds business the fund was organized primarily to acquire interests in oil and gas properties located in the united states offshore waters of texas  louisiana and alabama in the gulf of mexico the funds primary investment objective is to generate cash flow for distribution to its shareholders by generating returns across a portfolio of exploratory or development oil and natural gas projects however the fund is not required to make distributions to shareholders except as provided in the llc agreement the manager performs or arranges for the performance of the management advisory and administrative services required for fund operations the fund does not currently nor is there any plan to operate any project in which the fund participates the manager enters into operating agreements with thirdparty operators for the management of all exploration development and producing operations as appropriate see item  business of this annual report under the headings project information and properties for more information regarding the projects of the fund commodity price changes changes in commodity prices may significantly affect liquidity and expected operating results reductions in oil and gas prices not only reduce revenues and profits but could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable significant declines in prices could result in noncash charges to earnings due to impairment since fourth quarter  there has been a significant decline in oil and natural gas prices see results of operations under this item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report for more information on the average oil and natural gas prices received by the fund during the years ended december   and  and the effect of such decreased average prices on the funds results of operations if oil and natural gas prices continue to decline even if only for a short period of time the funds results of operations and liquidity will continue to be adversely impacted market pricing for oil and natural gas is volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future this volatility is caused by numerous factors and market conditions that the fund cannot control or influence therefore it is impossible to predict the future price of oil and natural gas with any certainty factors affecting market pricing for oil and natural gas include · weather conditions · economic conditions including demand for petroleumbased products · actions by opec the organization of petroleum exporting countries · political instability in the middle east and other major oil and gas producing regions   table of contents · governmental regulations both domestic and foreign · domestic and foreign tax policy · the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration development and production of their national reserves · the price of foreign imports of oil and gas · the cost of exploring for producing and delivering oil and gas · the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves · the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves · available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity · the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital · the overall supply and demand for oil and gas and · the availability of alternate fuel sources critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of the funds financial condition and results of operations are based upon the funds financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in preparing these financial statements the fund is required to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions these estimates judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the funds assets and liabilities including the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of its revenues and expenses during the periods presented the fund evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis the fund bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that the fund believes to be reasonable at the time the estimates and assumptions are made however future events and actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions and such differences may have a material impact on the results of operations financial position or cash flows see note  of notes to financial statements  organization and summary of significant accounting policies contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data within this annual report for a discussion of the funds significant accounting policies the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that management believes are most significant accounting for exploration development and acquisition costs exploration development and acquisition costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and natural gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized costs of drilling and equipping productive wells and related production facilities are capitalized annual lease rentals and exploration expenses are expensed as incurred proved reserves estimates of proved reserves are key components of the funds most significant financial estimates involving its rate for recording depletion and amortization annually the fund engages an independent petroleum engineer to perform a comprehensive study of the funds proved properties to determine the quantities of reserves and the period over which such reserves will be recoverable the funds estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions however there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues rates of production and timing of development expenditures including many factors beyond the funds control the estimation process is very complex and relies on assumptions and subjective interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data and the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data engineering and geological interpretation and judgment in addition as a result of volatility and changing market conditions commodity prices and future development costs will change from period to period causing estimates of proved reserves and future net revenues to change asset retirement obligations asset retirement obligations include costs to plug and abandon the funds wells and to dismantle and relocate or dispose of the funds production platforms and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed the fund develops estimates of these costs based upon the type of production structure water depth reservoir depth and characteristics ongoing discussions with the wells operators and at times with information provided by thirdparty abandonment consultants specializing in the oil and gas industry because these costs typically extend many years into the future estimating these future costs is difficult and requires significant judgment that is subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment estimates are reviewed on a biannual basis or more frequently if an event occurs that would dictate a change in assumptions or estimates   table of contents impairment of longlived assets the fund reviews the value of its oil and gas properties annually and when management determines that events and circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of properties may not be recoverable impairments of proved properties are determined by comparing estimated future net undiscounted cash flows from the property to the carrying value at the time of the review if the carrying value exceeds estimated future net undiscounted cash flows the carrying value of the property is written down to fair value which is determined using estimated future net discounted cash flows from the property the fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change different pricing assumptions reserve estimates or discount rates could result in a different calculated impairment given the volatility of oil and natural gas prices it is reasonably possible that the funds estimate of net discounted future cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves could change in the near term significant declines in oil and natural gas prices since fourth quarter  have resulted in impairments of oil and gas properties if oil and natural gas prices continue to decline even if only for a short period of time it is possible that additional impairments of oil and gas properties will occur results of operations the following table summarizes the funds results of operations for the years ended december   and  and

total number of production days   oil sales in thousands of barrels   average oil price per barrel     gas sales in thousands of mcfs   average gas price per mcf     during the year ended december   production days and sales volumes were impacted by the commencement of production of four wells in the marmalard project and one well in the diller project partially offset by the liberty and south pelto  projects which were shutin during fourth quarter  during the year ended december   the alpha project reached the end of its productive life see item  business of this annual report under the heading properties for more information   table of contents oil and gas revenue the fund generally sells oil gas and ngls under two types of agreements which are common in the oil and gas industry both types of agreements may include transportation charges one type of agreement is a netback agreement under which the fund sells oil and gas at the wellhead and receives a price net of transportation expense incurred by the purchaser in this case the fund records revenue at the net price received from the purchaser the second type of agreement is one whereby the fund pays transportation expense directly in that case transportation expense is included within operating expense in the statements of operations oil and gas revenue for the year ended december   was  million a decrease of  million from the year ended december   the decrease was attributable to decreased oil and gas prices totaling  million partially offset by increased sales volume totaling  million see overview above for factors that impact the oil and gas revenue sales volume and rate variances depletion and amortization depletion and amortization for the year ended december   was  million an increase of  million from the year ended december   the increase was attributable to increases in production volumes totaling  million and the average depletion rate of  million coupled with adjustments to asset retirement obligations of  million related to the alpha project a fully depleted property the increase in the average depletion rate was primarily attributable to the onset of production of the diller and marmalard projects which have higher cost reserves see overview above for certain factors that impact the depletion and amortization volume and rate variances depletion and amortization rates are also impacted by changes in reserve estimates provided annually by the funds independent petroleum engineers impairment of oil and gas properties during the year ended december   the fund recorded impairments of oil and gas properties of  million related to eugene island  and the cobalt project which were attributable to both declines in future oil and gas prices and revisions to reserve estimates as provided by the funds independent petroleum engineers the fund did not record any impairments of oil and gas properties during the year ended december
