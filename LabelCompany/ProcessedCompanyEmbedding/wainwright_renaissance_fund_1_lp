subscription required promoter saro picciotto subscription required director elevate your investments try it for free rhode island shrugged august  rhode island shrugged wednesday august   huge hedge fund bet by cicilline and taveras under us scrutiny                                       so many questions but none from taveras  renaissance technologies and wainwright investment council are joined at the hip at  million dollars the hedge fund known as renaissance institutional equities fund llc series b was and is  the largest single investment of chairperson  angel taveras this one hedge fund investment alone accounted for  of the entire providence portfolio as of june  th  and hedge funds in general were  of providence portfolio         so we have been trying to find out more about wainwright investment counsel llc  and their relationship with providences finance director mancini and angel taveras since all the a fore mentioned have refused to disclose the nature of their relationship and the fees or costs bourne by beneficiaries as is required we have had to review older providence investment commission meetings and any suspicious investments going back several years        wainwright investment counsel was hired in november  by vincent cianci mr mancini could only provide us with one rfp for the investment adviser position in the last  years mayor taveras decided not to even put it out to bid despite his so called extensive review and category  commission also not discovered by taveras and the swat team was an accounting trick of  million dollars that the auditors ruled inappropriate in january this year because of this ruling it appears that this  million was fictitious and will be lost to the pension plan and its benefiticiaries       wainwright investment counsel  llc is theoretically responsible for advising taveras commission on its investments which are then approved by taveras our communications with and investigation of wainwright have been suspicious to say the least        the offices in boston are virtually empty and there is no waiting room or brochures of any kindthe firm doesnt answer phone callsthe website doesnt show any personnel or management team and looks sketchy to say the least httpwwwwinvcounselcom    wainwright  settled  for  million dollars in  claims that clients had complaining about having invested in bernie madoff feeder funds none of this information is disclosed on providence site     renaissance institutional equities fund llc series b is an iteration of  hedge fund giant renaissance technologies king of high frequency algorithmic  type trading recent hearings in late july in the united states senate produced a report on hedge funds using tax dodging schemes the article is linked below and as you will read  the subcommittee focused on options involving two of the largest basket option users renaissance technology corp llc “rentec” and george weiss associates there is a  page report exposing and investigating these complicated schemes providence s largest investment is in this companies hedge fund  approve by chair taveras in the past wainwright has been affilliated with renaissance and in fact they have jointly issued product before it is unclear what fee sharing or profit sharing arrangement wainwright has with renaissance because neither providence or wainwright will disclose that or confirm what exactly wainwright providence renaissance mancini cianci and taveras have not only did cianci hire wainwright in  in  mr cianci openly pushed for investing in hedge funds something that had not been done prior to that time                     bertonazzi pushes hedge funds         in the st quarter of  wainwright selected  hedgefunds and providence committed roughly  million dollars or  of the portfolio in march and april of  investment chair mayor  david cicilline approve investments in point judith capital and a large investment in renaissance rief fund the recommendation was made by eric bertonazzi at wainwright investment counsel llc for  million on april       not only did mr cicilline and providence invest in renaissance in the july  minutes board member allan edwards told new member craig baker that theyall invested in that one alsorenaissance                    providence buys into extraordinary claims of renaissance  love affair reminiscent of schilling     the minutes of february  show board members and the mayor gushing over mr dwyer from renaissance presentation there goal was very madoff like  as mr dwyer stated  we are – we’re shooting to outperform the s  p  at a minimum of about  basis points based on the long terms of the s  p  performance that means we’re looking for a return somewhere in the mid teens about a year in year out basisand then as far as volatility we’re looking to do about two thirds volatility in the market and that would mean somewhere you know high single digits low double digit volatility in other words let’s say we get – for us a normal year would be return of about  volatility of about  and that would be something that we would be – we would be quite satisfied with  mayor cicilline is there any discussion we need to have any further – do you have further commentmr bertonazzi any other questionsmr edwards i have no further questions i’m very happy that we’re able to find this eric has taken a due diligence on that and you know let success beget success i sort of – what’s been very interesting to me is your organization and i would – it would be intriguing to come visit you in stony brook we’re putting up a technology up at the school theremr dwyer you are  mr edwards you know we’re coming to the city by the waymayor cicilline yeah of course we can do this citywide we’ll charter the city planemr edwards rightmayor cicilline that is assuming the city yacht is not available like lambs to a slaughter     mr dwyer good byems york can i bother you for a cardvicechairman prignano she is going to invest she’s getting a cardmr edwards yeah i’d say myrth –ms york i’m going to put it with your preferencemr dwyer byebye everyonemr napolitano take caremayor cicilline all right so we need to do an actual motion i presumems york do wemayor cicilline or do we    so just what were the returns for renaissance and providence   according to wainwright and the city of providence renaissance has returned  annually compared with   annualized sp  total annualized return over the exact same period wainwright and renaissance above promised  basis points above the sp  per yearat  the risk this did not happen despite  phds so what riley so they didnt do what they said they still did ok from providence standpoint they didnt get killedthey got snookered but not killed  so why is it  of the fund did bertonazzi get money from renaissance like they did from madoff is renaissance another madoff or just another hft long short fund some more troubling news the permanent subcommittee on investigations is looking into tax evasion and abuse of structured financial products in july   a few weeks ago the subjects of the investigation were announced you guessed it it centers on renaissance technologies for those so inclined you can read the link below and from there download a  page report from the us senate httpwwwhedgefundloungecomsenatehedgefundsusedecbasketoptionsedtododgetaxes  united states senate permanent subcommittee on investigations committee on homeland security and governmental affairs carl levin chairman john mccain ranking minority member abuse of structured financial products misusing basket options to avoid taxes and leverage limits basket option case studies

                          renaissance technologies llc                                          george weiss associates                                              theres more probably much much more eric bertonazzi talks a very godd game and seems quite professional but is everything as it seems what is wainwright investment counsel llc why did they have a madoff feeder fund and pay  million to settle lawsuits was this disclosed to taveras or cicilline and now with renaissance long rumored to be suspicious what s up with last years co filing of a new fund managed by renaissance and wainwright does wainwright collect fees do they or bertonazzi get paid by renaissance to manage providence money how much and was that ever disclosed    notice the address   on that fund  below  for my regular readers  it is the same one i called they refused to answer any questions and no one else was there and its also  the same address my friends investigated and found eerie with no waiting room or brochures or activity of any kind if you think these are the kind of unexplained undisclosed relationships that are appropriate and not due diligence on  or taveras is right to make this hedge fund  providences largest investment than you are willing to tolerate all kinds of risk    for me i dont trust renaissance wainwright madoff cicilline or taveras wainwright renaissance fund  lp
