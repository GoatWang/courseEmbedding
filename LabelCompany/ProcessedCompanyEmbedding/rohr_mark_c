corp “my father once had me plant  acres of pine trees by hand i planted he supervised” meet the ceo mark rohr of celanese hes bullish on personal interaction—and global business by claire st amant published in d ceo september  sms celanese chairman and ceo mark rohr literally has his hands on celanese products every day even before he arrives at the office in the morning of course so does everyone else cellphone components and door handles are just a few of the technology products and specialty materials the  billion company creates it’s a good thing connecting with celanese is easy because rohr doesn’t spend much time at its irving headquarters with more than  percent of sales outside of the united states the company has production facilities in north america europe and asia rohr spends about  days a year meeting with customers and employees around the globe at the time of this phone interview rohr was on the southern coast of china looking at a potential site for an ethanol production plant in the city of zhuhai “it’s hard today if you’re a multinational company not to have business directly or indirectly related to china” he says rohr joined celanese in april  prior to that he served on the company’s board of directors and was executive chairman of albemarle corp where under his leadership the company generated record earnings and twice was named to corporate responsibility magazine’s “best corporate citizen” list title chairman and ceo age first job when i was  i served chili cheese dogs at ed’s drivein in pascagoula on the mississippi gulf coast worst job my father once had me plant  acres of pine trees by hand i planted he supervised it was a pretty bad job i think it’s illegal to do that todaybest part of your job the chance to travel and meet so many enthusiastic young people who are part of celanese while solving problems around the world management style personal open and casual with as much facetoface interaction as possiblebiggest pet peeve when the fear of failure becomes so prevalent it keeps people from taking the steps they need to be successfulstrengths working closely with customers around the world making sure our company is solving the problems that they need to address weaknesses i’m not very patient biggest challenge so much of the innovation and discovery from around the world has pushed away from the us and europe and at the same time the speed of business required today is rapidly increasing when the cycle time from start to production of a new product is four months you’re perpetually in the reinvent and redevelop stage what’s next for celanese we developed a new process to produce ethanol using local hydrocarbon resources that can be very costeffective what have you learned from your travels there is a lot of anxiety now about the global economy and the world slowing down and there is an element of truth to that but when you get out and really interact with global businesses there’s so much progress for clean fuel and clean air and good medicines that it’s hard for me to see that the world is going to be slow for very long family i’m married to a wonderful woman rachel
