etf space continues to be a favorite among investors as evidenced by the incredible level of interest seen in many of the products in the space in fact many issuers have lined up with several new funds focused on income strategies in order to tap into this sentiment   this trend continues with first trust as the company has just launched a new fund focused on the highyield dividend space – the first trust rba quality income etf qinc  below we have highlighted the fund in greater detail read first trust launches  innovative income etfs  qinc in focus   the newly launched etf seeks to track the performance of richard bernstein advisors quality income index giving investors exposure to income producing equity securities the index uses a special screening method to select stocks that pay an attractive dividend   however while selecting the stocks the index carefully attempts to control the risks associated with investing in higheryielding stocks the benchmark uses several layers of risk control to minimize the probability of dividend cuts and the related underperformance   this strategy keeps the total fund holdings to just  the individual stocks are quite well diversified as no single security forms more than  of the total fund assets helmerich  payne inc  sovran self storage inc  and reynolds american inc  are the top three holdings of the fund   however sectorwise the fund is heavily concentrated in financials  and utilities  which together comprise more than  of the total fund assets the fund charges  basis points as fees to investors  how could it fit in a portfolio   the etf could be well suited for income oriented investors seeking higher longerterm returns with low risk the current period of low interest rates makes this dividend paying etf quite attractive investors should note that high dividend paying stocks play a defensive role in a portfolio and helps to reduce overall volatility in uncertain times   dividends have accounted for more than  of total returns from the market over a long time horizon further dividend payments are expected to continue to increase in  as well as  as most large us companies continue to hold a record amount of cash and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders  competitors   though the dividend etf space has quite a number of funds targeting this segment vanguard high dividend yield index fund vym  free report and ishares high dividend equity fund hdv  free report are some of the nearest rivals of this newly launched fund read  etfs you can love forever   both hdv and vym seek to give exposure to companies that pay a relatively high dividend yield on a consistent basis while vym manages an asset base of  billion hdv has amassed  billion since inception also both the funds are cheaper than the newly launched fund hdv charges  basis points a year while vym charges  basis points as fees   however if we consider the broad dividend space vanguard dividend appreciation etf vig  free report is the most prominent player in this space and has amassed  billion since its inception the fund seeks to track the performance of stocks that have a history of increasing dividends over at least  consecutive years read invest in centuryold companies with the new nyse etf   moreover ishares dow jones select dividend index fund dvy  free report and spdr sp dividend etf sdy  free report are the other two wellknown players in this space  bottom line   given the intense competition in this space it might be a little difficult for qinc to gather assets initially moreover the fund is a slightly expensive option in the dividend space considering the fact that all of the above mentioned funds charge  basis points or even less as fees   however qinc’s unique screening method of choosing highyielding stocks and thereby avoiding the “highyield trap” might attract yieldhungry investors to this product the fund considers the fact that simply investing in highyield equities is not enough thus the fund uses several layers of risk control while choosing stocks this is what makes the fund stand out among the rest and it could allow this etf to compete with others assuming it can offer up a lower risk play on the dividend world read best etf strategies for    want the latest recommendations from zacks investment research today you can download  best stocks for the next  days click to
