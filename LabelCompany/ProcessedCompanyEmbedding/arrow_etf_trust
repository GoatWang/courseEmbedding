price are usually calculated at  pm et please refer to the arrowshares prospectus for more details on nav determination description the above chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the arrowshare and the arrowshares net asset value the market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange as of the time that the arrowshares nav is calculated usually  pm et the vertical axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed as a percentage of nav the horizontal axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the arrowshare traded within the premiumdiscount range indicated although market makers will generally take advantage of differences between the nav and the trading price of arrowshare shares through arbitrage opportunities there is no guarantee that they will do so why is there a difference between nav and market price a major reason for the difference is that timing discrepancies can exist between the nav and market price bidask midpoint reported above information is constantly flowing to and among investors corporations and financial institutions that affects their outlook on the financial markets and the value of securities this process known as price discovery is why market prices change and evolve throughout the trading day it is important to note that even when markets are closed the price discovery process continues  hours a day  days a week  days a year possible timing discrepancies close of trading times the nav of the arrowshares normally is calculated using prices as of  pm et each arrowshare normally trades on its respective stock exchange until  pm et time of last trade trading generally takes place throughout the normal trading hours for arrowshares on the listing exchange on which it is listed generally  am   pm et at times many trades are placed in rapid succession at other times little or no trading activity is taking place it is important to note that the datetime of the last trade which is recorded as the closing price may not take place at exactly  pm et when the arrowshares normally calculate nav the datetime of the last trade sometimes may occur before  pm et thus ongoing price discovery may result in a deviation between the price recorded as the closing price and the nav of the arrowshare shares calculated at  pm et therefore arrowshares generally reports market price as the bidask midpoint at
