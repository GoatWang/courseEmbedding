attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof    plaintiff contends he was not a responsible person of api and did not willfully cause said corporation to fail to remit the withheld funds to the united states upon consideration of certain stipulated facts and the evidence produced at a bench trial i make the following findings of fact  plaintiff is donald f u goebert who resides and is domiciled at  east penn drive west chester pennsylvania within this district  the defendant and counterclaimant is the united states of america  from february  to the present plaintiff has been president and the largest shareholder of general business investment corporation gbic which was and is engaged in the business of making loans to business enterprises  in early  nicholas romano and william bierlin obtained contracts to paint approximately fifty getty oil company service stations in and around philadelphia pennsylvania  romano and bierlin utilized the api corporate shell as the business entity to perform the aforesaid painting contracts  thereafter bierlin an acquaintance of goebert applied to gbic through goebert to obtain a loan to provide working capital for api  api had no funds of its own to finance the completion of the painting contract with getty oil company  on march   gbic and api entered into a loan agreement which provided that gbic would lend api the sum of  for  days at  percent per month interest in addition a placement fee of  was to be paid by api to gbic immediately upon completion of the loan closing  the loan was closed on march   in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and the placement fee was paid out of the loan proceeds  the loan agreement provided that api will cause donald f u goebert to be appointed treasurer of the corporation and he at his discretion shall have complete authority to sign all checks of the corporation and to disburse the funds of the corporation no other officer or director may disburse funds until such time as gbic is repaid in full its loan  as part of the loan transaction certain individuals including romano and his wife executed a guarantee agreement and pursuant thereto as additional security for the loan pledged their api stock along with executed blank stock powers  goebert on behalf of gbic as part of the loan transaction and in accordance with the loan documents received the corporate minute book and the stock transfer book of api  the loan documents granted gbic an option to purchase  percent of the capital stock of api for the total sum of  the term of the option was five years  following the closing of the loan transaction a capital account for api was opened in account number  with the american bank  trust company of pennsylvania the  loan proceeds were deposited in this account the only person authorized to draw checks against that account was goebert  on may   api was in default of its obligation to repay gbic the sum of   api maintained an operating account with american bank  trust company of pennsylvania account number  notwithstanding the provisions of the loan agreement until november   the authorized signatures of the operating account were those of romano and bierlin  following march   goebert received oral and written reports from romano concerning the financial condition of api  on three occasions during the second quarter of  itemizations of checks drawn on the operating account were sent to goebert which itemizations included reference to checks drawn for cash payroll but which did not include any reference to checks drawn to the internal revenue service or a federal depository for withholding taxes  api was an inactive corporation following november    on november   the plaintiff signed a check drawn on the operating account of api in the amount of  payable to gbic which check was honored  on november   goebert filed with american bank  trust company of pennsylvania a change of signature card permitting withdrawals from the operating account on his signature only the resolution submitted to the bank authorizing the change was signed by goebert as president of api  on may   the plaintiff signed a check drawn on the operating account of api in the amount of  payable to gbic which check was honored  the checks referred to in paragraphs  and  above were the last two corporate checks issued by api and honored by the bank  romano filed employers quarterly federal tax returns form  for the two quarters second and third quarters of  in which the corporation transacted business both returns were filed late the return for the second quarter of  being due july   was not filed until january   the return for the third quarter of  due october   was not filed until june    for the return of the second quarter of  two payments to a federal depository were made in the total amount of  the balance due of  for that quarter as shown on the return was later submitted to the internal revenue service by check drawn on api and signed by romano but which check was dishonored on may   due to insufficient funds  the internal revenue service filed assessments against the plaintiff for the trust fund portion of the balance of the withholding and social security taxes due for the second quarter of  plus all of said taxes due for the third quarter of  in the total amount of   the plaintiff is entitled to a credit of  toward the satisfaction of the assessment  plaintiff is an attorney admitted to practice before the supreme court of the commonwealth of pennsylvania discussion the internal revenue code of   usc §  imposes personal liability upon certain persons connected with a corporation who fail to discharge their obligation to remit to the internal revenue service income and social security taxes withheld from employees salaries the liability is in the form of a penalty of  percent of the amount of taxes withheld and not remitted these taxes withheld from each employees salary comprise a special fund in trust for the united states  usc §  the employer must report the amount of income and social security tax withheld from its employees on form  employers quarterly tax return treas reg § a § a treasury regulation § a requires this return to be filed quarterly and it is due by the last day of the month following each calendar quarter the amount withheld by the employer must be deposited in a federal reserve bank on a monthly basis for the first two months of each quarter api was required to deposit withheld taxes on or before the th of the following month it was further required to file a form  federal tax deposit withheld income  fica taxes with the remittance treasreg § c the withheld amount for those months which ended a quarter were required to be paid with the quarterly return the question of goeberts liability for taxes withheld by api involves the resolution of two issues the first is whether goebert is a responsible person within the meaning of section  of the code if so the second issue is whether his failure to fulfill the duty imposed upon a responsible person was willful there is no serious dispute that goebert is responsible under the internal revenue code he was designated as treasurer of api by the loan agreement in november of  he assumed effective control of api as president and became the only person authorized to distribute its funds thus in november of  and in may of  he exercised total control of api and had the power during such period to decide which creditors would be paid he chose of course on both dates to pay gbic his purpose in assuming control was to utilize self help in the collection of the debt due gbic he argues therefore that he is not responsible under the statute because he was a mere creditor and not a responsible operating officer of the corporation the distinction drawn in werner v united states  fsupp  dc conn is instructive werner was assessed as a responsible person when he allegedly caused a corporation to pay a group of creditors one of whom was werner instead of the internal revenue service the court held at page  the court does not feel that §  was intended to reach one who as a bona fide creditor and not as the power behind a puppet corporation importunes a failing corporation to pay off its debts obviously creditors can and do wield considerable power over an ailing business through the threat of draconian collection measures but so long as creditors limit such pressure tactics to inducing payment of what is owed them and do not seek to take effective control of the debtor in order to improve the debtors ability to pay then the mere fact of an obligation owed to the creditor and the creditors forceful demand for payment together with the creditors capacity through threat of collection to make the debtor dance to his tune ought not to render the creditor a person responsible for the debtors payment of taxes within the meaning of §  only he who actually calls the tune should be held accountable to the piper here goebert took effective control of api and therefore is a responsible person under §  in this district datlof v united states  fsupp  edpa affd  fd  d cir  cert denied  us   sct   ledd   outlines certain criteria to determine who is a responsible person under §  goebert meets at least four of the criteria including the authority to sign checks to decide which creditors are to be paid to act as an officer of the corporation and to control the financial affairs of the corporation therefore we have no difficulty in concluding that goebert was a responsible person for the purpose of imposing the assessment under §  we turn now to the question of whether the failure of plaintiff to make a payment to the united states was willful as that term is defined for the purposes of §  willfullness is defined as    willfully as used in section  supra means a deliberate choice voluntarily consciously and intentionally made to pay other creditors instead of paying the government and that it is not necessary that there be present an intent to defraud or to deprive the united states of the taxes due nor need bad motives or wicked design be proved in order to constitute willfullness white v united states  ctcl   fd   plaintiff claims he has not acted willfully because he did not actually know that withholding taxes were due of course if plaintiff actually knew that withholding taxes were due to the government at a time when he withdrew funds from the corporation to pay gbic then plaintiff would have acted willfully as defined above although plaintiff testified that he did not actually know withholding taxes were due the government urges that plaintiffs position is untenable considering the extent to which plaintiff enmeshed himself in the financial operation of api the government emphasizes that plaintiff is an attorney who was monitoring the distribution of funds from the operating account none of the checks were to the internal revenue service or to a federal depository although some checks were drawn for cash payroll finally the government urges that plaintiffs contention be rejected because at the time of the disbursements he was the only active officer of api although the government does not take the position that a negligent or accidental failure to remit funds is willful it does urge that willful conduct includes a reckless disregard for obvious or known risks monday v united states  fd   th cir  cert denied  us   sct   ledd   i find that plaintiffs causing payments to be made to gbic at a time when plaintiff had taken complete control of api after having carefully monitored all expenditures it made constitutes willfulness in that such acts were committed with a reckless disregard for obvious or known risks judge goldbergs observation in gefen v united states  fd   th cir  is certainly applicable to the facts in this case we need not condone a game of blind mans buff in avoidance of a statutory duty therefore i make the following conclusions of law  this court has jurisdiction over the parties to and the subject matter of this litigation pursuant to  usc §  §   the plaintiff is a responsible person within the meaning of  usc §  because he assumed total control over api in november of  and prior thereto was involved in monitoring the disbursements made by that corporation  plaintiff acted willfully by voluntarily consciously and intentionally making payment to gbic without paying withholding taxes due the government his acts constitute reckless disregard for obvious or known risks because of his failure to investigate or determine whether withholding taxes had been paid  judgment will be entered in favor of the defendant on both plaintiffs claim and defendants counterclaim footnotes  this procedure was approved in psaty v united states  fd  d cir  comment your name your email comments  characters remaining

individual income tax for the year ending december   in the amount of  the plaintiff has amended his complaint to claim a total refund of  the united states has counterclaimed for  which is the portion of the assessment which the government claims remains unpaid the basis of the assessment is the authority granted in  usc §  which imposes a one hundred percent civil penalty against any

attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof    plaintiff contends he was not a responsible person of api and did not willfully cause said corporation to fail to remit the withheld funds to the united states upon consideration of certain stipulated facts and the evidence produced at a bench trial i make the following  findings of fact  plaintiff is donald f u goebert who resides and is domiciled at  east penn drive west chester pennsylvania within this district  the defendant and counterclaimant is the united states of america  from february  to the present plaintiff has been president and the largest shareholder of general business investment corporation gbic which was and is engaged in the business of making loans to business enterprises  in early  nicholas romano and william bierlin obtained contracts to paint approximately fifty getty oil company service stations in and around philadelphia pennsylvania  romano and bierlin utilized the api corporate shell as the business entity to perform the aforesaid painting contracts  thereafter bierlin an acquaintance of goebert applied to gbic through goebert to obtain a loan to provide working capital for api  api had no funds of its own to finance the completion of the painting contract with getty oil company  on march   gbic and api entered into a loan agreement which provided that gbic would lend api the sum of  for  days at  percent per month interest in addition a placement fee of  was to be paid by api to gbic immediately upon completion of the loan closing  the loan was closed on march   in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and the placement fee was paid out of the loan proceeds  the loan agreement provided that api will cause donald f u goebert to be appointed treasurer of the corporation and he at his discretion shall have complete authority to sign all checks of the corporation and to disburse the funds of the corporation no other officer or director may disburse funds until such time as gbic is repaid in full its loan  as part of the loan transaction certain individuals including romano and his wife executed a guarantee agreement and pursuant thereto as additional security for the loan pledged their api stock along with executed blank stock powers  goebert on behalf of gbic as part of the loan transaction and in accordance with the loan documents received the corporate minute book and the stock transfer book of api  the loan documents granted gbic an option to purchase  percent of the capital stock of api for the total sum of  the term of the option was five years   following the closing of the loan transaction a capital account for api was opened in account number xxxxxxxx with the american bank  trust company of pennsylvania the  loan proceeds were deposited in this account the only person authorized to draw checks against that account was goebert  on may   api was in default of its obligation to repay gbic the sum of   api maintained an operating account with american bank  trust company of pennsylvania account number xxxxxxxx notwithstanding the provisions of the loan agreement until november   the authorized signatures of the operating account were those of romano and bierlin  following march   goebert received oral and written reports from romano concerning the financial condition of api  on three occasions during the second quarter of  itemizations of checks drawn on the operating account were sent to goebert which itemizations included reference to checks drawn for cash payroll but which did not include any reference to checks drawn to the internal revenue service or a federal depository for withholding taxes  api was an inactive corporation following november    on november   the plaintiff signed a check drawn on the operating account of api in the amount of  payable to gbic which check was honored  on november   goebert filed with american bank  trust company of pennsylvania a change of signature card permitting withdrawals from the operating account on his signature only the resolution submitted to the bank authorizing the change was signed by goebert as president of api  on may   the plaintiff signed a check drawn on the operating account of api in the amount of  payable to gbic which check was honored  the checks referred to in paragraphs  and  above were the last two corporate checks issued by api and honored by the bank  romano filed employers quarterly federal tax returns form  for the two quarters second and third quarters of  in which the corporation transacted business both returns were filed late the return for the second quarter of  being due july   was not filed until january   the return for the third quarter of  due october   was not filed until june    for the return of the second quarter of  two payments to a federal depository were made in the total amount of  the balance due of  for that quarter as shown on the return was later submitted to the internal revenue service by check drawn on api and signed by romano but which check was dishonored on may   due to insufficient funds  the internal revenue service filed assessments against the plaintiff for the trust fund portion of the balance of the withholding and social security taxes due for the second quarter of  plus all of said taxes due for the third quarter of  in the total amount of   the plaintiff is entitled to a credit of  toward the satisfaction of the assessment  plaintiff is an attorney admitted to practice before the supreme court of the commonwealth of pennsylvania  discussion the internal revenue code of   usc §  imposes personal liability upon certain persons connected with a corporation who fail to discharge their obligation to remit to the internal revenue service income and social security taxes withheld from employees salaries the liability is in the form of a penalty of  percent of the amount of taxes  withheld and not remitted these taxes withheld from each employees salary comprise a special fund in trust for the united states  usc §  the employer must report the amount of income and social security tax withheld from its employees on form  employers quarterly tax return treas reg § a § a treasury regulation § a requires this return to be filed quarterly and it is due by the last day of the month following each calendar quarter the amount withheld by the employer must be deposited in a federal reserve bank on a monthly basis for the first two months of each quarter api was required to deposit withheld taxes on or before the th of the following month it was further required to file a form  federal tax deposit withheld income  fica taxes with the remittance treasreg § c the withheld amount for those months which ended a quarter were required to be paid with the quarterly return the question of goeberts liability for taxes withheld by api involves the resolution of two issues the first is whether goebert is a responsible person within the meaning of section  of the code if so the second issue is whether his failure to fulfill the duty imposed upon a responsible person was willful there is no serious dispute that goebert is responsible under the internal revenue code he was designated as treasurer of api by the loan agreement in november of  he assumed effective control of api as president and became the only person authorized to distribute its funds thus in november of  and in may of  he exercised total control of api and had the power during such period to decide which creditors would be paid he chose of course on both dates to pay gbic his purpose in assuming control was to utilize self help in the collection of the debt due gbic he argues therefore that he is not responsible under the statute because he was a mere creditor and not a responsible operating officer of the corporation the distinction drawn in werner v united states  f supp  dc conn is instructive werner was assessed as a responsible person when he allegedly caused a corporation to pay a group of creditors one of whom was werner instead of the internal revenue service the court held at page  the court does not feel that §  was intended to reach one who as a bona fide creditor and not as the power behind a puppet corporation importunes a failing corporation to pay off its debts obviously creditors can and do wield considerable power over an ailing business through the threat of draconian collection measures but so long as creditors limit such pressure tactics to inducing payment of what is owed them and do not seek to take effective control of the debtor in order to improve the debtors ability to pay then the mere fact of an obligation owed to the creditor and the creditors forceful demand for payment together with the creditors capacity through threat of collection to make the debtor dance to his tune ought not to render the creditor a person responsible for the debtors payment of taxes within the meaning of §  only he who actually calls the tune should be held accountable to the piper here goebert took effective control of api and therefore is a responsible person under §  in this district datlof v united states  f supp  edpa affd  fd  d cir  cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   outlines certain criteria to determine who is a responsible person under §  goebert meets at least four of the criteria including the authority to sign checks to decide which creditors are to be paid to act as an officer of the corporation and to control the financial affairs of the corporation therefore we have no difficulty in concluding that goebert was a responsible  person for the purpose of imposing the assessment under §  we turn now to the question of whether the failure of plaintiff to make a payment to the united states was willful as that term is defined for the purposes of §  willfullness is defined as    willfully as used in section  supra means a deliberate choice voluntarily consciously and intentionally made to pay other creditors instead of paying the government and that it is not necessary that there be present an intent to defraud or to deprive the united states of the taxes due nor need bad motives or wicked design be proved in order to constitute willfullness white v united states  ctcl   fd   plaintiff claims he has not acted willfully because he did not actually know that withholding taxes were due of course if plaintiff actually knew that withholding taxes were due to the government at a time when he withdrew funds from the corporation to pay gbic then plaintiff would have acted willfully as defined above although plaintiff testified that he did not actually know withholding taxes were due the government urges that plaintiffs position is untenable considering the extent to which plaintiff enmeshed himself in the financial operation of api the government emphasizes that plaintiff is an attorney who was monitoring the distribution of funds from the operating account none of the checks were to the internal revenue service or to a federal depository although some checks were drawn for cash payroll finally the government urges that plaintiffs contention be rejected because at the time of the disbursements he was the only active officer of api although the government does not take the position that a negligent or accidental failure to remit funds is willful it does urge that willful conduct includes a reckless disregard for obvious or known risks monday v united states  fd   th cir  cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   i find that plaintiffs causing payments to be made to gbic at a time when plaintiff had taken complete control of api after having carefully monitored all expenditures it made constitutes willfulness in that such acts were committed with a reckless disregard for obvious or known risks judge goldbergs observation in gefen v united states  fd   th cir  is certainly applicable to the facts in this case we need not condone a game of blind mans buff in avoidance of a statutory duty therefore i make the following  conclusions of law  this court has jurisdiction over the parties to and the subject matter of this litigation pursuant to  usc §  §   the plaintiff is a responsible person within the meaning of  usc §  because he assumed total control over api in november of  and prior thereto was involved in monitoring the disbursements made by that corporation  plaintiff acted willfully by voluntarily consciously and intentionally making payment to gbic without paying withholding taxes due the government his acts constitute reckless disregard for obvious or known risks because of his failure to investigate or determine whether withholding taxes had been paid  judgment will be entered in favor of the defendant on both plaintiffs claim and defendants counterclaim notes  this procedure was approved in psaty v united states  fd  d cir  search this case google scholar google books legal
