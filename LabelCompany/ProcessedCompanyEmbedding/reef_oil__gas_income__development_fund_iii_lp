much as  million before the offer closes dec  the company says it will toss in up to  million of its own capital too but not all investors are created equal in this undertaking atlas’s confidential offering memorandum reviewed by reuters shows why up to  million of the money raised will be paid to atlas affiliate anthem securities to cover commissions to brokerdealers who market the deal the memorandum says as much as  million more will be used to buy drilling leases from another affiliate atlasaffiliated suppliers may also get some of the  million set aside for buying drilling and transport equipment an additional  million of atlas’s investment is not an investment at all it is a  percent markup on estimated equipment costs as soon as drilling begins atlas will pay itself nearly  million in various other fees and markups in short atlas’s  million exposure is reduced by at least  and possibly much more after taking into account payments to group affiliates and markups further if and when the venture starts generating revenue atlas is entitled to a  percent cut reflecting the size of its stake before accounting for those payments and markups atlas is raising money

development llc of frisco texas and black diamond energy inc of buffalo wyoming these documents contain details on multiple previous private placements by each company and they show that the deal atlas is now marketing adheres to a common template the issuers typically charged between  percent and  percent in upfront fees from investors while paying brokers – often affiliated with the issuer  an additional  percent of the total offering in sales commissions the upshot is that the issuer often starts out at an advantage relative to outside investors for slightly more than half of  private placements atlas issued over the past three decades outside investors lost money or just about broke even in  of those deals atlas did better than those investors of  deals reef has issued since  only  have paid out more cash to investors than they initially contributed according to reefs latest publicly available financial statements the statements show reef sold an additional  smaller deals between  and  for which it collected a total of  million and paid out just  million brian begley atlas energy’s vice president for investor relations declined to comment reef chief executive officer michael mauceli said in a statement “we have conducted our business with the utmost integrity meeting and surpassing ethical business and regulatory standards” energy ventures are by their nature risky prospects narrow bets on a single commodity wells can come up dry volatility in oil and gas prices can sink returns as atlas warns in the memorandum for its offering “these securities are speculative and involve a high degree of risk you should purchase these securities only if you can afford a complete loss of your investment” unpaid for risks beyond the inherent risks though these deals are often unfair to outside investors said david miller a houstonbased lawyer who represents investors in lawsuits against issuers and brokers of private placements investors are taking on huge risks but simply are not getting paid for those risks” he said issuers say that criticism ignores the tax benefits of their deals investors can write off more than  percent of their initial outlay the year they make it but investors in oil and gas deals comprise not just the savvy highincome individuals meant to use the tax break of the  people interviewed for this article who invested in deals from reef atlas discovery resources and black diamond over the past  years  were retirees who had low tax burdens when they signed on under us law brokers can market private placements only to institutions and accredited investors the latter defined as american residents with either  million in assets not including the investors primary residence or  in annual income those criteria were set in  since then inflation has greatly expanded the number of people who qualify now they include people like arla funk a yearold retiree who works parttime for the salt lake city utah school system in a job that pays  an hour in  funk invested  in a private placement called atlas american series  “we were looking for some longterm retirement kind of income funk said she said the broker who sold her on the deal told her she would receive “a paycheck that comes every month” as of dec    seven years after she gave atlas her money  she and other outside investors had earned back just  percent of their principal for her and other unhappy investors in private placements selling isn’t a realistic option there is no active secondary market for the securities “when i finally found out what a scam it was i was upset because it was too late for me to do anything” funk said in addition to the atlas and reef deals reviewed for this article thirteen from black diamond between  and  failed to generate enough revenue to return investors’ initial contribution black diamond filed for bankruptcy in  after a major bank creditor called its loans it never completed the bankruptcy process its principals one of whom charles koval was a founder of atlas energy are trying to sell black diamond’s leases and equipment koval declined to comment discovery resources which issued four private placements between  and  filed for bankruptcy in  as did its founder richard weyand federal prosecutors in march charged weyand with filing a false tax return for  to hide  he pleaded guilty in april and is currently awaiting sentencing weyand’s lawyer jeff boggess said discovery resources deals provided tax breaks to investors and therefore could not be called unsuccessful large and opaque all sorts of businesses – including banks heavy industry and especially investment pools like hedge funds and private equity firms  use private placements to raise money for all sorts of purposes the market is vast a reuters analysis of nearly  filings with the securities and exchange commission found that between  and the second quarter of this year issuers intended to raise as much as  trillion through private placements and that sum excludes the  issues intended to raise “indefinite” sums the number of issuers does not include those who submitted paper rather than electronic filings before  the market is also opaque the required documents filed with the sec typically state the name of the issuer the maximum amount sought and little more there are no followup filing requirements the financial industry regulatory authority the securities industry’s selfregulatory body requires that brokers perform due diligence on each issue they sell to ensure its suitability for investors but as reuters reported in a previous article many brokers rely on outside duediligence firms that are in fact paid by the issuers  a setup under which some issuers have engaged in multimillion and even multibilliondollar frauds retired engineer bill jenkins looks over documents concerning his investment in reefs income  development fund ii at his home in orlando florida october  steve nesiusin the oil and gas sector the sec data show that since  nearly  private placements have sought to raise as much as  billion brad bennett head of enforcement at finra said in a statement that brokers need to be “meticulous in their consideration of the types of customers for whom oil and gas private placements may be suitable” he added that the deals should be “only recommended to clients whose financial goals are consistent with the products and who understand the risks inherent in them” state and federal regulators have little scope for oversight of private placements and the scant reporting requirements give them little information to work with in a  alert to the public the sec said investors needed to keep in mind that oil and gas private placements were especially risky that they often carried hidden fees and that issuers routinely made money even when drilling yielded no oil or gas a spokesman for the sec declined to comment issuers stay on the right side of securities laws through voluminous disclosures in their offering documents which brokers are required to provide to investors fred rosenberg a former investment broker who analyzes oil and gas private placements for parties in legal disputes reviewed the offering memorandum for atlass latest deal at reuterss request he said the page document made the risks of the investment clear “this looks on my first reading to be a legitimate offering he said among other things the document says investors might never get their money back and it warned investors that there could be conflicts of interest between them and atlas and that the conflicts might not be resolved in their favor however rosenberg said “if the investor expects a profitable return and income stream over his lifetime  think otherwise” hard sell in the past decade investors have been drawn to oil and gas placements as a way to profit from the revolution in drilling technologies that have opened up huge stores of oil and gas in previously inaccessible locations one of them was bill jenkins in early  the retired engineer now  years old attended the money show a convention held in several locations every year that brings together investors and providers of moneymaking opportunities   at reef’s booth he picked up a printed breakdown of some older reef deals over six to eight years the flier said an initial outlay of  would have paid back depending on the deal between  and  retired engineer bill jenkins looks over documents concerning his investment in reefs income  development fund ii at his home in orlando florida october  steve nesiusjenkins then got a call from richard main who worked for reefs affiliated securities broker jenkins said main told him that reefs income  development fund ii required a minimum investment of  – more than jenkins and his wife had available – but that he could get them in for just  main told them they had to hurry though because the deal was just about to close jenkins said the couple went for it main told them to expect some paperwork “ ‘you’re not going to understand it but don’t worry i’ll walk you through it  jenkins said the broker told him jenkins received a page offering memorandum marketing materials and other documents and a postagepaid return envelope he said main told him “as soon as you get the package call me because i need to get this thing back” on the phone jenkins followed along as main guided him to pages where he had to sign when they were done jenkins said main told him “ ‘now if you can’t get this in the mail today give me a call and let me know so i can maybe work with my boss and get you into it’ ” after the couple sent the package back to main “he called back and said ‘yeah you guys did good you made it’ ” jenkins said soon the couple began receiving monthly checks ranging from  to  though the offering documents fully disclosed the risks of the venture jenkins said he didn’t realize until much later that he and his wife had signed dozens of pages of paperwork attesting to their understanding of the deal and their willingness to accept the possibility of losing all of their investment if he had looked more closely at the time jenkins would have found that the offering memorandum clearly stated that the minimum investment was  it also contained a long section about the risks of the investment such as conflicts of interest among reef’s various entities under the terms investors would turn over  million to reef and right away reef would keep  million for fees and broker commissions after that reef would receive a monthly management fee of  from the fund reef would also charge drilling and operating legal and other expenses to the fund the amounts of these expenses would be determined by other reef entities hired to do work for the venture no more than half of the money would be used to buy oil and gas properties in areas where there were proved reserves once the properties started producing revenue reef would determine how much would be available for distribution main declined to comment his lawyer john r fahy disputed much of jenkins’s account he said main never told jenkins the minimum investment was  and didn’t rush jenkins through the process dwindling returns in november  as the checks from the  investment were rolling in jenkins received another call from main he was now touting reef income  development fund iii the couple put in another  this time they got some relatives in on the deal when checks from fund ii started to dwindle they didn’t worry reef newsletters reassured them that volatility was normal but then the size of the checks from fund iii began to shrink soon they were arriving only every three months jenkins said a friend and fellow reef investor noticed that separate monthly statements from the two funds were identical money from both had gone into the same wells we called them and they said oh we forgot to plug in the numbers for iii  jenkins said jenkins and his fellow investors asked for their money back in  but reef declined under terms of the deal reef is not required to buy back the shares in  jenkins along with friends and relatives who had invested with him filed an arbitration claim with finra against reef securities claiming reef had defrauded them by misrepresenting the two deals the investor group sought nearly  million in compensatory and punitive damages finra arbitrators ruled on july  that reef securities was “liable on the claim of negligent failure to supervise” and that reef should return  or slightly more than half of the investors’ money it did not provide a public explanation for the basis of its decision reef ceo mauceli noted that the amount was far less than what the group of investors was seeking and that it did not include punitive damages the panel awarded the jenkinses  the couple’s lawyer daxton white will get  percent of the total award to investors he said he doesn’t expect the decision will alter reef’s way of doing business as long as they can sell it theyll keep doing it because they make money regardless of the deals outcome he said reef has gotten back  percent of the capital it put into reef income and development fund ii and  percent of what it put into reef income and development fund iii while investors have gotten just  percent and  percent of their capital back on those deals respectively mauceli said the “disproportionate returns” reflect reef’s “carried interest” as general partner in the deals “which is a longstanding and wellrespected standard in the oil and gas industry” he stressed that the differences also did not take into account tax benefits investors may have enjoyed “the investments we offer are highly speculative opportunities designed for sophisticated accredited investors such as mr jenkins” he said main left reef in  finra suspended his brokers license in  after he failed to respond to the regulators request for information records show he is now one of two principals at an oil and gas investment business fig tree capital ventures his lawyer said reef’s two most recent private placements are showing early promising results – mostly for reef the company has earned back  percent on a  deal outside investors are still in the hole having earned just  percent of their outlay and for a  deal the company has already recouped nearly  percent of its capital other investors have gotten  percent of theirs additional reporting by selam gebrekidan edited by john blanton

the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission the “sec” certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations we have recorded all transactions and adjustments necessary to fairly present the financial statements included in this quarterly report on form q this “quarterly report” the adjustments are normal and recurring the following notes describe only the material changes in accounting policies account details or financial statement notes during the first six months of  therefore please read these condensed financial statements and notes to condensed financial statements together with the audited financial statements and notes to financial statements contained in the partnership’s annual report on form k for the period ended december   the “annual report”    summary of accounting policies   oil and gas properties   the partnership follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties under this method all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with acquisition of properties and successful as well as unsuccessful exploration and development activities are capitalized depreciation depletion and amortization of capitalized oil and gas properties and estimated future development costs excluding unproved properties are based on the unitofproduction method using estimated proved reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers  for these purposes proved natural gas reserves are converted to equivalent barrels of crude oil at a rate of  mcf to  bbl   in applying the full cost method the partnership performs a quarterly ceiling test on the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties whereby the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves using prices that are the month unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for crude oil and natural gas held constant and discounted at  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties if any if capitalized costs exceed the ceiling an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the capitalized costs exceed the ceiling and is shown as a reduction of oil and gas properties and as property impairment expense on the partnership’s statements of operations no gain or loss is recognized upon sale or disposition of oil and gas properties unless such a sale would significantly alter the rate of depletion and amortization during the three and six month periods ended june   the partnership recognized no property impairment expense of proved properties during the three and six month periods ended june   the partnership recognized property impairment expense of proved properties totaling  and  respectively   during the fourth quarter of  the partnership fully impaired its unproved properties associated with the slaughter dean project by recognizing  of property impairment expense at december   and june   unproved properties consist of nonoperated undrilled infill and offset drilling locations associated with certain working interests acquired from azalea properties ltd on january   by rcwi lp an affiliate of reef and assigned to the partnership the “azalea acquired properties” unproved properties are assessed for impairment quarterly as of the balance sheet date by considering drilling activity in the area of the unproved properties and other information  any impairment resulting from this quarterly assessment is reported as property impairment expense in the current period as appropriate during the three and six month periods ended june   and  the partnership recognized no impairment of unproved properties   estimates of proved oil and gas reserves   estimates of the partnership’s proved reserves at june   and december   have been prepared and presented in accordance with sec rules and accounting standards which require sec reporting entities to prepare their reserve estimates using pricing based upon the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth        table of contents   commodity prices over the preceding month period and current costs future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than these prices and costs which would impact the estimate of reserves and future cash flows   reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact the partnership’s depletion and impairment calculations as a result adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates if proved reserve estimates decline the rate at which depletion expense is recorded increases reducing net income a decline in estimated proved reserves and future cash flows also reduces the capitalized cost ceiling and may result in increased impairment expense   restoration removal and environmental liabilities   the partnership is subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations these laws regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require the partnership to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum substances at various sites environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on their future economic benefit expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future economic benefit are expensed   liabilities for expenditures of a noncapital nature are recorded when environmental assessments andor remediation is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated such liabilities are generally undiscounted values unless the timing of cash payments for the liability or component is fixed or reliably determinable   asset retirement costs and liabilities associated with future site restoration and abandonment of longlived assets are initially measured at fair value which approximates the cost a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire such assets the fair value is recognized in the financial statements as the present value of expected future cash expenditures for site restoration and abandonment subsequent to the initial measurement the effect of the passage of time on the liability for the net asset retirement obligation accretion expense and the amortization of the asset retirement cost are recognized in the results of operations   the following table summarizes the partnership’s asset retirement obligation for the six month period ended june   and the year ended december           six months ended june     year ended december     beginning asset retirement obligation           additions related to new properties         retirement related to sales of properties       accretion expense         ending asset retirement obligation             fair value of financial instruments   the estimated fair values for financial instruments have been determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market information these estimates involve uncertainties and cannot be determined with precision the estimated fair value of cash accounts receivable accounts receivable from affiliates and accounts payable approximates their carrying value due to their shortterm nature the fair market value of the partnership’s longterm debt approximates the carrying value at june   as it yields interest at rates currently available in the market    longterm debt   on june   the partnership and texas capital bank na “tcb” entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” with a
