is based off of our global multicap product strategy the  stock portfolio is comprised of our “best ideas” pinpointing stocks that we view to be substantially undervalued with very strong market projections after completing a thorough stock screening we then conduct extensive fundamental research to identify undervalued companies with solid business models frequently we find timely buying opportunities when companies retain their fundamental strengths ie market share gains intellectual property healthy product pipeline good free cash flows clean balance sheets but experience stock price declines when investors react to shortterm negative news in addition to pure financial analysis of a stock prospect our research team triangulates looking at industry trends pinpointing market share prospects and speaking with competitors suppliers and customers we believe it is very important to collect as much primary source information as possible from each of these sources and assimilate this information to form more general views about the company industry global economics and final stock selection only then are companies chosen for the global concentrated portfolio

world’s best smaller companies the polaris investment philosophy holds true for the international small cap portfolio as we seek undervalued companies with strong fundamentals — only diverging due to market cap however this is far from a limitation as there is an ever increasing number of small cap companies entering global stock markets when investing in a new security for an international small cap portfolio we seek to purchase companies with a market cap greater than  million and less than  billion after the initial purchase of a security its market capitalization may fall below  million or appreciate to greater than  billion there is no formal guideline for minimum or maximum market cap of any one security in the portfolio the  to  stock portfolio has always been well diversified with investments in at least  different industry groups and countries the industrysectorcountry exposure changes gradually over time as a function of which small cap stocks are the most undervalued in the world at a given period we are mindful of emerging market exposure looking to limit investment in these markets to no more than  of the small cap portfolio visit the pear tree funds website to obtain
