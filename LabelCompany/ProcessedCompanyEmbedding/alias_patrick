catalog new product the distinctive italian furniture of alias is sold in fifty countries this avantgarde brand offers an openminded approach to creative uses of new materials and of technological experimentation that results in expressive but also durable products  since  alias has attracted a team of renowned designers with its enviable creative culture these include giandomenico belotti michele de lucchi riccardo blumer pio manzù paolo rizzatto james irvine jasper morrison alfredo häberli mario botta alberto meda philippe starck pearsonlloyd dante bonuccelli patrick norguet and eugeni quitllet it is no idle boast that the firm alias brands itself with the phrase “i feel it” alias enables each designer to find his unique expression of what modern italian design can be should you be near san francisco or wish to spend time in this remarkable city the arkitektura showrooms is the best salon to acquaint you with the remarkable modern furniture alias provides known for its innovative light and versatile italian furniture designs alias offers a broad portfolio of products for residential and outdoor environments that must be felt as well as seen inaugurated with a clear and determined vision for the future of italian furniture design alias’ story began in  with giandomenico belotti’s “spaghetti chair” one of alias’ first creations to become part of the moma collection in new york   to quote the company “the poetics of lightness find expression in riccardo blumer’s ‘laleggera chair” winner of the design preis schweiz in  and thecompasso d’oro in  alias added further solutions for the home and office environments with “sec” a modular shelf system designed by alfredo häberli to create practically an endless array of different configurations   alias boldly strode into the st century with “flexus” by paolo rizzatto which reimagined traditional upholstery by introducing holes in the back to lighten the visual presentation of this visually arresting yet comfortable couch the design of wheeled armchairs for the modern office was reborn in the partnership with alberto meda to produce the “rollingframe” and “meetingframe” while his “frametable” continues the theme of advanced thinking around a delicate appearing presentation supported by elegant yet sturdy leg supports   in  designer michele de lucchi further lightened the concept of the modern office a system of containers named “layout” the year  saw an important expansion of alias outdoor furniture with “plein air” by alfredo häberli “teak” by alberto meda and “open system” by james irvine eyecatching group seating in line or arranged as an elegant curve appeared as “ghisa” designed by riccardo blumer    what was needed in alias’ judgment was a collection of upholstered armchairs and sofas that would create an inviting and airy comfort center indoors but with the weather resistance to also offer living room elegance in a garden or on a patio as well thus appeared the “dehors” collection of armchairs and sofas by michele de lucchi    “these are just a few of the stunning italian designs we can unveil for you in our arkitektura showrooms in san francisco or at our birmingham michigan location near detroit” explains andrew fisher   fisher has just completed a sizable expansion of his floor space to accommodate the growing interest by architects landscapers interior designers and private customers in modern furniture designs his san francisco and detroit salons now represent over seventy italian scandinavian german austrian french spanish and uk and modern furniture brands    to further understand the ongoing innovation of the company that may be reviewed discussed and ordered within the arkitektura showrooms we quote alias itself    “in  alias extended its range of tables with the ‘biplane’ collection by alberto meda and the ‘stabiles’ collection by alfredo häberli furthermore the research of new design for chairs continues with the office chair ‘norma’ by michele de lucchi… the  year is characterized by new projects the ‘sandal’ collection by jakob timpe the ‘green pvc’ outdoor collection by giandomenico belotti the ‘cross’ tables by alfredo häberli and the ergonomic seat ‘dinamica’ by riccardo blumer and matteo borghi”   to enter arkitektura’s showroom in san francisco or birmingham michigan is appreciate alias remarkable sense
