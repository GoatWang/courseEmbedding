products  altairnano menu products products altairnano is the first company to replace traditional graphite materials used in conventional lithiumion batteries with a proprietary nanostructured lithiumtitanate establishing a research program in  to develop lithiumion cell technology for powerdependent applications altairnano set about to solve the limitations associated with conventional lithiumion technologies including cycle and calendar life safety recharge time power delivery and ability to operate in extreme temperatures altairnano’s research into the electrochemistry of battery materials discovered that nanostructured lithiumtitanate when used to replace graphite in conventional lithiumion batteries results in distinctive performance attributes required by powerdependent energy storage applications this fundamental breakthrough in battery technology was announced by altairnano in february  and has since been used as the core technology in the development of the company’s advanced energy storage and battery systems altairnano’s advanced energy storage systems provide fundamental advantages over existing traditional lithiumion battery designs performance the use of nanostructured lithiumtitanate in altairnano’s cell technology produces distinctive performance attributes including extremely fast charge and discharge rates the industry’s highest roundtrip efficiencies long cycle life safety and the ability to operate under diverse environmental and extreme temperature conditions safety altairnano has achieved a highpowered energy storage and battery system that has significantly greater thermal stability than any other lithiumion battery in the market by removing the highly reactive graphite from the system design and instead using nanostructured lithiumtitanate materials as the negative electrode material no significant interaction takes place with the electrolyte operating range the wide thermal operating range of altairnano’s energy storage and battery systems is ideal for applications in remote severe or unusually challenging environments where physical movement corrosion temperature extremes or electrical circuit complexity make the use of traditional lithiumion batteries nearly impossible long cycle life conventional lithiumion batteries can typically be charged about  times before they are considered no longer useful in laboratory testing the altairnano energy storage and battery systems have achieved over  charge and discharge cycles at rates up to  times greater than common batteries and still retained up to  percent of initial charge capacity power altairnano’s energy storage and battery systems deliver power per unit weight and unit volume several times greater than conventional lithiumion batteries cell measurements performed with highpowered cell designs indicate specific power as high as  wkg and power density over  wlitre by using nanostructured lithiumtitanate as the negative electrode material the formation of a solidelectrolyte interphase – an electrochemical property that impedes the removal of lithium which is the first step in power production – is eliminated put our lto power solutions

for efficient power and energy management altair nantechnologies designs advanced lithiumion energy systems and batteries contents  battery technology  partnerships  life sciences  additional information  references  external links battery technologyedit altairnanos bestknown product are their lithiumion batteries produced by altairs power and energy division the batteries have an anode made of a lithium titanate oxide formed into a spinel structure the titanate replaces the graphite anodes of typical lithium ion batteries the batteries are not the only batteries to use nanomaterials but other batteries like those from a systems generally replace the cathode rather than the anode the primary advantage of their batteries is that they can be charged very quickly in testing a  kw·h battery pack was charged in ten minutes other advantages include longer life with up to  deep cycles higher power density than other nanostructured cells wider operating temperatures and greater stability under electrical and mechanical stress ie the cells cannot catch fire on the other hand a disadvantage is that they have lower specific energy than other lithium ion cells  versus  whkg they have also been more expensive to produce at us per wh due to low manufacturing volumes the chemistry imposes on the battery industry a new methodology for evaluating batteries traditionally batteries have been evaluated on a nominal dollarswh basis the batterys increased life expectancy and depth of discharge usable energy add more scope to the formula changing it from a nominal valuation to a practical or useful evaluation for example a typical lithium ion battery might have about  whkg where altairs is about half of that at  whkg however to optimize the life of a typical lithium ion system it can only be run between about a  state of charge and an  state of charge leaving about  whkg of useful energy altairs system can be run optimally between  and  state of charge leaving around  whkg or only  less than a typical lithium ion taking into account altairnanos increased life expectancy operational temperature range and power density the battery relates well to other energy storage technologies today altairnano has three cell chemistries an ah energy cell a ah energy cell and a new ah power cell the new ah power cell has specific energy of whkg specific power of  kwkg and a maximum charge rate of c in transportation it can be used for light and heavy hybrid electric vehicles and large diesel starters in electric grid ancillary services it can be used as a super capacitor alternative and in the military it can be used for weapons pulse power as an aircraft starter and for communications altairnano will have a second generation ah cell that will be available around the fall of  the performance of this second generation cell will be different due to a new cathode the nature of the new cathode is proprietary at this time the performance will differ in that the specific power will decrease from wkg to wkg which is still more than twice the minimum phev requirement of wkg a presumed benefit to this chemistry will be that the observed cell voltage ocv vs the state of charge soc will be a smooth curve this simplifies challenges for battery control systems on electric vehicles and makes them easier to control  partnershipsedit altairnano shares its

propulsion altairnano has joined a number of other companies in a consortium called the national alliance for advanced transportation batteries naatb the objective of this alliance is to build a single production facility where member companies would be able to purchase line time to build their own battery cells while keeping safe their proprietary information altairnano is also a member of the defense advanced battery manufacturing coalition dabmc notwithstanding this partnership activity as of march  altairnano has shipped little more than prototypes and relatively small numbers of

created and maintained by the firm which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular motif index popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting compared to other motifs we base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif and how much conversation about it is happening in the community in a range from lowtohigh the volatility measurement for a motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the motif
