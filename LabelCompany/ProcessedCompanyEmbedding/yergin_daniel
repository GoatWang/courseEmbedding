predictions that world oil production was about to fall the four previous times when experts commonly predicted that oil production would soon decrease were first in the s then after each of the world wars and again in the s he wrote that hubbert peak theory ignores the effects of economics and technological advances instead of a peak yergin predicts future oil production will be more of a plateau as increasing prices moderate demand and stimulate production he also addressed peak oil in a chapter in the quest entitled “is the world running out of oil” yergins skepticism toward peak oil has in turn been criticized by the theorys defenders for example jean laherrère contended in  that yergins predictions on energy production and prices omitted key facts leading yergin to draw incorrect conclusions another industry observer criticized yergins statement in september  that the price of crude oil was then higher than justified by fundamentals at the time of yergins statement the price of west texas intermediate oil was us per barrel the price peaked nine months later at us per barrel before dropping dramatically to us in the  financial crisis and fluctuating widely in subsequent

cold war and the national security state by daniel yergin houghton mifflin  pp originally a phd thesis the product of a solid course of study supervised or otherwise assisted by a large number of leading academics from cambridge mass cambridge england new york and washington and amply supported by seventysix pages of detailed citations and a fairly elaborate bibliography daniel yergin’s book is nevertheless astonishingly free of any trace of genuine scholarship no new evidence is presented and neither can any of the arguments claim the status of a significant new interpretation as is ordinarily required of doctoral dissertations instead we have much “humaninterest” material learning in the very first lines of the first page of the text that roosevelt on his way to yalta flew for nine hours from malta  miles away that his plane landed on an “icy” runway at saki that he sat in the plane for twenty minutes until churchill’s aircraft landed also that they then drove for five hours on a newlypaved road guarded by an “endless” line of soldiers and that the climate changed abruptly as the coast was reached the point being made by a churchill quotation very british and very unchurchillian about the weathernone of the above was to be found one presumes in yergin daniel h “the rise of the national security state anticommunism and the origins of the cold war” phd dissertation cambridge university  the original work duly listed in the bibliography there is nothing wrong with rewriting a dissertation in light prose for the mass public and inserting all the grainy detail required by timestyle we all have to make a living but book and dissertation share a fatal defect that owes nothing to commercial ambition and which utterly invalidates both in dr yergin’s story of the origins of the cold war the sentiments and bureaucratic concerns of american policymakers are all brightly illuminated before us while the soviet union is a quiet offstage presence its function being only to provide a plausible pretext for the main action the rise of the “national security state” in america it is not that dr yergin deliberately intends to distort he is no revisionist out to challenge the crude reader’s digest version of the history of the postwar years with a still more distorted antianticommunist version of his own he is rather a victim of the prevailing academic fashions of the sad decline of university scholarship and of the ethnocentrism chronic in american intellectual circlesthe school of “bureaucratic analysis” whose promoters explain the making of state policy as the product of the contending interests of rival bureaucracies has been in high fashion since circa  very useful to explain american foreign policy during the ’s when decisions were indeed made in a decentralized fashion by rival bureaucracies in state defense cia and nsc the theory happened to receive its fullest exposition precisely when nixon and kissinger were about to make nonsense of its claims by acting on their own virtually uninfluenced by bureaucratic pressures but by then the bureaucraticanalysis school had acquired momentum its leading exponents had acquired professional chairs and there was in any case no healthier contending school in the flaccid chaos of american political scienceunfortunately if taken seriously the bureaucraticanalysis approach has a narcotic effect on the student of foreign affairs the russian deployment of ultraheavy ss missiles is now for example being explained as the product of a tenacious struggle for survival by a particular russian design bureau which happened to specialize in heavy missiles during the late ’s and which has enough party influence to stay in business this as opposed to the oldfashioned “monolithic” explanation which links the deployment of the ss’s to the soviet pursuit of a counterdeterrent strategy the function of these missiles being to destroy the minuteman icbm’s of our landbased deterrent ostensibly the two approaches are compatible but in practice the bureaucraticanalysis method has been used not to explain but rather to explain away in arguing against a concrete american reaction to this particular threat it is as if the metaexplanation somehow diminishes the real impact of the real event—whatever its motives in dr yergin’s case the narcotic effect is manifest throughout the book where the undoubted personal and bureaucratic struggles over policy and over the organization of postwar defense so dominate the presentation that the grim reality of the soviet union is entirely obscured as wallace byrnes acheson truman roosevelt forrestal et al are wheeled onto the scene to speak their lines as the familiar old story of the armyair forcenavy debate is retold along with many other old stories the reader might well forget that the real action was all on the soviet side with the establishment of a ring of client states and the annexation of vast territories both retained till this daythe effect of a fashionable theory that provides pseudoexplanations is compounded by a sadly inadequate scholarship since there is a certain definite level of effort required to learn a foreign language this modest but necessary tool of scholarship is naturally no longer an effective requirement for a postgraduate education dr yergin like many others nowadays has been allowed to write of us soviet relations and of europe while being innocent of a knowledge of russian or of the other essential languagesthis sanctioned ignorance is reflected in dr yergin’s monolingual bibliography and it compounds that peculiar phenomenon the ethnocentrism of american liberals while the right ignores all the moral claims of all foreigners the left has a way of ignoring their very existence attributing credit or blame only to fellow americans whether in the case of vietnam or of the cold warit is for these reasons that dr yergin’s version of the origins of the cold war is little more than an optical delusion in which the moving train of russian power is made to appear still while the reader kept in the hesitant train of american decision has the illusion of reciprocal movement at the end of the book one may find the full evidence for this verdict having brought his entire story of diverse american prejudices hopes and interests to a culmination in the spring of  with the drafting of nsc—a document which belatedly set out a comprehensive strategy for the containment of soviet power—dr yergin duly notes that congress seemed unwilling to fund the rearmament which the new strategy required american forces hurriedly demobilized by  were very small and grossly underarmed by  their equipment was in many cases decrepit and indeed american military power amounted to very little except for the atomic bomb by then possessed by the soviet union also nsc advocated an effective deterrence and this required the rebuilding of a realistic army navy and air force very likely the document would have remained a dead letter but then an unexpected event occurred i quotethe administration was still wrestling with the question of how to get funding for the nsc program when in the early morning hours of june  east asian time north korea threw its troops across the border to the souththus began the korean warthe administration certainly did not want that war but once embroiled in the conflict it did not hesitate to use it to promote the general buildup of american military strengththere follows a gloating quote from aviation week on how well the aircraft industry was doing by december  then dr yergin writeswith the korean conflict a new phase had opened in the cold warwith the expanded funding the architecture of the national security state was completeso at last we finally discover exactly what is meant by that sinister phrase a “national security state” is a state which has an army a navy and an air force as well as a centralized intelligence department a proper foreign office and a unified department of defense it took pearl harbor to endow the united states with these common attributes of external power which are so prosaic to the nonisolationist mind all were then willfully dismantled in  while a broad segment of european life was being handed over to the benevolent care of josef stalin americans of diverse opinions who feared the consequences of further russian expansion then began to agitate for a policy of effective resistance by the united states on the whole they failed and stalin unfortunately did not respect declaratory policies unsupported by effective military power then there is another pearl harbor this time in korea and the united states rearms once againin other words the real action in the “rise of the national security state” takes place in tokyo  moscow  and perhaps in pyongyang in  what a pity that it cannot now be established how kim il sung felt on the morning of the attack or what stalin wore as he watched roosevelt’s plane take off after yalta and of course there is a scarcity of those pungent quotes which the timestyle requires but looking where

commentary meir y soloveichik  meir y soloveichik  june   shares facebook twitter google email print a i t can be said that the book of samuel launched the american revolution though antagonistic to traditional faith thomas paine understood that it was not montesquieu or locke who was inscribed on the hearts of his fellow americans paine’s pamphlet common sense is a biblical argument against british monarchy drawing largely on the text of samueltoday of course universal biblical literacy no longer exists in america and sophisticated arguments from scripture are all too rare it is therefore all the more distressing when public intellectuals academics or religious leaders engage in clumsy acts of exegesis and political argumentation by comparing characters in the book of samuel to modern political leaders the most common victim of this tendency has been the central character in the book of samuel king davidmost recently this tendency was made manifest in the writings of dennis prager in a recent defense of his own praise of president trump prager wrote that “as a religious jew i learned from the bible that god himself chose morally compromised individuals to accomplish some greater good think of king david who had a man killed in order to cover up the adultery he committed with the man’s wife” prager similarly argued that those who refuse to vote for a politician whose positions are correct but whose personal life is immoral “must think god was pretty flawed in voting for king david”prager’s invocation of king david was presaged on the left two decades ago the records of the clinton presidential library reveal that at the height of the lewinsky scandal an email from dartmouth professor susannah heschel made its way into the inbox of an administration policy adviser with a similar comparison “from the perspective of jewish history we have to ask how jews can condemn president clinton’s behavior as immoral when we exalt king david king david had batsheva’s husband uriah murdered while david was condemned and punished he was never thrown off the throne of israel on the contrary he is exalted in our jewish memory as the unifier of israel”one can make the case for supporting politicians who have significant moral flaws indeed america’s political system is founded on an awareness of the profound tendency to sinfulness not only of its citizens but also of its statesmen “if men were angels no government would be necessary” james madison informs us in the federalist at the same time anyone who compares king david to the flawed leaders of our own age reveals a profound misunderstanding of the essential nature of david’s greatness david was not chosen by god despite his moral failings rather david’s failings are the lens that reveal his true greatness it is in the wake of his sins that david emerges as the paradigmatic penitent whose quest for atonement is utterly unlike that of any other character in the bible and perhaps in the history of the worldwhile the precise nature of david’s sins is debated in the talmud there is no question that they are profound yet it is in comparing david to other faltering figures—in the bible or today—that the comparison falls flat this point is stressed by the very jewish tradition in whose name prager claimed to speakit is the rabbis who note that david’s predecessor saul lost the kingship when he failed to fulfill god’s command to destroy the egregiously evil nation of amalek whereas david commits more severe sins and yet remains king the answer the rabbis suggest lies not in the sin itself but in the response saul when confronted by the prophet samuel offers obfuscations and defensiveness david meanwhile is similarly confronted by the prophet nathan “thou hast killed uriah the hittite with the sword and hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the sword of the children of ammon” david’s immediate response is clear and complete contrition “i have sinned against the lord” david’s penitence jewish tradition suggests sets him apart from saul soon after david gave voice to what was in his heart at the moment and gave the world one of the most stirring of the psalmshave mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me   deliver me from bloodguiltiness o god thou god of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousnesso lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise for thou desirest not sacrifice else would i give it thou delightest not in burnt offeringthe sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despisethe tendency to link david to our current age lies in the fact that we know more about david than any other biblical figure the author thomas cahill has noted that in a certain literary sense david is the only biblical figure that is like us at all prior to the humanist autobiographies of the renaissance he notes “we can count only a few isolated instances of this use of ‘i’ to mean the interior self but david’s psalms are full of i’s” in david’s psalms cahill writes we “find a unique early roadmap to the inner spirit—previously mute—of ancient humanity”at the same time a study of the book of samuel and of the psalms reveals how utterly incomparable david is to anyone alive today haym soloveitchik has noted that even the most observant of jews today fail to feel a constant intimacy with god that the simplest jew of the premodern age might have felt that “while there are always those whose spirituality is one apart from that of their time nevertheless i think it safe to say that the perception of god as a daily natural force is no longer present to a significant degree in any sector of modern jewry even the most religious” yet for david such intimacy with the divine was central to his existence and the book of samuel and the psalms are an eternal testament to this fact this is why simple comparisons between david and ourselves as tempting as they are must be resisted david wolpe in his book about david attempts to make the case as to why king david’s life speaks to us today “so versatile and enduring is david in our culture that rare is the week that passes without some public allusion to his life…we need to understand david better because we use his life to comprehend our own”the truth may be the opposite we need to understand david better because we can use his life to comprehend what we are missing and how utterly unlike our lives are to his own for even the most religious among us have lost the profound faith and intimacy with god that david had it is therefore incorrect to assume that because of david’s flaws it would have been as amos oz has written “fitting for him to reign in tel aviv” the modern state of israel was blessed with brilliant leaders but to which of its modern warriors or statesmen should david be compared to ben gurion who stripped any explicit invocation of the divine from israel’s declaration of independence to moshe dayan who oversaw the reconquest of jerusalem and then immediately handed back the temple mount the locus of king david’s dreams and desires to the administration of the enemies of israel david’s complex humanity inspires comparison to modern figures but his faith contrition and repentance—which lie at the heart of his story and success—defy any such engagementand so to those who seek comparisons to modern leaders from the bible the best rule may be leave king david out of it choose your plan and

rothman foreign affairs terror and the failure of the liberal imaginationthree attacks in britain highlight the west’s inability to see the threat clearly jonathan foreman  jonathan foreman  june   shares facebook twitter google email print a t he real lesson of the recent terrorist attacks in the uk is not that all open western societies are frighteningly vulnerable it is not that our homegrown terrorists have finally realized that lowtech attacks using vehicles and knives are easy to carry out and hard to prevent nor is it that our population is impressively courageous in the face of such attacks the real lesson is that the british state and the british political class are and have long been fundamentally unserious about the dangers presented by islamist terrorismthis lack of seriousness manifests itself in several ways it’s perhaps most obvious in the failure to reform britain’s chaotic immigration and dysfunctional asylum systems but it’s also abundantly clear from the grotesque underfunding and underresourcing of domestic intelligence in mi britain has an internal security service that is simply too small to do its job effectively even if it were not handicapped by an institutional culture that can seem willfully blind to the ideological roots of the current terrorism problemin  jonathan evans then head of mi confessed at a parliamentary hearing about the london bus and subway attacks of  that his organization only had sufficient resources to “hit the crocodiles close to the boat” it was an extraordinary metaphor to use not least because of the impression of relative impotence that it conveys mi had by then doubled in size since  but it still boasted a staff of only  today it’s said to employ between  and  an astonishingly even laughably small number given a uk population of  million and the scale of the security challenges britain now faces to be fair the major british police forces all have intelligence units devoted to terrorism and the uk government’s overall counterterrorism strategy involves a great many people including social workers and schoolteachersyou can also see that unseriousness at work in the abject failure to coerce britain’s often remarkably sedentary police officers out of their cars and stations and back onto the streets most of britain’s bigcity police forces have adopted a reactive model of policing consciously rejecting both the new york compstat model and british “bobby on the beat” traditions that cripples intelligencegathering and frustrates good community relationsif that weren’t bad enough britain’s judiciary is led by jurists who came of age in the s and who have been inclined since  to treat terrorism as an ordinary criminal problem being exploited by malign officials and politicians to make assaults on individual rights and to take part in “illegal” foreign wars it has long been almost impossible to extradite isis or alqaeda–linked islamists from the uk this is partly because today’s english judges believe that few if any foreign countries—apart from perhaps sweden and norway—are likely to give terrorist suspects a fair trial or able to guarantee that such suspects will be spared torture and abusewe have a progressive metropolitan media elite whose primary reflexive response to every terrorist attack even before the blood on the pavement is dry is to express worry about an imminent violent antimuslim “backlash” on the part of a presumptively bigoted and ignorant indigenous working class never mind that no such “backlash” has yet occurred not even when the young offduty soldier lee rigby was hacked to death in broad daylight on a south london street in another sign of this lack of seriousness is the choice by successive british governments to deal with the problem of internal terrorism with marketing and “branding” you can see this in the catchy consultantcreated acronyms and pseudostrategies that are deployed in place of considered thought and action after every atrocity the prime minister calls a meeting of the cobra unit—an acronym that merely stands for cabinet office briefing room a but sounds like a secret organization of government superheroes the government’s counterterrorism strategy is called contest which has four “work streams” “prevent” “pursue” “protect” and “prepare”perhaps the ultimate sign of unseriousness is the fact that police politicians and government officials have all displayed more fear of being seen as “islamophobic” than of any carnage that actual terror attacks might cause few are aware that this shortterm cowardly and trivial tendency may ultimately foment genuine dangerous popular islamophobia especially if attacks continue r ecently three murderous islamist terror attacks in the uk took place in less than a month the first and third were relatively primitive improvised attacks using vehicles andor knives the second was a suicide bombing that probably required relatively sophisticated planning technological knowhow and the assistance of a terrorist infrastructure as they were the first such attacks in the uk the vehicle and knife killings came as a particular shock to the british press public and political class despite the fact that nonexplosive and nonfirearm terror attacks have become common in europe and are almost routine in israelthe success of all three plots indicates troubling problems in british lawenforcement practice and culture quite apart from any other failings on the parts of the state in charge of intelligence border control and the prevention of radicalization at the time of writing the british media have been full of encomia to police courage and skill not least because it took “only” eight minutes for an armed metropolitan police team to respond to and confront the bloody mayhem being wrought by the three islamist terrorists who had ploughed their rented van into people on london bridge before jumping out to attack passersby with knives but the difficult truth is that all three attacks would be much harder to pull off in manhattan not just because all nypd cops are armed but also because there are always police officers visibly on patrol at the new york equivalents of london’s borough market on a saturday night by contrast london’s metropolitan police is a largely vehicleborne reactive force rather than use a physical presence to deter crime and terrorism it chooses to monitor closedcircuit street cameras and socialmedia postingssince the attacks in london and manchester we have learned that several of the perpetrators were “known” to the police and security agencies that are tasked with monitoring potential terror threats that these individuals were nevertheless able to carry out their atrocities is evidence that the monitoring regime is insufficientit also seems clear that there were failures on the part of those institutions that come under the leadership of the home office and are supposed to be in charge of the uk’s border migration and asylum systems journalists and think tanks like policy exchange and migration watch have for years pointed out that these systems are “unfit for purpose” but successive governments have done little to take responsible control of britain’s borders when she was home secretary prime minister theresa may did little more than jazz up the name logo and uniforms of what is now called the “border force” and she notably failed to put in place longpromised passport checks for people flying out of the country this dereliction means that it is impossible for the british authorities to know who has overstayed a visa or whether individuals who have been denied asylum have actually left the countryit seems astonishing that youssef zaghba one of the three london bridge attackers was allowed back into the country the moroccanborn italian citizen his mother is italian had been arrested by italian police in bologna apparently on his way to syria via istanbul to join isis when questioned by the italians about the isis decapitation videos on his mobile phone he declared that he was “going to be a terrorist” the italians lacked sufficient evidence to charge him with a crime but put him under hour surveillance and when he traveled to london they passed on information about him to mi nevertheless he was not stopped or questioned on arrival and had not become one of the  official terrorism “subjects of interest” for mi or the police when he carried out his attack one reason zaghba was not questioned on arrival may have been that he used one of the new selfservice passport machines installed in uk airports in place of human staff after may’s cuts to the border force apparently the machines are not yet linked to any government watch lists thanks to the general chaos and ineptitude of the home office’s efforts to use information technologythe presence in the country of zaghba’s accomplice rachid redouane is also an indictment of the incompetence and disorganization of the uk’s border and migration authorities he had been refused asylum in  but as is so often the case britain’s home office never got around to removing him three years later he married a british woman and was therefore able to stay in the ukbut it is the failure of the authorities to monitor ringleader khuram butt that is the most baffling he was a known and open associate of anjem choudary britain’s most notorious terrorist supporter ideologue and recruiter he was finally imprisoned in  after  years of campaigning on behalf of alqaeda and isis butt even appeared in a  tv documentary about isis supporters called the jihadist next door in the same year he assaulted a moderate imam at a public festival after calling him a “murtad” or apostate the imam reported the incident to the police—who took six months to track him down and then let him off with a caution it is not clear if butt was one of the  “subjects of interest” or the additional  former subjects of interest who continue to be the subject of limited monitoring if he was not it raises the question of what a person has to do to get british security services to take him seriously as a terrorist threat if he was in fact on the list of “subjects of interest” one has to wonder if being so designated is any barrier at all to carrying out terrorist atrocities it’s worth remembering as few do here in the uk that terrorists who carried out previous attacks were also known to the police and security services and nevertheless enjoyed sufficient liberty to go at it again b ut the most important reason for the british state’s ineffectiveness in monitoring terror threats which may addressed immediately after the london bridge attack is a deeply rooted institutional refusal to deal with or accept the key role played by islamist ideology for more than  years the security services and police have chosen to take note only of people and bodies that explicitly espouse terrorist violence or have contacts with known terrorist groups the fact that a person school imam or mosque endorses the establishment of a caliphate the stoning of adulterers or the murder of apostates has not been considered a reason to monitor themthis seems to be why salman abedi the manchester arena suicide bomber was not being watched by the authorities as a terror risk even though he had punched a girl in the face for wearing a short skirt while at university had attended the muslim brotherhoodcontrolled didsbury mosque was the son of a libyan man whose militia is banned in the uk had himself fought against the qaddafi regime in libya had adopted the islamist clothing style trousers worn above the ankle beard but no moustache was part of a druggy gang subculture that often feeds individuals into islamist terrorism and had been banned from a mosque after confronting an imam who had criticized isisit was telling that the day after the manchester arena suicidebomb attack you could hear security officials informing radio and tv audiences of the bbc’s flagship morningradio news show that it’s almost impossible to predict and stop such attacks because the perpetrators “don’t care who they kill” they just want to kill as many people as possible he saidsurely anyone with even a basic familiarity with islamist terror attacks over the last  or so years and a nodding acquaintance with islamist ideology could see that the terrorist hadn’t just chosen the ariana grande concert in manchester arena because a lot of random people would be crowded into a conveniently small area since the bali bombings of  nightclubs discotheques and pop concerts attended by shameless unveiled women and girls have been routinely targeted by fundamentalist terrorists including in britain among the worrying things about the opinion offered on the radio show was that it suggests that even in the wake of the horrific bataclan attack in paris during a november  concert british authorities may not have been keeping an appropriately protective eye on music venues and other places where our young people hang out in their decadent western way such dereliction would make perfect sense given the resistance on the part of the british security establishment to examining confronting or extrapolating from islamist ideologythe same phenomenon may explain why authorities did not follow up on community complaints about abedi all too often when people living in britain’s many and diverse muslim communities want to report suspicious behavior they have to do so through offices and organizations set up and paid for by the authorities as part of the overall “prevent” strategy although criticized by the left as “islamophobic” and inherently stigmatizing prevent has often brought the government into cooperative relationships with organizations even further to the islamic right than the muslim brotherhood this means that if you are a relatively secular libyan émigré who wants to report an abedi and you go to your local police station you are likely to find yourself speaking to a bearded islamistfrom its outset in  the prevent strategy was flawed its practitioners in their zeal to find and fund key allies in “the muslim community” as if there were just one routinely made alliances with selfappointed community leaders who represented the most extreme and intolerant tendencies in british islam both the home office and mi seemed to believe that only radical muslims were “authentic” and would therefore be able to influence young potential terrorists moderate modern liberal muslims who are arguably more representative of british islam as a whole not to mention sundry shiites sufis ahmmadis and ismailis have too often found it hard to get a hearingsunni organizations that openly supported suicidebomb attacks in israel and india and that justified attacks on british troops in iraq and afghanistan nevertheless received government subsidies as part of prevent the hope was that in return they would alert the authorities if they knew of individuals planning attacks in the uk itselfit was a gamble reminiscent of british colonial practice in india’s northwest frontier and elsewhere not only were there financial inducements in return for grudging cooperation the british state offered other symbolically powerful concessions these included turning a blind eye to certain crimes and antisocial practices such as female genital mutilation there have been no successful prosecutions relating to the practice though thousands of cases are reported every year forced marriage child marriage polygamy the mass removal of girls from school soon after they reach puberty and the epidemic of racially and religiously motivated “grooming” rapes in cities like rotherham at the same time foreign jihadists—including men wanted for crimes in algeria and france—were allowed to remain in the uk as long as their plots did not include british targetsthis approach simultaneously cynical and naive was never as successful as its proponents hoped again and again muslim chaplains who were approved to work in prisons and other institutions have sometimes turned out to be islamist extremists whose words have inspired inmates to join terrorist organizationsmuch to his credit former prime minister david cameron fought hard to change this approach even though it meant difficult confrontations with his home secretary theresa may as well as police and the intelligence agencies however cameron’s efforts had little effect on the permanent personnel carrying out the prevent strategy and cooperation with islamist but currently nonviolent organizations remains the default setting within the institutions on which the united kingdom depends for securitythe failure to understand the role of ideology is one of imagination as well as education very few of those who make government policy or write about homegrown terrorism seem able to escape the limitations of what used to be called “bourgeois” experience they assume that anyone willing to become an islamist terrorist must perforce be materially deprived or traumatized by the experience of prejudice or provoked to murderous fury by oppression abroad they have no sense of the emotional and psychic benefits of joining a secret terror outfit the excitement and glamor of becoming a kind of islamic james bond bravely defying the forces of an entire modern state they don’t get how satisfying or empowering the vengeful misogyny of isisstyle fundamentalism might seem for geeky frustrated young men nor can they appreciate the appeal to the adolescent mind of apocalyptic fantasies of power and sacrifice mainstream british society does not have much room for warrior dreams given that its tone is set by liberal pacifists finally they have no sense of why the discipline and selfdiscipline of fundamentalist islam might appeal so strongly to incarcerated lumpen youth who have never experienced boundaries or real belonging their understanding is an understanding only of themselves not of the people who want to kill them choose your plan and pay nothing for six weeksfor a very

williams scolds her fellow professors lawyers and other professional types for their indifference and intolerance toward their less educated white   fellowcitizens she relates the story of a friend who tells her “the thing that really gets me is that democrats try to offer policies paid sick leave minimum wage that would help the working class” williams’s response “a few days’ paid leave ain’t gonna support a family nor is minimum wage” later on in the book she writes “when i hear some environmentalists talk i feel like i’m listening to my german jewish grandmother calling russian jews peasants”williams is a prominent feminist legal scholar with degrees from yale mit and harvard unbending gender her bestknown book is the sort of tract you’d expect to find at an intersectionality conference or a portlandia bookstore this is why her insightful empathic book comes as such a surprisebooks and essays on the topic have accumulated into a highly visible genre since donald trump came on the american political scene jd vance’s hillbilly elegy planted itself at the top of bestseller lists almost a year ago and still isn’t budging as with vance williams’s interest in the topic is personal she fell “madly in love with” and eventually married a harvard law school graduate who had grown up in an italian neighborhood in pregentrification brooklyn williams on the other hand is a “silverspoon girl” her father’s family was moneyed and her maternal grandfather was a prominent reform rabbithe author’s affection for her “classmigrant” spouse and respect for his family’s hardships—“my fatherinlaw grew up on blood soup” she announces in her opening sentence—adds considerable warmth to what is at bottom a political pamphlet williams believes that elite condescension and “cluelessness” played a big role in trump’s unexpected and dreaded victory enlightening her fellow elites is essential to the task of returning trump voters to the progressive fold where she is sure they rightfully belongliberals were not always so dense about the working class williams observes wpa murals and movies like on the waterfront showed genuine fellow feeling for the proletariat in the s however the liberal mood changed educated boomers shifted their attention to “issues of peace equal rights and environmentalism” instead of feeling the pain of arthur miller and john steinbeck characters they began sneering at the less enlightened these days she notes elite sympathies are limited to the poor people of color poc and the lgbtq population despite clear evidence of suffering—stagnant wages disappearing manufacturing jobs declining health and wellbeing—the working class gets only flyover snobbery at best and more often outright loathingwilliams divides her chapters into a series of explainers to questions she has heard from her clueless friends and colleagues “why does the working class resent the poor” “why does the working class resent professionals but admire the rich” “why doesn’t the working class just move to where the jobs are” “is the working class just racist” she weaves her answers into a compelling picture of a way of life and worldview foreign to her targeted readers workingclass americans have had to struggle for whatever stability and comfort they have she explains clocking in for midnight shifts year after year enduring capricious bosses plant closures and layoffs they’re reliant on tagteam parenting and stressedout relatives for child care the campus goto word “privileged” seems exactly wrongproud of their own selfsufficiency and success however modest they don’t begrudge the selfmade rich it’s snooty professionals and the dysfunctional poor who get their goat from their vantage point subsidizing the day care for a welfare mother when they themselves struggle to manage care on their own dime mocks both their hard work and their beliefs and since unlike most professors they shop in the same stores as the dependent poor they’ve seen that some of them game the system of course that stingswhite working class is especially good at evoking the alternate economic and mental universe experienced by professional and managerial elites or “pmes” pmes see their nonjudgment of the poor especially those who are “poc” as a mark of their mature understanding that we live in an unjust racist system whose victims require compassion regardless of whether they have committed any crime at any rate their passions lie elsewhere they define themselves through their jobs and professional achievements hence their obsession with glass ceilingswilliams tells the story of her husband’s faux pas at a highschool reunion forgetting his roots for a moment the ivy league–educated lawyer asked one of his brooklyn classmates a question that is the goto opener in elite social settings “what do you do” angered by what must have seemed like deliberate humiliation by this prodigal son the man hissed “i sell toilets”instead of stability and backyard barbecues with family and longtime neighbors and maybe the occasional olive garden celebration pmes are enamored of novelty new foods new restaurants new friends new experiences the working class chooses to spend its leisure in comfortable familiarity for the elite social life is a lot like networking members of the professional class may view themselves as sophisticated or cosmopolitan but williams shows to the bluecollar worker their gladhanding is closer to phony social climbing and their abstract knowledgeeconomy jobs more like selfimportant pencilpushingwhite working class has a number of proposals for creating the progressive future williams would like to see she wants to get rid of collegeforall dogma and improve training for middleskill jobs she envisions a workingclass coalition of all races and ethnicities bolstered by civics education with a “distinctly celebratory view of american institutions” in a saner political environment some of this would make sense indeed she echoes some of marco rubio’s  campaign themes it’s little wonder white working class has already gotten the stink eye from liberal reviewers for its purported sympathies for racistsalas impressive as williams’s insights are they do not always allow her to transcend her own class loyalties unsurprisingly her own pme biases mostly come to light in her chapters on race and gender she reduces immigration concerns to “fear of brown people” even as she notes elsewhere that a quarter of latinos also favor a wall at the southern border this contrasts startlingly with her succinct observation that “if you don’t want to drive workingclass whites to be attracted to the likes of limbaugh stop insulting them” in one particularly obtuse moment she asserts “because i study social inequality i know that even malia and sasha obama will be disadvantaged by race advantaged as they are by class” she relies on dubious gender theories to explain why the majority of white women voted for trump rather than for his unfairly maligned opponent that hillary clinton epitomized every elite quality williams has just spent more than a hundred pages explicating escapes her notice williams’s own reflexive retreat into identity politics is itself emblematic of our toxic divisions but it does not invalidate the power of this astute

t he story of european classical music under the third reich is one of the most squalid chapters in the annals of western culture a chronicle of collective complaisance that all but beggars belief without exception all of the wellknown musicians who left germany and austria in protest when hitler came to power in  were either jewish or like the violinist adolf busch rudolf serkin’s fatherinlaw had close family ties to jews moreover most of the small number of nonjewish musicians who emigrated later on such as paul hindemith and lotte lehmann are now known to have done so not out of principle but because they were unable to make satisfactory accommodations with the nazis everyone else—including karl böhm wilhelm furtwängler walter gieseking herbert von karajan and richard strauss—stayed behind and served the reichthe berlin and vienna philharmonics then as now europe’s two greatest orchestras were just as willing to do business with hitler and his henchmen firing their jewish members and ceasing to perform the music of jewish composers even after the war the vienna philharmonic was notorious for being the most antisemitic orchestra in europe and it was well known in the music business though never publicly discussed that helmut wobisch the orchestra’s principal trumpeter and its executive director from  to  had been both a member of the ss and a gestapo spythe management of the berlin philharmonic made no attempt to cover up the orchestra’s close relationship with the third reich no doubt because the nazi ties of karajan who was its music director from  until shortly before his death in  were a matter of public record yet it was not until  that a fulllength study of its wartime activities misha aster’s the reich’s orchestra the berlin philharmonic – was finally published as for the vienna philharmonic its managers long sought to quash all discussion of the orchestra’s nazi past steadfastly refusing to open its institutional archives to scholars until  when fritz trümpi an austrian scholar was given access to its records five years later the viennese belatedly following the precedent of the berlin philharmonic added a lengthy section to their website called “the vienna philharmonic under national socialism –” in which the damning findings of trümpi and two other independent scholars were made available to the publicnow trümpi has published the political orchestra the vienna and berlin philharmonics during the third reich in which he tells how they came to terms with nazism supplying pre and postwar historical context for their transgressions written in a stiff mixture of academic jargon and translatorese the political orchestra is ungratifying to read even so the tale that it tells is both compelling and disturbing especially to anyone who clings to the belief that high art is ennobling to the spirit u nlike the vienna philharmonic which has always doubled as the pit orchestra for the vienna state opera the berlin philharmonic started life in  as a fully independent selfgoverning entity initially unsubsidized by the state it kept itself afloat by playing a grueling schedule of performances including “popular” nonsubscription concerts for which modest ticket prices were levied in addition the orchestra made records and toured internationally at a time when neither was commonthese activities made it possible for the berlin philharmonic to develop into an internationally renowned ensemble whose fabled collective virtuosity was widely seen as a symbol of german musical distinction furtwängler the orchestra’s principal conductor declared in  that the german music in which it specialized was “one of the very few things that actually contribute to elevating german prestige” hence he explained the need for state subsidy which he saw as “a matter of national prestige that is to some extent a requirement of national prudence” by then though the orchestra was already heavily subsidized by the city of berlin thus paving the way for its takeover by the nazisthe vienna philharmonic by contrast had always been subsidized founded in  when the orchestra of what was then the vienna court opera decided to give symphonic concerts on its own it performed the austrogerman classics for an elite cadre of longtime subscribers by restricting membership to local players and their pupils the orchestra cultivated what furtwängler who spent as much time conducting in vienna as in berlin described as a “homogeneous and distinct tone quality” at once dark and sweet it was as instantly identifiable—and as characteristically viennese—as the strong spicy bouquet of a gewürztraminer wineunlike the berlin philharmonic which played for whoever would pay the tab and programmed new music as a matter of policy the vienna philharmonic chose not to diversify either its hautebourgeois audience or its conservative repertoire instead it played beethoven brahms haydn mozart and schubert and later bruckner and richard strauss in vienna for the viennese starting in the ’s the orchestra’s recordings consolidated its reputation as one of the world’s foremost instrumental ensembles but its internal culture remained proudly insularwhat the two orchestras had in common was a nationalistic ethos a belief in the superiority of austrogerman musical culture that approached triumphalism one of the darkest manifestations of this ethos was their shared reluctance to hire jews the berlin philharmonic employed only four jewish players in  while the vienna philharmonic contained only  jews at the time of the anschluss none of whom was hired after  to be sure such popular jewish conductors as otto klemperer and bruno walter continued to work in vienna for as long as they could two months before the anschluss walter led and recorded a performance of the ninth symphony of gustav mahler his musical mentor and fellow jew who from  to  had been the director of the vienna court opera and one of the philharmonic’s most admired conductors but many members of both orchestras were open supporters of fascism and not a few were antisemites who ardently backed hitler by   of the  active members of the vienna philharmonic were nazi party membersthe admiration that austrogerman classical musicians had for hitler is not entirely surprising since he was a wellinformed music lover who declared in  that “germany has become the guardian of european culture and civilization” he made the support of german art music very much included a key part of his political program accordingly the berlin philharmonic was placed under the direct supervision of joseph goebbels who ensured the cooperation of its members by repeatedly raising their salaries exempting them from military service and guaranteeing their oldage pensions but there had never been any serious question of protest any more than there would be among the members of the vienna philharmonic when the nazis gobbled up austria save for the jews and one or two nonjewish players who were fired for reasons of internal politics the musicians went along unhesitatingly with hitler’s desireswith what did they go along above all they agreed to the scrubbing of jewish music from their programs and the dismissal of their jewish colleagues some jewish players managed to escape with their lives but seven of the vienna philharmonic’s  jews were either murdered by the nazis or died as a direct result of official persecution in addition both orchestras performed regularly at official government functions and made tours and other public appearances for propaganda purposes and both were treated as gems in the diadem of nazi cultureas for furtwängler the most prominent of the austrogerman orchestral conductors who served the reich his relationship to nazism continues to be debated to this day he had initially resisted the firing of the berlin philharmonic’s jewish members and protected them for as long as he could but he was also a committed if woollyminded nationalist who believed that german music had “a different meaning for us germans than for other nations” and notoriously declared in an open letter to goebbels that “we all welcome with great joy and gratitude    the restoration of our national honor” thereafter he cooperated with the nazis by all accounts uncomfortably but—it must be said—willingly a monster of egotism he saw himself as the greatest living exponent of german music and believed it to be his duty to stay behind and serve a cause higher than what he took to be mere party politics “human beings are free wherever wagner and beethoven are played and if they are not free at first they are freed while listening to these works” he naively assured a horrified arturo toscanini in  “music transports them to regions where the gestapo can do them no harm” o nce the war was over the us occupation forces decided to enlist the berlin philharmonic in the service of a democratic antisoviet germany furtwängler and herbert von karajan who succeeded him as principal conductor were officially “denazified” and their orchestra allowed to function largely undisturbed though six nazi party members were fired the vienna philharmonic received similarly privileged treatmentneedless to say there was more to this decision than cold war politics no one questioned the unique artistic stature of either orchestra moreover the vienna philharmonic precisely because of its insularity was now seen as a living museum piece a priceless repository of thcentury musical tradition still many musicians and listeners jews above all looked askance at both orchestras for years to come believing them to be tainted by nazismindeed they were so much so that they treated many of their surviving jewish exmembers in a way that can only be described as vicious in the most blatant individual case the violinist szymon goldberg who had served as the berlin philharmonic’s concertmaster under furtwängler was not allowed to reassume his post in  and was subsequently denied a pension as for the vienna philharmonic the fact that it made helmut wobisch its executive director says everything about its deepseated unwillingness to face up to its collective sinsbe that as it may scarcely any prominent musicians chose to boycott either orchestra leonard bernstein went so far as to affect a flippant attitude toward the morally equivocal conduct of the austrogerman artists whom he encountered in europe after the war upon meeting herbert von karajan in  he actually told his wife felicia that he had become “real good friends with von karajan whom you would and will adore my first nazi”at the same time though bernstein understood what he was choosing to overlook when he conducted the vienna philharmonic for the first time in  he wrote to his parentsi am enjoying vienna enormously—as much as a jew can there are so many sad memories here one deals with so many exnazis and maybe still nazis and you never know if the public that is screaming bravo for you might contain someone who  years ago might have shot me dead but it’s better to forgive and if possible forget the city is so beautiful and so full of tradition everyone here lives for music especially opera and i seem to be the new herodid bernstein sell his soul for the opportunity to work with so justly renowned an orchestra—and did he get his price by insisting that its members perform the symphonies of mahler with which he was by then closely identified it is a fair question one that does not lend itself to easy answerseven more revealing is the case of bruno walter who never forgave furtwängler for staying behind in germany informing him in an angry letter that “your art was used as a conspicuously effective means of propaganda for the regime of the devil” yet walter’s righteous anger did not stop him from conducting in vienna after the war born in berlin he had come to identify with the philharmonic so closely that it was impossible for him to seriously consider quitting its podium permanently “spiritually i was a viennese” he wrote in theme and variations his  autobiography in  he made a second recording with the vienna philharmonic of mahler’s das lied von der erde whose premiere he had conducted in  and which he had recorded in vienna  years earlier one wonders what walter who had converted to christianity but had been driven out of both his native lands for the crime of being jewish made of the text of the last movement “my friend  on this earth fortune has not been kind to me  where do i go”as for the two great orchestras of the third reich both have finally acknowledged their guilt and been forgiven at least by those who know little of their past it would occur to no one to decline on principle to perform with either group today such a gesture would surely be condemned as morally ostentatious an exercise in what we now call virtuesignaling yet it is impossible to forget what samuel lipman wrote in  in commentary apropos the wartime conduct of furtwängler “the ultimate triumph of totalitarianism i suppose it can be said is that under its sway only a martyred death can be truly moral” for the only martyrs of the berlin and vienna philharmonics were their jews the orchestras themselves live on tainted and beloved  university of chicago press

of his being fired by president trump on may  for example little green men and women known only as his “associates” began appearing in the pages of the new york times and washington post to dispute key points of the president’s account of his dismissal and to promote comey’s theory of the case“in a private dinner trump demanded loyalty” the new york times reported on may  “comey demurred” the story was a straightforward narrative of events from comey’s perspective capped with an obligatory denial from the white house the next day the washington post reported “comey associates dispute trump’s account of conversations” the post did not identify comey’s associates other than saying that they were “people who have worked with him”maybe they were the same associates who had gabbed to the times or maybe they were different ones who can tell regardless the story these particular associates gave to the post was readable and gripping comey the post reported “was wary of private meetings and discussions with the president and did not offer the assurance as trump has claimed that trump was not under investigation as part of the probe into russian interference in last year’s election”on may  michael s schmidt of the times published his scoop “comey memo says trump asked him to end flynn investigation” schmidt didn’t see the memo for himself parts of it were read to him by—you guessed it—“one of mr comey’s associates” the following day robert mueller was appointed special counsel to oversee the russia investigation on may  the times citing “two people briefed” on a call between comey and the president reported “comey unsettled by trump is said to have wanted him kept at a distance” and by the end of that week comey had agreed to testify before the senate

interview with brookings institution fellow benjamin wittes this “comey friend” said he was “very shocked” when he learned that president trump had asked comey for loyalty “i have no doubt that he regarded the group of people around the president as dishonorable” wittes saidcomey wittes added was so uncomfortable at the white house reception in january honoring law enforcement—the one where comey lumbered across the room and trump whispered something in his ear—that as cnn paraphrased it he “stood in a position so that his blue blazer would blend in with the room’s blue drapes in an effort for trump to not notice him” the integrity the courage—can you feel iton june  the day before comey’s prepared testimony was released more “associates” told abc that the director would “not corroborate trump’s claim that on three separate occasions comey told the president he was not under investigation” and a “source with knowledge of comey’s testimony” told cnn the same thing in addition abc reported that according to “a source familiar with comey’s thinking” the former director would say that trump’s actions stopped short of obstruction of justicemaybe those sources weren’t as “familiar with comey’s thinking” as they thought or hoped to maximize the press coverage he already dominated comey had authorized the senate intelligence committee to release his testimony ahead of his personal interview that testimony told a different story than what had been reported by cnn and abc and by the post on may  comey had in fact told trump the president was not under investigation—on january  january  and march  moreover the word “obstruction” did not appear at all in his written text the senators asked comey if he felt trump obstructed justice he declined to answer either waymy guess is that comey’s associates lacked comey’s scalpellike almost jesuitical ability to make distinctions and therefore misunderstood what he was telling them to say to the press because it’s obvious comey was the one behind the stories of trump’s dishonesty and bad behavior he admitted as much in front of the cameras in a remarkable exchange with senator susan collins of mainecomey said that after trump tweeted on may  that he’d better hope there aren’t “tapes” of their conversations “i asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter didn’t do it myself for a variety of reasons but i asked him to because i thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel and so i asked a close friend of mine to do it”collins asked whether that

the united states because he wanted a written record in case the president ever fired or lied about him and when the president did fire and lie about him that director set in motion a series of public disclosures with the intent of not only embarrassing the president but also forcing the appointment of a special counsel who might end up investigating the president for who knows what and none of this would have happened if the president had not fired comey or tweeted about him he told the senate that if trump hadn’t dismissed him he most likely would still be on the jobrarely in my view are high officials so transparent in describing how washington works comey revealed to the world that he was keeping a file on his boss that he used gobetweens to get his story into the press that “investigative journalism” is often just powerful people handing documents to reporters to further their careers or agendas or  even to get revenge and as long as you maintain some distance from the fallout and stick to the absolute letter of the law you will come out on top so long as you have a small army of nightingales singing to reporters on your behalf“it’s the end of the comey era” ab stoddard said on special report with bret baier the other day on the contrary i have a feeling that as the russia investigation proceeds we will be hearing much more from comey and from his

broadcasters to respond to this question is free speech under threat in the united states we received twentyseven responses we publish them here in alphabetical order the editorsfloyd abrams free expression threatened by donald trump i guess you could say sowhen a president engages in daily denigration of the press when he characterizes it as the enemy of the people  when he repeatedly says that the libel laws should be “loosened” so he can personally commence more litigation when he says that journalists shouldn’t be allowed to use confidential sources it is difficult even to suggest that he has not threatened free speech and when he says to the head of the fbi as former fbi director james comey has said that he did that comey should consider “putting reporters in jail for publishing classified information” it is difficult not to take those threats seriouslythe harder question though is this how real are the threats or as michael gerson put it in the washington post will trump “go beyond mere twitter abuse and move against institutions that limit his power” some of the president’s threats against the institution of the  press wittingly or not have been simply preposterous surely someone has told him by now that neither he nor congress can “loosen” libel laws while each state has its own libel law there is no federal libel law and thus nothing for him to loosen  what he obviously takes issue with is the impact that the supreme court’s  first amendment opinion in new york times v sullivan has had on state libel laws the case determined that public officials who sue for libel may not prevail unless they demonstrate that the statements made about them were false and were made with actual knowledge or suspicion of that falsity so his objection to the rules governing libel law is to nothing less than the application of the first amendment itselfin other areas however the trump administration has far more power to imperil free speech we live under an espionage act adopted a century ago which is both broad in its language and uncommonly vague in its meaning as such it remains a halfopen door through which an administration that is hostile to free speech might walk such an administration could initiate criminal proceedings against journalists who write about defense or intelligencerelated topics on the basis that classified information was leaked to them by present or former government employees no such action has ever been commenced against a journalist press lawyers and civilliberties advocates have strong arguments that the law may not be read so broadly and still be consistent with the first amendment but the scope of the espionage act and the impact of the first amendment upon its interpretation remain unknowna related area in which the attitude of an administration toward the press may affect the latter’s ability to function as a check on government relates to the ability of journalists to protect the identity of their confidential sources the obama administration prosecuted more espionage act cases against sources of information to journalists than all prior administrations combined after a good deal of deserved press criticism it agreed to expand the internal guidelines of the department of justice designed to limit the circumstances under which such source revelation is demanded but the guidelines are none too protective and are after all simply guidelines a new administration is free to change or limit them or in fact abandon them altogether in this area as in so many others it is too early to judge the ultimate treatment of free expression by the trump administration but the threats are real and there is good reason to be waryfloyd abrams is the author of the soul of the first amendment yale university press ayaan hirsi ali freedom of speech is being threatened in the united states by a nascent culture of hostility to different points of view as political divisions in america have deepened a conformist mentality of “right thinking” has spread across the country increasingly american universities where no intellectual doctrine ought to escape critical scrutiny are some of the most restrictive domains when it comes to asking openended questions on subjects such as islamlegally speech in the united states is protected to a degree unmatched in almost any industrialized country the us has avoided unpredictable canadianstyle restrictions on speech for example i remain optimistic that as long as we have the first amendment in the us any attempt at formal legal censorship will be vigorously challengedculturally however matters are very different in america the regressive left is the forerunner threatening free speech on any issue that is important to progressives the current pressure coming from those who call themselves “socialjustice warriors” is unlikely to lead to successful legislation to curb the first amendment instead censorship is spreading in the cultural realm particularly at institutions of higher learningthe way activists of the regressive left achieve silence or censorship is by creating a taboo and one of the most pernicious taboos in operation today is the word “islamophobia” islamists are similarly motivated to rule any critical scrutiny of islamic doctrine out of order there is now a university center funded by saudi money in the us dedicated to monitoring and denouncing incidences of “islamophobia”the term “islamophobia” is used against critics of political islam but also against progressive reformers within islam the term implies an irrational fear that is tainted by hatred and it has had a chilling effect on free speech in fact “islamophobia” is a poorly defined term islam is not a race and it is very often perfectly rational to fear some expressions of islam no set of ideas should be beyond critical scrutinyto push back in this cultural realm—in our universities in public discourse—those favoring free speech should focus more on the message of dawa the set of ideas that the islamists want to promote if the aims of dawa are sufficiently exposed ordinary americans and muslim americans will reject it the islamist message is a message of divisiveness misogyny and hatred it’s anachronistic and wants people to live by tribal norms dating from the seventh century the best antidote to islamic extremism is the revelation of what its primary objective is a society governed by sharia this is the opposite of censorship it is documenting reality what is life like in saudi arabia iran the northern nigerian states what is the true nature of sharia lawislamists want to hide the true meaning of sharia jihad and the implications for women gays religious minorities and infidels under the veil of “islamophobia” islamists use “islamophobia” to obfuscate their vision and imply that any scrutiny of political islam is hatred and bigotry the antidote to this is more exposure and more speechas pressure on freedom of speech increases from the regressive left we must reject the notions that only muslims can speak about islam and that any critical examination of islamic doctrines is inherently “racist”instead of contorting western intellectual traditions so as not to offend our muslim fellow citizens we need to defend the muslim dissidents who are risking their lives to promote the human rights we take for granted equality for women tolerance of all religions and orientations our hardwon freedoms of speech and thoughtit is by nurturing and protecting such speech that progressive reforms can emerge within islam by accepting the increasingly narrow confines of acceptable discourse on issues such as islam we do dissidents and progressive reformers within islam a grave disservice for truly progressive reforms within islam to be possible full freedom of speech will be requiredayaan hirsi ali is a research fellow at the hoover institution stanford university and the founder of the aha foundation lee c bollinger i know it is too much to expect that political discourse mimic the measured selfquestioning rational footnoting standards of the academy but there is a difference between robust political debate and political debate infected with fear or panic the latter introduces a state of mind that is visceral and irrational in the realm of fear we move beyond the reach of reason and a sense of proportionality when we fear we lose the capacity to listen and can become insensitive and meanour constitution is well aware of this fact about the human mind and of its negative political consequences in the first amendment jurisprudence established over the past century we find many expressions of the problematic state of mind that is produced by fear  among the most famous and potent is that of justice brandeis in whitney v california in  one of the many cases involving aggravated fears of subversive threats from abroad “it is the function of free speech” he said “to free men from the bondage of irrational fears”  “men feared witches” brandeis continued “and burned women”today our “witches” are terrorists and brandeis’s metaphorical “women” include the refugees mostly children and displaced persons immigrants and foreigners whose lives have been thrown into suspension and doubt by policies of exclusionthe same fears of the foreign that take hold of a population inevitably infect our internal interactions and institutions yielding suppression of unpopular and dissenting voices victimization of vulnerable groups attacks on the media and the rise of demagoguery with its disdain for facts reason expertise and toleranceall of this poses a very special obligation on those of us within universities  not only must we make the case in every venue for the values that form the core of who we are and what we do but we must also live up to our own principles of free inquiry and fearless engagement with all ideas  this is why recent incidents on a handful of college campuses disrupting and effectively censoring speakers is so alarming  such acts not only betray a basic principle but also inflame a rising prejudice against the academic community and they feed efforts to delegitimize our work at the very moment when it’s most neededi do not for a second support the view that this generation has an unhealthy aversion to engaging differences of opinion that is a modern trope of polarization as is the portrayal of universities as hypocritical about academic freedom and political correctness but now in this environment especially universities must be at the forefront of defending the rights of all students and faculty to listen to controversial voices to engage disagreeable viewpoints and to make every effort to demonstrate our commitment to the sort of fearless and spirited debate that we are simultaneously asking of the larger society anyone with a voice can shout over a speaker but being able to listen to and then effectively rebut those with whom we disagree—particularly those who themselves peddle intolerance—is one of the greatest skills our education can bestow  and it is something our democracy desperately needs more of that is why i say to you now if speakers who are being denied access to other campuses come here i will personally volunteer to introduce them and listen to them however much i may disagree with them but i will also never hesitate to make clear why i disagree with themlee c bollinger is the th president of columbia university and the author of uninhibited robust and wideopen a free press for a new century this piece has been excerpted from president bollinger’s may  commencement addressrichard a epsteintoday the greatest threat to the constitutional protection of freedom of speech comes from campus rabblerousers who invoke this very protection in their book the speech of people like charles murray and heather mac donald constitutes a form of violence bordering on genocide that receives no first amendment protection enlightened protestors are both bound and entitled to shout them down by force or other disruptive actions if their universities are so foolish as to extend them an invitation to speak any indignant minority may take the law into its own hands to eradicate the intellectual cancer before it spreads on their own campusby such tortured logic a new generation of vigilantes distorts the first amendment doctrine speech becomes violence and violence becomes heroic acts of selfdefense the standard first amendment interpretation emphatically rejects that view of course the first amendment doesn’t let you say what you want when and wherever you want to your freedom of speech is subject to the same limitations as your freedom of action so you have no constitutional license to assault other people to lie to them or to form cartels to bilk them in the marketplace but folks such as murray mac donald and even yiannopoulos do not come close to crossing into that forbidden territory they are not using for example “fighting words” rightly limited to words or actions calculated to provoke immediate aggression against a known target fighting words are worlds apart from speech that provokes a negative reaction in those who find your speech offensive solely because of the content of its messagethis distinction is central to the first amendment fighting words have to be blocked by welltailored criminal and civil sanctions lest some people gain license to intimidate others from speaking or peaceably assembling the remedy for mere offense is to speak one’s mind in response but it never gives anyone the right to block the speech of others lest everyone be able to unilaterally increase his sphere of action by getting really angry about the beliefs of others no one has the right to silence others by working himself into a fit of rageobviously it is intolerable to let mutual animosity generate factional warfare whereby everyone can use force to silence rivals to avoid this war of all against all each side claims that only its actions are privileged these selective claims quickly degenerate into a form of viewpoint discrimination which undermines one of the central protections that traditional first amendment law erects a wall against each and every group out to destroy the level playing field on which robust political debate rests every group should be at risk for having its message fall flat the new campus radicals want to upend that understanding by shutting down their adversaries if their universities do not their aggression must be met if necessary by counterforce silence in the face of aggression is not an acceptable alternativerichard a epstein is the laurence a tisch professor of law at the new york university school of lawdavid french we’re living in the midst of a troubling paradox at the exact same time that first amendment jurisprudence has arguably never been stronger and more protective of free expression millions of americans feel they simply can’t speak freely indeed talk to americans living and working in the deepblue confines of the academy hollywood and the tech sector and you’ll get a sense of palpable fear they’ll explain that they can’t say what they think and keep their jobs their friends and sometimes even their familiesthe government isn’t cracking down or censoring instead americans are using free speech to destroy free speech for example a socialmedia shaming campaign is an act of free speech so is an economic boycott so is turning one’s back on a public speaker so is a private corporation firing a dissenting employee for purely political reasons each of these actions is largely protected from government interference and each one represents an expression of the speaker’s ideas and valuesthe problem however is obvious the goal of each of these kinds of actions isn’t to persuade it’s to intimidate the goal isn’t to foster dialogue but to coerce conformity the result is a marketplace of ideas that has been emptied of all but the approved ideological vendors—at least in those communities that are dominated by online thugs and corporate bullies indeed this mindset has become so prevalent that in places such as portland berkeley middlebury and elsewhere the bullies and thugs have crossed the line from protected—albeit abusive—speech into outright shoutdowns and mob violencebut there’s something else going on something that’s insidious in its own way while politically correct shaming still has great power in deepblue america its effect in the rest of the country is to trigger a furious backlash one characterized less by a desire for dialogue and discourse than by its own rage and scorn so we’re moving toward two americas—one that ruthlessly and occasionally illegally suppresses dissenting speech and the other that is dangerously close to believing that the opposite of political correctness isn’t a fearless expression of truth but rather the fearless expression of ideas best calculated to enrage your opponentsthe result is a partisan feedback loop where rightwing rage spurs leftwing censorship which spurs even more rightwing rage for one side a true freespeech culture is a threat to feelings sensitivities and social justice the other side waves high the banner of “free speech” to sometimes elevate the worst voices to the highest platforms—not so much to protect the first amendment as to infuriate the hated “snowflakes” and trigger the most hysterical overreactionsthe culturally sustainable argument for free speech is something else entirely it reminds the cultural left of its own debt to free speech while reminding the political right that a movement allegedly centered around constitutional values can’t abandon the concept of ordered liberty the culture of free speech thrives when all sides remember their moral responsibilities—to both protect the right of dissent and to engage in ideological combat with a measure of grace and humilitydavid french is a senior writer at national reviewpamela geller the real question isn’t whether free speech is under threat in the united states but rather whether it’s irretrievably lost can we get it back not without war i suspect as is evidenced by the violence at colleges whenever there’s the shamefully rare event of a conservative speaker on campusfree speech is the soul of our nation and the foundation of all our other freedoms if we can’t speak out against injustice and evil those forces will prevail freedom of speech is the foundation of a free society without it a tyrant can wreak havoc unopposed while his opponents are silencedwith that principle in mind i organized a freespeech event in garland texas the world had recently been rocked by the murder of the charlie hebdo cartoonists my version of “je suis charlie” was an event here in america to show that we can still speak freely and draw whatever we like in the land of the free yet even after jihadists attacked our event i was blamed—by donald trump among others—for provoking muslims and if i tried to hold a similar event now no arena in the country would allow me to do so—not just because of the security risk but because of the moral cowardice of all intellectual appeasersunder what law is it wrong to depict muhammad under islamic law but i am not a muslim i don’t live under sharia america isn’t under islamic law yet for standing for free speech i’ve beenprevented from running our advertisements in every major city in this country we have won freespeech lawsuits all over the country which officials circumvent by prohibiting all political ads while making exceptions for ads from muslim advocacy groupsshunned by the right shut out of the conservative political action conferenceshunned by jewish groups at the behest of terrorlinked groups such as the council on americanislamic relationsblacklisted from speaking at universitiesprevented from publishing books for security reasons and because publishers fear shaming from the leftbanned from britaina seattle court accused me of trying to shut down free speech after we merely tried to run an fbi poster on global terrorism because authorities had banned all political ads in other cities to avoid running ours seattle blamed us for that which was like blaming a woman for being raped because she was wearing a short skirtthis kind of vilification and shunning is key to the left’s plan to shut down all dissent from its agenda—they make legislation restricting speech unnecessarythe same refusal to allow our point of view to be heard has manifested itself elsewhere the foundation of my work is individual rights and equality for all before the law these are the foundational principles of our constitutional republic that is now considered controversial truth is the new hate speech truth is going to be criminalizedthe first amendment doesn’t only protect ideas that are sanctioned by the cultural and political elites if “hate speech” laws are enacted who would decide what’s permissible and what’s forbidden the government the gunmen in garlandthere has been an inversion of the founding premise of this nation no longer is it the subordination of might to right but right to might history is repeatedly deformed with the bloody consequences of this transitionpamela geller is the editor in chief of the geller report and president of the american freedom defense initiativejonah goldberg of course free speech is under threat in america frankly it’s always under threat in america because it’s always under threat everywhere ronald reagan was right when he said in  “freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction we didn’t pass it on to our children in the bloodstream it must be fought for protected and handed on for them to do the same”this is more than political boilerplate reagan identified the source of the threat human nature god may have endowed us with a right to liberty but he didn’t give us all a taste for it as with most finer things we must work to acquire a taste for it that is what civilization—or at least our civilization—is supposed to do cultivate attachments to certain ideals “cultivate” shares the same latin root as “culture” cultus and properly understood they mean the same thing to grow nurture and sustain through laborin the past threats to free speech have taken many forms—nationalist passion comstockery both good and bad political suppression etc—but the threat to free speech today is different it is less topdown and more bottomup we are cultivating a generation of young people to reject free speech as an important valueone could mark the beginning of the selfesteem movement with nathaniel branden’s  paper “the psychology of selfesteem” which claimed that “feelings of selfesteem were the key to success in life” this understandable idea ran amok in our schools and in our culture when i was a kid saturdaymorning cartoons were punctuated with publicservice announcements telling kids “the most important person in the whole wide world is you and you hardly even know you”the selfesteem craze was just part of the cocktail of educational fads other ingredients included multiculturalism the antibullying crusade and of course that broad phenomenon known as “political correctness” combined they’ve produced a generation that rejects the old adage “sticks and stones can break my bones but words can never harm me” in favor of the notion that “words hurt” what we call political correctness has been on college campuses for decades but it lacked a critical mass of young people who were sufficiently receptive to it to make it a fully successful ideology the campus commissars welcomed the new “snowflakes” with open arms truly these are the ones we’ve been waiting for“words hurt” is a fashionable concept in psychology today see psychology today “why words can hurt at least as much as sticks and stones” but it’s actually a much older idea than the “sticks and stones” aphorism for most of human history it was a crime to say insulting or “injurious” things about aristocrats rulers the church etc that tendency didn’t evaporate with the divine right of kings jonathan haidt has written at book length about our natural capacity to create zones of sanctity immune from reasonand that is the threat free speech faces today those who inveigh against “hate speech” are in reality fighting “heresy speech”—ideas that do “violence” to sacred notions of selfesteem racial or gender equality climate change and so on put whatever label you want on it contemporary “social justice” progressivism acts as a religion and it has no patience for blasphemywhen napoleon’s forces converted churches into stables the clergy did not object on the grounds that regulations regarding the proper care and feeding of animals had been violated they complained of sacrilege and blasphemy when charles murray or christina hoff summers visits college campuses the protestors are behaving like the zealous acolytes of st jerome appeals to the first amendment have as much power over the “antifa” fanatics as appeals to odin did to champions of the new faiththat is the real threat to free speech todayjonah goldberg is a senior editor at national review and a fellow at the american enterprise institutekc johnson in early may the washington post urged universities to make clear that “racist signs symbols and speech are offlimits” given the extraordinarily broad definition of what constitutes “racist” speech at most institutions of higher education this demand would single out most rightofcenter and in some cases even centrist and liberal discourse on issues of race or ethnicity the editorial provided the highestprofile example of how hostility to free speech once confined to the ideological fringe on campus has migrated to the liberal mainstreamthe last few years have seen periodic college protests—featuring claims that significant amounts of political speech constitute “violence” thereby justifying censorship—followed by even more troubling attempts to appease the protesters after the mob scene that greeted charles murray upon his visit to middlebury college for instance the student government criticized any punishment for the protesters and several student leaders wanted to require that future speakers conform to the college’s “community standard” on issues of race gender and ethnicity in the last few months similar attempts to stifle the free exchange of ideas in the name of promoting diversity occurred at wesleyan claremont mckenna and duke offering an extreme interpretation of this point of view one cuny professor recently dismissed dialogue as “inherently conservative” since it reinforced the “relations of power that presently exist”it’s easy of course to dismiss campus hostility to free speech as affecting only a small segment of american public life—albeit one that trains the next generation of judges legislators and voters but as jonathan chait observed in  denying “the legitimacy of political pluralism on issues of race and gender” has broad appeal on the left it is only most apparent on campus because “the academy is one of the few bastions of american life where the political left can muster the strength to impose its political hegemony upon others” during his time in office barack obama generally urged fellow liberals to support open intellectual debate but the current campus environment previews the position of free speech in a postobama democratic party increasingly oriented around identity politicswaning support on one end of the ideological spectrum for this bedrock american principle should provide a political opening for the other side the trump administration however seems poorly suited to make the case throughout his public career trump has rarely supported free speech even in the abstract and has periodically embraced legal changes to facilitate libel lawsuits moreover the rightwing populism that motivates trump’s base has a long tradition of ideological hostility to civil liberties of all types even in campus contexts conservatives have defended free speech inconsistently as seen in recent calls that cuny disinvite antizionist fanatic linda sarsour as a commencement speakerin a sharply polarized political environment awash in dubiouslysourced information free speech is all the more important yet this same environment has seen both sides most blatantly elements of the left on campuses demand restrictions on their ideological foes’ free speech in the name of promoting a greater goodkc johnson is a professor of history at brooklyn college and the cuny graduate centerlaura kipnis i find myself with a strangebedfellows problem lately here i am a leftwing feminist professor invited onto the pages of commentary—though i’d be thrilled if it were still —while fielding speaking requests from rightwing think tanks and libertarians who oppose childlabor lawssomehow i’ve ended up in the middle of the freespeechoncampus debate my initial crime was publishing a somewhat contentious essay about campus sexual paranoia that put me on the receiving end of title ix complaints apparently i’d created a “hostile environment” at my university i was investigated for  days then i wrote up what i’d learned about these campus inquisitions in a second essay then i wrote about it all some more in a book exposing the kangaroocourt elements of the title ix process—and the extralegal gag orders imposed on everyone caught in its widening snarei can’t really comment on whether more charges have been filed against me over the book i’ll just say that writing about being a title ix respondent could easily become a life’s work i learned shortly after writing this piece that i and my publisher were being sued for defamation among other thingsis free speech under threat on american campuses yes we know all about student activists who wish to shut down talks by people with opposing views i got smeared with a bit of that myself after a speaking invitation at wellesley—some students made a video protesting my visit before i arrived the talk went fine though a group of concerned faculty circulated an open letter afterward also protesting the invitation my views on sexual politics were too heretical and might have offended studentsi didn’t take any of this too seriously even as rightwing pundits crowed with wellesley as their latest outrage bait it was another opportunity to mock student activists and the fact that i was myself a feminist rather than a charles murray or a milo yiannopoulos made them positively gleefuli do find myself wondering where all my new freespeech pals were when another leftwing professor steven salaita was fired or if you prefer euphemism “his job offer was withdrawn” from the university of illinois after he tweeted criticism of israel’s gaza policy sure the tweets were hyperbolic but hyperbole and strong opinions are protected speech tooi guess free speech is easy to celebrate until it actually challenges something funny i haven’t seen milo around lately—so beloved by my new friends when he was bashing minorities and transgender kids then he mistakenly said something authentic who knew he was capable of it reminiscing about an experience a lot of gay men have shared teenage sex with older men he tried walking it back—no no he’d been a victim not a participant—but his fan base was shrieking about pedophilia and fleeing in droves gee they were all so against “political correctness” a few minutes beforeit’s easy to be a freespeech fan when your feathers aren’t being ruffled no doubt what makes me palatable to the antipc crowd is having thus far failed to ruffle them enough i’m just going to have to work harderlaura kipnis’s latest book is unwanted advances sexual paranoia comes to campuseugene kontorovich the free and open exchange of views—especially politically conservative or traditionally religious ones—is being challenged this is taking place not just at college campuses but throughout our public spaces and cultural institutions james watson was fired from the lab he led since  and could not speak at new york university because of petty censorious students who would not know dna from lsd our nation’s founders and heroes are being “disappeared” from public commemoration like trotsky from a photograph of soviet rulersthese attacks on “free speech” are not the result of government action they are not what the first amendment protects against the current methods—professional and social shaming exclusion and employment termination—are more inchoate and their effects are multiplied by selfcensorship a young conservative legal scholar might find himself thinking “if the late justice antonin scalia can posthumously be deemed a ‘bigot’ by many academics what chance have i”ironically artists and intellectuals have long prided themselves on being the first defenders of free speech today it is the institutions of both popular and high culture that are the censors is there one poet in the country who would speak out for ann coulterthe inhibition of speech at universities is part of a broader social phenomenon of making longstanding traditional views and practices sinful overnight conservatives have not put up much resistance to this to paraphrase martin niemöller’s famous dictum “first they came for robert e lee and i said nothing because robert e lee meant nothing to me”the situation with respect to israel and expressions of support for it deserves separate discussion even as university administrators give political power to favored ideologies by letting them create “safe spaces” safe from opposing views jews find themselves and their state at the receiving end of claims of apartheid—modern day blood libels it is not surprising if jewish students react by demanding that they get a safe space of their own it is even less surprising if their parents paying  a year want their children to have a nicer time of it one hears jewish groups frequently express concern about jewish students feeling increasingly isolated and uncomfortable on campusbut demanding selective protection from the new ideological commissars is unlikely to bring the desired results first this new ideology even if it can be harnessed momentarily to give respite to harassed jews on campus is ultimately illiberal and will be controlled by “progressive” forces second it is not so terrible for jews in the diaspora to feel a bit uncomfortable it has been the common condition of jews throughout the millennia the social awkwardness that jews at liberal arts schools might feel in being associated with israel is of course one of the primary justifications for the jewish state facing the snowflakes incapable of hearing a dissonant view—but who nonetheless in the grip of intersectional ecstasy revile jewish selfdetermination—jewish students should toughen upeugene kontorovich teaches constitutional law at northwestern university and heads the international law department of the kohelet policy forum in jerusalemnicholas lemann there’s an old tom wolfe essay in which he describes being on a panel discussion at princeton in  and provoking the other panelists by announcing that america rather than being in crisis is in the middle of a “happiness explosion” he was arguing that the mass effects of  years of post–world war ii prosperity made for a larger phenomenon than the vietnam war the racial crisis and the other primary concerns of intellectuals at the timein the same spirit i’d say that we are in the middle of a freespeech explosion because of plus years of the internet and plus years of social media if one understands speech as disseminated individual opinion then surely we live in the freespeechest society in the history of the world anybody with access to the unimpeded world wide web can say anything to a global audience and anybody can hear anything too all threats to free speech should be understood in the context of this overwhelmingly realityit is a comforting fantasy that a genuine freespeech regime will empower mainly “good” but previously repressed speech conversely repressive regimes that are candid enough to explain their antifreespeech policies usually say that they’re not against free speech just “bad” speech we have to accept that more free speech probably means in the aggregate more bad speech and also a weakening of the power authority and economic support for information professionals such as journalists welcome to the united states in i am lucky enough to live and work on the campus of a university columbia that has been blessedly free of successful attempts to repress free speech just in the last few weeks charles murray and dinesh d’souza have spoken here without incident but yes the evidently growing popularity of the idea that “hate speech” shouldn’t be permitted on campuses is a problem especially it seems at small private liberalarts colleges we should all do our part and i do by frequently and publicly endorsing freespeech principles opposing the bds movement falls squarely into that categoryit’s not just on campuses that freespeech vigilance is needed though the numberone threat to free speech to my mind is that the wideopen web has been replaced by privately owned platforms such as facebook and google as the way most people experience the public life of the internet these companies are committed to banning “hate speech” and they are eager to operate freely in countries like china that don’t permit free political speech that makes for a far more consequential constrained environment than any campus’s speech codealso donald trump regularly engages in presidentially unprecedented rhetoric demonizing people who disagree with him he seems to think this is all in good fun but as we have already seen at his rallies not everybody hears it that way the place where trumpism will endanger free speech isn’t in the center—the white house press room—but at the periphery for example in the way that local police handle bumptious protestors and the journalists covering them this is already happening around the country if trump were as disciplined and knowledgeable as vladimir putin or recep tayyip erdogan which so far he seems not to be then free speech could be in even more serious danger from government which in most places is its usual main enemynicholas lemann is a professor at columbia journalism school and a staff writer for the new yorkermichael j lewis free speech is a right but it is also a habit and where the habit shrivels so will the right if free speech today is in headlong retreat—everywhere threatened by regulation organized harassment and even violence—it is in part because our political culture allowed the practice of persuasive oratory to atrophy the process began in  an unforeseen side effect of roe v wade legislators were delighted to learn that by relegating this divisive matter of public policy to the supreme court and adopting a merely symbolic position they could sit all the more safely in their safe seatssince then one crucial question of public policy after another has been punted out of the realm of politics and into the judicial issues that might have been debated with all the rhetorical agility of a lincoln and a douglas and then subjected to a process of negotiation compromise and voting have instead been settled by decree eg chevron kelo obergefell the consequences for speech have been pernicious since the time of pericles deliberative democracy has been predicated on the art of persuasion which demands the forceful clarity of thought and expression without which no one has ever been persuaded but a legislature that relegates its authority to judges and regulators will awaken to discover its oratorical culture has been stunted when politicians rather than seeking to convince and win over prefer to project a studied and pleasant vagueness debate withers into tedious defensive performance it has been decades since any presidential debate has seen any sustained give and take over a matter of policy if there is any suspense at all it is only the possibility that a fatigued or peeved candidate might blurt out that tactless shard of truth known as a gaffea generation accustomed to hearing platitudes smoothly dispensed from behind a teleprompter will find the speech of a fearless extemporaneous speaker to be startling even disquieting unfamiliar ideas always are unhappily they have been taught to interpret that disquiet as an injury done to them rather than as a premise offered to them to consider all this would not have happened—certainly not to this extent—had not our deliberative democracy decided a generation ago that it preferred the security of incumbency to the risks of unshackled debate the compulsory contraction of free speech on college campuses is but the logical extension of the voluntary contraction of free speech in our political culturemichael j lewis’s new book is city of refuge separatists and utopian town planning princeton university pressheather mac donald the answer to the symposium question depends on how powerful the transmission belt is between academia and the rest of the country on college campuses violence and brute force are silencing speakers who challenge leftwing campus orthodoxies these totalitarian outbreaks have been met with listless denunciations by college presidents followed by    virtually nothing as of midmay the only discipline imposed for ’s mass attacks on free speech at uc berkeley middlebury and claremont mckenna college was a letter of reprimand inserted—sometimes only temporarily—into the files of several dozen middlebury students accompanied by a brief period of probation

supporters were suckerpunched and maced businesses downtown were torched and vandalized new york university’s vice provost for faculty arts humanities and diversity ulrich baer displayed orwellian logic by claiming in a new york times oped that shutting down speech “should be understood as an attempt to ensure the conditions of free speech for a greater group of people”will nonacademic institutions take up this zeal for outright censorship other ideological products of the leftwing academy have been fully absorbed and operationalized racial victimology which drives much of the campus censorship is now standard in government and business corporate diversity trainers counsel that bias is responsible for any lack of proportional racial representation in the corporate ranks  racial disparities in school discipline and incarceration are universally attributed to racism rather than to behavior public figures have lost jobs for violating politically correct taboosyet americans possess an instinctive commitment to the first amendment federal judges hardly an extension of the federalist society have overwhelmingly struck down campus speech codes it is hard to imagine that they would be any more tolerant of the hatespeech legislation so prevalent in europe so the question becomes at what point does the pressure to conform to the elite worldview curtail freedom of thought and expression even without explicit bans on speechsocial stigma against conservative viewpoints is not the same as actual censorship but the line can blur the obama administration used regulatory power to impose a behavioral conformity on public and private entities school administrators may have technically still possessed the right to dissent from novel theories of gender but they had to behave as if they were fully on board with the transgender revolution when it came to allowing boys to use girls’ bathrooms and locker roomshad hillary clinton had been elected president the federal bureaucracy would have mimicked campus diversocrats with even greater zeal that threat at least has been avoided heresies against leftwing dogma may still enter the public arena if only by the back door the mainstream media have lurched even further left in the trump era but the conservative media however mocked and marginalized are expanding though twitter and facebook’s censorship of conservative speakers could be a harbinger of more official silencingoutside the academy free speech is still legally protected but its exercise requires ever greater determinationheather mac donald is a fellow at the manhattan institute and the author of the war on copsjohn mcwhorter there is a certain mendacity as brick put it in cat on a hot tin roof in our discussion of free speech on college campuses namely none of us genuinely wish that absolutely all issues be aired in the name of education and openmindedness to insist so is to pretend that civilized humanity makes nothing we could call advancement in philosophical consensusi doubt we need “free speech” on issues such as whether slavery and genocide are okay whether it has been a mistake to view women as men’s equals or to banish as antique the idea that whites are a master race while other peoples represent a lower rung on the darwinian scale with all due reverence of john stuart mill’s advocacy for the regular airing of even noxious views in order to reinforce clarity on why they were rejected we are also human beings with limited time a commitment to the enlightenment justifiably will decree that certain views are indeed no longer in need of discussionhowever our modern socialjustice warriors are claiming that this nofly zone of discussion is vaster than any conception of logic or morality justifies we are being told that questions regarding the modern proposals about cultural appropriation about whether even passing infelicitous statements constitute racism in the way that formalized segregation and racist disparagement did or about whether social disparities can be due to cultural legacies rather than structural impediments are as indisputably egregious backwards and abusive as the benighted views of the increasingly distant pastthat is the new idea is not only that discrimination and inequality still exist but that to even question the left’s utopian expectation on such matters justifies the same furious sloganistic and even physically violent resistance that was once levelled against those designated heretics by a christian hegemonyof course the protesters in question do not recognize themselves in a portrait as opponents of something called heresy they suppose that galileo’s opponents were clearly wrong but that they today are actually correct in a way that no intellectual or moral argument could coherently denyas such we have students allowed to decree college campuses as “racist” when they are the least racist spaces on the planet—because they are predictably given the imperfection of humans not perfectly free of passingly unsavory interactions thinkers invited to talk for a portion of an hour from the right rather than the left and then have dinner with a few people and fly home are treated as if they were reanimated hitlers the student of color who hears a few white students venturing polite questions about the leftist orthodoxy is supported in fashioning these questions as “racist” rhetoricthe people on college campuses who openly and aggressively spout this new version of christian or even islamist crusading—ironically justifying it as a barricade against “fascist” muzzling of freedom when the term applies ominously well to the regime they are fostering—are a minority however the sawmill spinning blade of their rhetoric has succeeding in rendering opposition as risky as espousing pedophilia such that only those natively open to violent criticism dare speak out the latter group is small the campus consensus thereby becomes if only at moralistic gunpoint à la the isis victim video a strangled hardleftismhence freedom of speech is indeed threatened on today’s college campuses i have lost count of how many of my students despite being liberal democrats many of whom sobbed at hillary clinton’s loss last november have told me that they are afraid to express their opinions about issues that matter despite the fact that their opinions are ones that any liberal or even leftist person circa  would have considered perfectly acceptablesomething has shifted of late and not in a direction we can legitimately consider forwardsjohn mcwhorter teaches linguistics philosophy and music history at columbia university and is the author of the language hoax words on the move and  talking back talking black kate bachelder

gas and after apprehending dozens of protesters enforce a  am curfew anyone roaming the streets after hours is subject to arrest about  national guardsmen are prepared to intervene such violence and disorder is also roiling berkeley and other elite and educated areasoh that’s  the details are from the harvard crimson’s account of “antiwar” riots that spring the episode is instructive in considering whether free speech is under threat in the united states almost daily there’s a new youtube installment of students melting down over viewpoints of speakers invited to one campus or another even amid speech threats from government—for example the irs’s targeting of political opponents—nothing has captured the public’s attention like the end of free expression at america’s institutions of higher learningyet disruption confusion and even violence are not new campus phenomena and it’s hard to imagine that young adults who deployed brute force in the s and ’s were deeply committed to the open and peaceful exchange of ideasthere may also be reason for optimism the rough and tumble on campus in the s and ’s produced a more eventempered ’s and ’s and colleges are probably heading for another course correction in covering the ruckuses at yale missouri and elsewhere i’ve talked to professors and students who are figuring out how to respond to the illiberalism even if the reaction is delayed the university of chicago put out a set of freespeech principles last year and others schools such as princeton and purdue have endorsed themthe narps—nonathletic regular people as they are sometimes known on campus—still outnumber the socialjustice warriors who appear to be overplaying their hand case in point is the university of missouri which experienced a precipitous drop in enrollment after instructor melissa click and her ilk stoked racial tensions last spring the college has closed dorms and trimmed budgets which brings us to another silver lining the economic model of higher education exorbitant tuition to pay ever more administrators may blow up traditional college before the fascists cannote also that the antispeech movement is run by rich kids a brookings institution analysis from earlier this year discovered that “the average enrollee at a college where students have attempted to restrict free speech comes from a family with an annual income  higher than that of the average student in america” few rank higher in average income than those at middlebury college where students evicted scholar charles murray in a particularly ugly scene the report notes that murray was received respectfully at saint louis university “where the median income of students’ families is half middlebury’s” the impulses of overadulated yearolds may soon be tempered by the tyranny of having to show up for work on a daily basisnone of this is to suggest that free speech is enjoying some renaissance either on campus or in america but perhaps as the late wall street journal editorialpage editor robert bartley put it in his valedictory address “things could be worse indeed they have been worse”kate bachelder odell is an editorial writer for the wall street journaljonathan rauch is free speech under threat the onesyllable answer is “yes” the threesyllable answer is “yes of course” free speech is always under threat because it is not only the single most successful social idea in all of human history it is also the single most counterintuitive “you mean to say that speech that is offensive untruthful malicious seditious antisocial blasphemous heretical misguided or all of the above deserves government protection” that seemingly bizarre proposition is defensible only on the grounds that the marketplace of ideas turns out to be the most powerful engine of knowledge prosperity liberty social peace and moral advancement that our species has had the good fortune to discoverevery new generation of freespeech advocates will need to get up every morning and reexplain the case for free speech and open inquiry—today tomorrow and forever that is our lot in life and we just need to be cheerful about it at discouraging moments it is helpful to remember that the country has made great strides toward free speech since  when the adams administration arrested and jailed its political critics and since the s when the us government banned and burned james joyce’s great novel ulysses and since  when the government banned one a pioneering gay journal the cover article was a critique of the government’s indecency censors who censored it none of those things could happen todayi suppose then the interesting question is what kind of threat is free speech under today in the present age direct censorship by government bodies is rare instead two more subtle challenges hold sway especially although not only on college campuses the first is a version of what i called in my book kindly inquisitors the humanitarian challenge the idea that speech that is hateful or hurtful in someone’s estimation causes pain and thus violates others’ rights much as physical violence does the other is a version of what i called the egalitarian challenge the idea that speech that denigrates minorities again in someone’s estimation perpetuates social inequality and oppression and thus also is a rights violation both arguments call upon administrators and other bureaucrats to defend human rights by regulating speech rightsboth doctrines are flawed to the core censorship harms minorities by enforcing conformity and entrenching majority power and it no more ameliorates hatred and injustice than smashing thermometers ameliorates global warming if unwelcome words are the equivalent of bludgeons or bullets then the free exchange of criticism—science in other words—is a crime i could go on but suffice it to say that the current challenges are new variations on ancient themes—and they will be followed in decades and centuries to come by many many other variations memo to freespeech advocates our work is never done but the really amazing thing given the proposition we are tasked to defend is how well we are doingjonathan rauch is a senior fellow at the brookings institution and the author of kindly inquisitors the new attacks on free thoughtnicholas quinn rosenkranz speech is under threat on american campuses as never before censorship in various forms is on the rise and this year the threat to free speech on campus took an even darker turn toward actual violence the prospect of milo yiannopoulos speaking at berkeley provoked riots that caused more than  worth of property damage on the campus the prospect of charles murray speaking at middlebury led to a riot that put a liberal professor in the hospital with a concussion ann coulter’s speech at berkeley was cancelled after the university determined that none of the appropriate venues could be protected from “known security threats” on the date in questionthe freespeech crisis on campus is caused at least in part by a more insidious campus pathology the almost complete lack of intellectual diversity on elite university faculties at yale for example the number of registered republicans in the economics department is zero in the psychology department there is one overall there are  faculty members at yale and the total number of those who donated to a republican candidate during the  primaries was threeso when today’s students purport to feel “unsafe” at the mere prospect of a conservative speaker on campus it may be easy to mock them as “delicate snowflakes” but in one sense their reaction is understandable if students are shocked at the prospect of a republican behind a university podium perhaps it is because many of them have never before laid eyes on oneto see the connection between free speech and intellectual diversity consider the recent commencement speech of harvard president drew gilpin faustuniversities must be places open to the kind of debate that can change ideas…silencing ideas or basking in intellectual orthodoxy independent of facts and evidence impedes our access to new and better ideas and it inhibits a full and considered rejection of bad ones    we must work to ensure that universities do not become bubbles isolated from the concerns and discourse of the society that surrounds them universities must model a commitment to the notion that truth cannot simply be claimed but must be established—established through reasoned argument assessment and even sometimes uncomfortable challenges that provide the foundation for truthfaust is exactly right but alas her commencement audience might be forgiven a certain skepticism after all the number of registered republicans in several departments at harvard—eg history and psychology—is exactly zero in those departments the professors themselves may be “basking in intellectual orthodoxy” without ever facing “uncomfortable challenges” this may help explain why some students will do everything in their power to keep conservative speakers off campus they notice that faculty hiring committees seem to do exactly the same thingin short it is a promising sign that true liberal academics like faust have started speaking eloquently about the crucial importance of civil reasoned disagreement but they will be more convincing on this point when they hire a few colleagues with whom they actually disagreenicholas quinn rosenkranz is a professor of law at georgetown he serves on the executive committee of heterodox academy which he cofounded on the board of directors of the federalist society and on the board of directors of the foundation for individual rights in education fireben shapiro in february i spoke at california state university in los angeles before my arrival professors informed students that a white supremacist would be descending on the school to preach hate threats of violence soon prompted the administration to cancel the event i vowed to show up anyway one hour before the event the administration backed down and promised to guarantee that the event could go forward but police officers were told not to stop the  students faculty and outside protesters who blocked and assaulted those who attempted to attend the lecture we ended up trapped in the auditorium with the authorities telling students not to leave for fear of physical violence i was rushed from campus under armed police guardis free speech under assaultof course it ison campus free speech is under assault thanks to a perverse ideology of intersectionality that claims victim identity is of primary value and that views are a merely secondary concern as a corollary if your views offend someone who outranks you on the intersectional hierarchy your views are treated as violence—threats to identity itself on campus statements that offend an individual’s identity have been treated as “microaggressions”–actual aggressions against another ostensibly worthy of violence words students have been told may not break bones but they will prompt sticks and stones and rightly sothus protesters around the country—leftists who see verbiage as violence—have in turn used violence in response to ideas they hate leftist local authorities then use the threat of violence as an excuse to ideologically discriminate against conservatives this means public intellectuals like charles murray being run off of campus and his leftist professorial cohort viciously assaulted it means ann coulter being targeted for violence at berkeley it means universities preemptively banning me and ayaan hirsi ali and condoleezza rice and even jason rileythe campus attacks on free speech are merely the most extreme iteration of an ideology that spans from left to right the notion that your right to free speech ends where my feelings begin even democrats who say that ann coulter should be allowed to speak at berkeley say that nobody should be allowed to contribute to a super pac unless you’re a union member naturallymeanwhile on the right the president’s attacks on the press have convinced many republicans that restrictions on the press wouldn’t be altogether bad a vanity fair minutes poll in late april found that  percent of americans thought freedom of the press “does more harm than good” undoubtedly some of that is due to the media’s obvious bias cnn’s jeff zucker has targeted the trump administration for supposedly quashing journalism but he was silent when the obama administration’s department of justice cracked down on reporters from the associated press and fox news and when hacks like deputy national security adviser ben rhodes openly sold lies regarding iran but for some on the right the response to press falsities hasn’t been to call for truth but to instead echo trumpian falsehoods in the hopes of damaging the media free speech is only important when people seek the truth leftists traded truth for tribalism long ago in response many on the right seem willing to do the same until we return to a common standard under which facts matter free speech will continue to rest on tenuous groundsben shapiro is the editor in chief of the daily wire and the host of the ben shapiro showjudith shulevitz it’s tempting to blame college and university administrators for the decline of free speech in america and for years i did just that if the guardians of higher education won’t inculcate the habits of mind required for serious thinking i thought who will the unfettered but civil exchange of ideas is the basic operation of education just as addition is the basic operation of arithmetic and universities have to teach both the unfettered part and the civil part because arguing in a respectful manner isn’t something anyone does instinctivelyso why change my mind now schools still cling to speech codes and there still aren’t enough deans like the one at the university of chicago who declared his school a safespacefree zone my alma mater just handed out prizes for “enhancing race andor ethnic relations” to two students caught on video harassing the dean of their residential college one screaming at him that he’d created “a space for violence to happen” the other placing his face inches away from the dean’s and demanding “look at me” all this because they deemed a thoughtful if illtimed letter about halloween costumes written by the dean’s wife to be an act of racist aggression yale should discipline students who behave like that even if they’re right on the merits i don’t think they were but that’s not the point they certainly don’t deserve awards i can’t believe i had to write that sentencebut in abdicating their responsibilites the universities have enabled something even worse than an attack on free speech they’ve unleashed an assault on themselves there’s plenty of free speech around we know that because so much bad speech—lowminded nonsense—tests our constitutional tolerance daily and that’s holding up pretty well as nicholas lemann observes elsewhere in this symposium facebook and google represent bigger threats to free speech than students and administrators what’s endangered is good speechuniversities were setting themselves up to be used provocateurs exploit the atmosphere on campus to goad overwrought students then gleefully trash the most important bastion of our crumbling civil society higher education and everything it stands for—logical argument the scientific method epistemological rigor—start to look illegitimate voters perceive tenure and research and higher education itself as hopelessly partisan and unworthy of taxpayers’ moneythe press is a secondary victim of this process of delegitimization if serious inquiry can be waved off as ideology then facts won’t be facts and reporting can’t be trusted all journalism will be equal to all other journalism and all journalists will be reduced to pests you can slam to the ground with near impunity politicians will be able to say anything and do just about anything and there will be no countervailing authority to challenge them i’m pretty sure that that way lies putinism and erdoganism and when we get to that point i’m going to start worrying about free speech againjudith shulevitz is a critic in new york harvey silverglate free speech is and has always been threatened the title of nat hentoff’s  book free speech for me – but not for thee is no less true today than at any time even as the supreme court has accorded free speech a more absolute degree of protection than in any previous erasince the s the high court has decided most major freespeech cases in favor of speech with most of the major decisions being unanimous or nearly sowomen’srights advocates were turned back by the high court in  when they sought to ban the sale of printed materials that because deemed pornographic by some were alleged to promote violence against women censorship in the name of gender–based protection thus failed to gain tractiondespite the demands of civilrights activists the supreme court in  declared crossburning to be a protected form of expression in rav v city of st paul a decision later refined to strengthen a narrow exception for when crossburning occurs primarily as a physical threat rather than merely an expression of hatredother attempts at first amendment circumvention have been met with equally decisive rebuff when the reverend jerry falwell sued hustler magazine publisher larry flynt for defamation growing out of a parody depicting falwell’s first sexual encounter as a drunken tryst with his mother in an outhouse a unanimous supreme court lectured on the history of parody as a constitutionally protected even if cruel form of social and political criticismwhen the south boston allied war veterans sponsor of boston’s saint patrick’s day parade sought to exclude a gay veterans’ group from marching under its own banner the high court unanimously held that as a private entity even though marching in public streets the veterans could exclude any group marching under a banner conflicting with the parade’s socially conservative message notwithstanding publicaccommodations laws the gay group could have its own parade but could not rain on that of the conservativesdespite such legal clarity today’s most potent attacks on speech are coming ironically from liberalarts colleges ubiquitous “speech codes” limit speech that might insult embarrass or “harass” in particular members of “historically disadvantaged” groups “safe spaces” and “trigger warnings” protect purportedly vulnerable students from hearing words and ideas they might find upsetting student demonstrators and threats of violence have forced the cancellation of controversial speakers left and rightit remains unclear how much campus censorship results from politically correct faculty controlobsessed studentlife administrators or students socialized and indoctrinated into intolerance my experience suggests that the bureaucrats are primarily although not entirely to blame when sued colleges either lose or settle pay a modest amount and then return to their censorious waysthis trend threatens the heart and soul of liberal education eventually it could infect the entire society as these students graduate and assume influential positions whether a resulting flood of censorship ultimately overcomes legal protections and weakens democracy remains to be seenharvey

interlocking systems of domination that produce the lethal conditions under which oppressed peoples are forced to live”some blame the new campus intolerance on hypersensitive overtrophied millennials but the students who signed that letter don’t appear to be fragile nor do those who recently shut down lectures at berkeley middlebury depaul and cal state la what they are is impassioned and their passion is driven by a theory known as intersectionalityintersectionality is the source of the new preoccupation with microaggressions cultural appropriation and privilegechecking it’s the reason more than  colleges and universities have set up bias response teams students who overhear potentially “otherizing” comments or jokes are encouraged to make anonymous reports to their campus brts a growing number of professors and administrators have built their careers around intersectionality what is it exactlyintersectionality is a neomarxist doctrine that views racism sexism ableism heterosexism and all forms of “oppression” as interconnected and mutually reinforcing together these “isms” form a complex arrangement of advantages and burdens a white woman is disadvantaged by her gender but advantaged by her race a latino is burdened by his ethnicity but privileged by his gender according to intersectionality american society is a “matrix of domination” with affluent white males in control not only do they enjoy most of the advantages they also determine what counts as “truth” and “knowledge”but marginalized identities are not without resources according to one of intersectionality’s leading theorists patricia collins former president of the american sociology association disadvantaged groups have access to deeper more liberating truths to find their voice and to enlighten others to the true nature of reality they require a safe space—free of microaggressive putdowns and imperious cultural appropriations here they may speak openly about their “lived experience” lived experience according to intersectional theory is a better guide to the truth than selfserving western and masculine styles of thinking so don’t try to refute intersectionality with logic or evidence that only proves that you are part of the problem it seeks to overcomehow could comfortably ensconced college students be open to a convoluted theory that describes their world as a matrix of misery don’t they flinch when they hear intersectional scholars like bell hooks refer to the us as an “imperialist whitesupremacist capitalist patriarchy” most take it in stride because such views are now commonplace in highschool history and social studies texts and the idea that knowledge comes from lived experience rather than painstaking study and argument is catnip to many undergradssilencing speech and forbidding debate is not an unfortunate byproduct of intersectionality—it is a primary goal how else do you dismantle a lethal system of oppression as the protesting students at claremont mckenna explained in their letter “free speech    has given those who seek to perpetuate systems of domination a platform to project their bigotry” to the student activists thinkers like heather macdonald and charles murray are agents of the dominant narrative and their speech is “a form of violence”it is hard to know how our institutions of higher learning will find their way back to academic freedom open inquiry and mutual understanding but as long as intersectional theory goes unchallenged campus fanaticism will intensifychristina hoff sommers is a resident

restrict speechconsciousness has been raised on campus the worst is over free speech has always been fragile i once took cameras to seton hall law school right after a professor gave a lecture on free speech students seemed to get the concept sean now a lawyer said “protect freedom for thought we hate otherwise you never have a society where ideas clash and we come up with the best idea” so i asked “should there be any limits” students listed “fighting words” “shouting fire in a theater” malicious libel etc— reasonable courtapproved exceptions but then they went further several wanted bans on “hate” speech “no value comes out of hate speech” said javier “it inevitably leads to violence”no it doesn’t i argued “also doesn’t hate speech bring ideas into the open so you can better argue about them bringing you to the truth”“no” replied floyd “with hate speech more speech is just violence”so i pulled out a big copy of the first amendment and wrote “exception hate speech”two students wanted a ban on flag desecration “to respect those who died to protect it”one wanted bans on blasphemy“look at the gravity of the harm versus the value in blasphemy—the harm outweighs the value”several wanted a ban on political speech by corporations because of “the potential for large corporations to improperly influence politicians”finally jillian also now a lawyer wanted hunting videos banned“it encourages harm down the road”i asked her incredulously “you’re comfortable locking up people who make a hunting film”“oh yeah” she said “it’s unnecessary cruelty to feeling and sentient beings”so i picked up my copy of the bill of rights again after “no law    abridging freedom of speech” i added “except hate speech flag burning blasphemy corporate political speech depictions of hunting    ”that embarrassed them “we may have gone too far” said sean  others agreed one said “cross out the exceptions” free speech survived but it was a close call respect for unpleasant speech will always be thin

would smother itjohn stossel is a fox newsfox business network contributorwarren treadgold even citizens of dictatorships are free to praise the regime and to talk about the weather the only speech likely to be threatened anywhere is the sort that offends an important and intolerant group what is new in america today is a leftist ideology that threatens speech precisely because it offends certain important and intolerant groups feminists and supposedly oppressed minoritiesso far this new ideology is clearly dominant only in colleges and universities where it has become so strong that most controversies concern outside speakers invited by students not faculty speakers or speakers invited by administrators most academic administrators and professors are either leftists or have learned not to oppose leftism otherwise they would probably never have been hired administrators treat even violent leftist protestors with respect and are ready to prevent conservative and moderate outsiders from speaking rather than provoke protests most professors who defend conservative or moderate speakers argue that the speakers’ views are indeed noxious but say that students should be exposed to them to learn how to refute them this is very different from encouraging a free exchange of ideasalthough the new ideology began on campuses in the ’s it gained authority outside them largely by means of several majority decisions of the supreme court from roe  to obergefell  the supreme court decisions that endanger free speech are based on a presumed consensus of enlightened opinion that certain rights favored by activists have the same legitimacy as rights explicitly guaranteed by the constitution—or even more legitimacy because the rights favored by activists are assumed to be so fundamental that they need no grounding in specific constitutional language the court majorities found restricting abortion rights or homosexual marriage as large numbers of americans wish to do to be constitutionally equivalent to restricting black voting rights or interracial marriage any denial of such equivalence therefore opposes fundamental constitutional rights and can be considered hate speech advocating psychological and possibly physical harm to groups like women seeking abortions or homosexuals seeking approval such speech may still be constitutionally protected but acting upon it is notthis ideology of forbidding allegedly offensive speech has spread to most of the democratic party and the progressive movement rather than seeing themselves as taking one side in a free debate progressives increasingly argue for example that opposing abortion is offensive to women and supporting the police is offensive to blacks some politicians object so strongly to such speech that despite their interest in winning votes they attack voters who disagree with them as racists or sexists expressing views that allegedly discriminate against women blacks homosexuals and various other minorities can now be grounds for a lawsuitspeech that supposedly offends women or minorities has already cost some people their careers their businesses and their opportunities to

financial institutions to shun many of the estimated  millionplus americans who live abroad even while blockchain virtuosos make illegal transactions wholly undetectable to authorities it has never been easier for americans to travel abroad and it’s never been harder to enter the us without showing passports fingerprints retinal scans and even socialmedia passwordswhat’s true for banking and tourism is doubly true for free speech social media has given everyone not just a platform but a megaphone as unreadable as our facebook timelines have all become since last november at the same time the federal government during this unhappy st century has continuously ratcheted up prosecutorial pressure against leakers whistleblowers investigative reporters and technology companiesa hopeful bulwark against government encroachment unique to the freespeech field is the supreme court’s very strong first amendment jurisprudence in the past decade or two donald trump like hillary clinton before him may prattle on about locking up flagburners but antonin scalia and the rest of scotus protected such expression back in  barack obama and john mccain and hillary clinton—she’s as bad as any recent national politician on free speech may lament the citizens united decision but it’s now firmly legal to broadcast unfriendly documentaries about politicians without fear of punishment no matter the electoral calendarbut in this very strength lies what might be the first amendment’s most worrying vulnerability barry friedman in his  book the will of the people made the persuasive argument that the supreme court typically ratifies post facto where public opinion has already shifted today’s culture of free speech could be tomorrow’s legal framework if so we’re in troublefor evidence of freespeech slippage just read around you when both majorparty presidential nominees react to terrorist attacks by calling to shut down corners of the internet and when their respective supporters are actually debating the propriety of sucker punching protesters they disagree with it’s hard to escape the conclusion that our increasingly shrill partisan sorting is turning the very foundation of post global prosperity into just another club to be swung in our national street fightin the eternal catandmouse game between private initiative and government control the former is always advantaged by the latter’s fundamental incompetence but what if the public willingly hands government the power to muzzle it may take a countercultural reformation to protect this most noble of american experimentsmatt welch is the editor at large of reasonadam j white free speech is indeed under threat on our university campuses but the threat did not begin there and it will not end there rather the campus freespeech crisis is a particularly visible symptom of a much more fundamental crisis in american culturethe problem is not that some students teachers and administrators reject traditional american values and institutions or even that they are willing to menace or censor others who defend those values and institutions such critics have always existed and they can be expected to use the tools and weapons at their disposal the problem is that our country seems to produce too few students teachers and administrators who are willing or able to respond to themamerican families produce children who arrive on campus unprepared for or uninterested in defending our values and institutions for our students who are focused primarily on their career prospects if on anything at all “college is just one step on the continual stairway of advancement” as david brooks observed  years ago “they’re not trying to buck the system they’re trying to climb it and they are streamlined for ascent hence they are not a disputatious group”meanwhile parents bear incomprehensible financial burdens to get their kids through college without a clear sense of precisely what their kids will get out of these institutions in terms of character formation or civic virtue with so much money at stake few can afford for their kids to pursue more than career prospectsthose problems are not created on campus but they are exacerbated there as too few college professors and administrators see their institutions as cultivators of american culture and republicanism confronted with activists’ rage they offer no competing vision of higher education—let alone a compelling oneironically we might borrow a solution from the left where progressives would leverage state power in service of their healthcare agenda we could do the same for education state legislatures and governors recognizing the present crisis should begin to reform and renegotiate the fundamental nature of state universities by making state universities more affordable more productive and more reflective of mainstream american values they will attract students—and create incentives for competing private universities to follow suitlet’s hope they do it soon for what’s at stake is much more than just free speech on campus or even free speech writ large in our time as in tocqueville’s “the instruction of the people powerfully contributes to the support of a democratic republic” especially “where instruction which awakens the understanding is not separated from moral education which amends the heart” we need our colleges to cultivate—not cut down—civic virtue and our capacity for selfgovernment “republican government presupposes the existence of these qualities in a higher degree than any other form” madison wrote in federalist  if “there is not sufficient virtue among men for selfgovernment” then “nothing less than the chains of despotism” can restrain us “from destroying and devouring one another”adam j white is a research fellow at the hoover institutioncathy young a writer gets expelled from the world science fiction convention for criticizing the scifi community’s preoccupation with racial and gender “inclusivity” while moderating a panel an assault on free speech or an exercise of free association how about when students demand the disinvitation of a speaker—or disrupt the speech when a critic of feminism gets banned from a socialmedia platform for unspecified “abuse”such questions are at the heart of many recent freespeech controversies there is no censorship by government but how concerned should we be when private actors effectively suppress unpopular speech even in the freest society some speech will—and should—be considered odious and banished to unsavory fringes no one weeps for ostracized holocaust deniers or pedophilia apologistsbut shunned speech needs to remain a narrow exception—or acceptable speech will inexorably shrink as current federal communications commission chairman ajit pai cautioned last year first amendment protections will be hollowed out unless undergirded by cultural values that support a free marketplace of ideassometimes attacks on speech come from the right in  an iraq war critic reporter chris hedges was silenced at rockford college in illinois by hecklers who unplugged the microphone and rushed the stage some conservative pundits defended this as robust protest yet the current climate on the left—in universities on social media in “progressive” journalism in intellectual circles—is particularly hostile to free expression the identitypolitics left fixated on subtle oppressions embedded in everyday attitudes and language sees speechpolicing as the solutionis hostility to freespeech values on the rise new york magazine columnist jesse singal argues that support for restrictions on public speech offensive to minorities has remained steady and fairly high since the s perhaps but the range of what qualifies as offensive—and which groups are to be shielded—has expanded dramatically in our time a leading liberal magazine the new republic can defend calls to destroy a painting of lynching victim emmett till because the artist is white and guilty of “cultural appropriation” and a feminist academic journal can be bullied into apologizing for an article on transgender issues that dares to mention “male genitalia”there is also a distinct trend of “bad” speech being squelched by coercion not just disapproval that includes the incidents at middlebury college in vermont and at claremont mckenna in california where mobs not only prevented conservative speakers—charles murray and heather mac donald—from addressing audiences but physically threatened them as well it also includes the use of civilrights legislation to enforce goodthink in the workplace businesses may face stiff fines if they don’t force employees to call a “nonbinary” coworker by the singular “they” even when talking among themselvesthese trends make a mockery of liberalism and enable the kind of backlash we have seen with donald trump’s election but the backlash can bring its own brand of authoritarianism it’s time to start rebuilding the culture of free speech across political divisions—a project that demands above all genuine openness and intellectual consistency otherwise it will remain as the late great nat hentoff put it a call for “free speech for me but not for thee”cathy young is a contributing editor at reasonrobert j zimmer free speech is not a natural feature of human society many people are comfortable with free expression for views they agree with but would withhold this privilege for those they deem offensive people justify such restrictions by various means the appeal to moral certainty political agendas demand for change opposing change retaining power resisting authority or more recently not wanting to feel uncomfortable moral certainty about one’s views or a willingness to indulge one’s emotions makes it easy to assert that others are doing true damage or creating unacceptable offense simply by presenting a fundamentally different perspectivethe resulting challenges to free expression may come in the form of laws threats pressure whether societal group or organizational or selfcensorship in the face of a prevailing consensus specific forms of challenge may be more or less pronounced as circumstances vary but the widespread temptation to consider the silencing of “objectionable” viewpoints as acceptable implies that the challenge to free expression is always presentthe united states today is no exception we benefit from the first amendment which asserts that the government shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech however fostering a society supporting free expression involves matters far beyond the law the ongoing and increasing demonization of one group by another creates a political and social environment conducive to suppressing speech even violent acts opposing speech can become acceptable or encouraged such behavior is evident at both political rallies and university events our greatest current threat to free expression is the emergence of a national culture that accepts the legitimacy of suppression of speech deemed objectionable by a segment of the populationuniversity and college campuses present a particularly vivid instance of this cultural shift there have been many wellpublicized episodes of speakers being disinvited or prevented from speaking because of their views however the problem is much deeper as there is significant selfcensorship on many campuses both faculty and students sometimes find themselves silenced by social and institutional pressures to conform to “acceptable” views ironically the very mission of universities and colleges to provide a powerful and deeply enriching education for their students demands that they embrace and protect free expression and open discourse failing to do so significantly diminishes the quality of the education they providemy own institution the university of chicago through the words and actions of its faculty and leaders since its founding has asserted the importance of free expression and its essential role in embracing intellectual challenge we continue to do so today as articulated by the chicago principles which strongly affirm that “the university’s fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the university community to be offensive unwise immoral or wrongheaded” it is only in such an environment that universities can fulfill their own highest aspirations and provide leadership by demonstrating the value of free speech within society more broadly a number of universities have joined us in reinforcing these values but it remains to be seen whether the faculty and leaders of many institutions will truly stand up for these values and in doing so provide a model for society as a wholerobert j zimmer is the president of the university of chicago choose your plan and pay

“innovators” in knowhow usein numerous cases the internet has arrive at certainly be a central aspect in selected regions of social development and specifically in social advocacy with all those

technical skills which include a lot of folks who have already been included while in the free software motion and open up source developments most notably linux have resisted and in some cases opposed the applying in their skillsets and outputs for business purposes even in assistance of social sector economic actionthere have even so been a wide range of endeavours mostly from those

needed to get a hold of optimal approaches for net primarily based commercelacking the sources or in several conditions the talents to explore options people with an desire had been struggling to establish sustained methods and when initial initiatives were being only partly impressive they were remaining to whither the entrepreneurial zeal and creativity which has marked the progress belonging to the worldwideweb and especially ecommerce within the very last couple yrs happens to be notably absent on the notforprofit sector partly it might be assumed since the totally individualism and entrepreneurialism which has been the basis for enhancement and achievement inside the forprofit and modest corporation sectors are exactly what is usually not present in the notforprofit sector where by there appears to generally be a whole lot more concern for typical instead than exclusive improvement and much significantly less financial threat gettingbut all these aside the assortment and importance of ecommerce is these kinds of that it might no more be overlooked via the ced sector as it is presenting as well effective a aggressive risk to this sector concerning some others the menace to neighborhood financial improvement from ecommerce is multiple foldecommerce tends to change financial action in the direction of pools of skill or in or else advantaged places on account of local climate geography and so forth and absent from marginal or deprived areasthe achievement of ecommerce is often with the price of community enterprises who now find out by themselves in direct competitors with vast variety truly affordable suppliers who might possibly be located any wherethe array of goods on hand around the net is quite sizable and can’t be

radically which is now from the number of a wide range of regional enterprisesthere is really an ongoing migration within the range of help and advice intense providers to the internet and absent from neighborhood shipping and native work as area distribution or service brokers are centralized and downsized as to illustrate banking companies authorities important information offices the producers of hometown directories etcdisintermediations allows for local purchasers to bypass nearest suppliers or neighborhood wholesalers and purchase directly from suppliers thus reducing whole strata of

resting and can keep going to relaxation is experience to face bodily delimited communities and it can be listed here wherever the ongoing and long run toughness and alternatives for development and growth of ced restsby recognizing that ecommerce plus the possibilities it offers isn’t any a good deal more technologically or dare i say it ideologically daunting than credit rating playing cards or

wars and again in the s he wrote that hubbert peak theory ignores the effects of economics and technological advances instead of a peak yergin predicts future oil production will be more of a plateau as increasing prices moderate demand and stimulate production he also addressed peak oil in a chapter in the quest entitled “is the world running out of oil” yergins skepticism toward peak oil has in turn been criticized by the theorys defenders for example jean laherrère contended in  that yergins predictions on energy production and prices omitted key facts leading yergin to draw incorrect conclusions another industry observer criticized yergins statement in september  that the price of crude oil was then higher than justified by fundamentals at the time of yergins statement the price of west texas intermediate oil was us per barrel the price peaked nine months later at us per barrel before dropping dramatically to us in the  financial crisis and fluctuating widely in subsequent
