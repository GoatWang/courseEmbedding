youquestions to ask a financial advisoronce you have found a few advisors you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisorhow many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money it is best to find someone with plenty of experience advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the stormwhat is your strongest focus area in financial planning some advisors are experts in retirement others have expertise in estates and trusts others still are best suited to help you pay for your childs education some financial advisors focus on people who are selfemployed be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need not what someone else needswhat is your budgeting philosophy every familys budget is unique budgets can be very detailed or more general some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals others take a more balanced approach find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yourshow are you compensated some financial advisors are “fee only” this means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio the worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds in this case a conflict of interest exists the advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needshow much does it cost to work with you after learning how they are paid make sure you know how much you will pay no one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meetingare you a fiduciary fiduciary means putting your needs first many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first even if it means they earn less money however many financial advisors are not fiduciaries and can give you advice that is not in your best interestdo you own the same investments youll suggest to me do they put their money where their mouth is advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flaghow have your clients portfolios performed how did you handle their portfolios during the great recession in  these questions get to the root of their performance if the advisor does not readily share this information they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past make sure your financial advisor is licensedfinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed the most common and important license for a financial advisor is the cfp or certified financial planner cfps are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topicsseries  and series  licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks bonds and other investments on your behalf make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an uptodate licensebeware of lofty promisesif an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the  presidential campaign proceed with caution promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done further no advisor can promise that they will beat the marketat the end of the day many financial advisors have similar skills they use comparable tools and reports to stay uptodate on the markets and help find the best investments for you if any advisor gives you a bad vibe dont feel bad looking elsewherechoose an advisor you can trustafter you have met with a few advisors it is time to make your decision asking about licenses fees and past performance is black and white there are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjectivedo you like the person do you trust them would you trust them with your daughters education fund your retirementif you have been able to limit your list down to your final few it is time to trust your gut it is important to have an advisor you like trust and enjoy interacting with your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you dont trust pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey

a financial advisor is a big decision unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist financial advisors are usually long term relationships they are also taking responsibility for your money with your entire livelihood on the line choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake avoid these  common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals hiring the first advisor you meetdepending on where you live you could have dozens of options for advisors it is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages this decision requires more time take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you choosing an advisor with the wrong specialtyadvisors can have different focus area some specialize on retirement planning some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth others are best for young professionals starting a family this type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse it makes them better for certain people than others be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses do that before signing on the dotted line picking an advisor with an incompatible strategyeach advisor has a unique strategy some advisors may suggest aggressive investments others are more conservative again there is no right or wrong however there is a right and wrong for you if you don’t feel comfortable with risk don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments if you prefer to go all in on stocks an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style skipping checking referencesmost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients if you ask about references and they act nervous thats a red flag quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned this helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future calling references only takes a couple of minutes it can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account not asking about credentialsto give investment advice financial advisors are required to pass a test ask your advisor about their licenses tests and credentials this ensures they are qualified to meet your needs financial advisors tests include the series  and series  or series  some advisors go a step further and become a certified financial planner or cfp also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned some advisors have a finance degree from a top school others could have an english degree from a community college making assumptions when they are affiliated with a reputable brandan advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like jp morgan or morgan stanley however that doesn’t make them a great advisor working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea it often leads to stability and better tools and information however they still have quite a bit of autonomy choose an advisor because they are the best fit not because of their branding not understanding how they are paidthere are different payment models for financial advisors some are “fee only” in this case they charge a flat rate no matter what others charge a percentage of assets under management some advisors are paid by mutual funds this is the worst situation for you this is a serious conflict of interest if the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests do not hire themdo your research to find the perfect advisorchoosing a financial advisor is an important decision it requires the best information available gathering information about financial advisors can be tough that is why smartasset created a financial advisor match tool answering basic questions results in a list of local advisors to choose from it doesnt matter if you need help with your finances or just want a second opinion find the perfect advisor for your needs today do i need

capital  privacy policy  proxy voting  adv  bcp strategy  atalanta sosnoff capital home people investment team compliance institutional wrap programs founder strategy commentary contact equity strategy large cap equity the company achieves long term success by employing our consistent adherence to our investment philosophy and process there are several distinguishing characteristics that set us apart style our philosophy of earnings acceleration is a refinement of traditional growth investing we benefit not only from the earnings growth rate but also from the multiple expansion rewarded to accelerating growth companies sustainability over time our investment professionals with years of experience have observed patterns of events that are critical to earnings acceleration these key drivers of growth are identified through our repeatable threestep process pragmatism we build portfolios based on our guiding principals of earnings acceleration our team generates a high conviction concentrated portfolio as we believe out performance requires the will to be different from the benchmark culture all firm resources are dedicated to the earnings acceleration strategy our flat organization has been built to provide clients with above average returns and hightouch client service we align ourselves with our clients through equity ownership and an employee profit sharing plan equity process given our focus on earnings acceleration our first step in the process is to identify catalysts which will lead to an increase in the growth rate each industry possesses unique variables critical to creating earnings acceleration typical catalysts include new products management changes supplydemand imbalances and restructuring and regulatory changes ideas are sourced through our vast network and through our experience in recognizing fundamental attributes that create accelerated earnings once our thesis of earnings acceleration has been identified we then conduct security analysis on the stock we take a task force approach in building out an earnings model by having all portfolio managers participate in research we are able to challenge each other and gain perspective as a result of speaking with company management customers suppliers competitors and industry experts we determine the potential impact of the catalyst on earnings  while we review street expectations we must gain independent conviction of our thesis before proceeding the third step of our process is to apply a valuation discipline to ensure that earnings growth is not yet built into the stock price not only do we consider historical valuation levels we also compare the stock’s valuation to its industry and peer groups this analysis can provide additional knowledge of upside potential and possible downside risk of each stock a price target is then set and monitored as earnings and company dynamics evolve buysell discipline in order to capture the benefits of earnings acceleration we must enter the cycle early thus we initiate a probe position of  as our conviction grows we increase the position to a full weight of  stocks are sold when target prices are met our thesis for earnings acceleration deteriorates or to make room in the portfolio for a stock with greater upside potential cash will fluctuate depending on idea generation and sell discipline   atalanta

use of our facility during that situation our primary facility has a limited life safety system and infrastructure designed to permit the building to operate despite failures of external power water

capital home people investment team compliance institutional wrap programs founder strategy commentary contact market commentary june   our equity results exceeded a robust stock market sp   in the first quarter and balanced accounts outperformed their benchmarks as well  stock selection largely drove excess returns  the largest contribution came from an eastern railroad an investment which illustrates the concept of “seeing things how they could be” we purchased the stock in last year’s second half after our research suggested that the company’s traffic drivers particularly coal volumes were approaching trough and that operational metrics train speed dwell time promised room for improvement  profit margins were at an industry low but we saw a path higher  apparently we were not alone as an activist investor took a sizeable stake and is installing a legendary railroad turnaround executive as the ceo  holdings in growth stocks such as added significant value in the quarter on the flip side our investment in the energy sector dragged on recent performance  domestic inventories of crude oil built during the quarter as us shale output rebounded and there was little apparent impact from opec production cuts  however a bit of deeper analysis shows that the constructive case remains intact  the planned timing of opec’s and its nonopec partners’ production cuts announced november   varied by country and ranged from weeks to months  in fact much of the crude oil imported to the us in the first quarter was ordered before the announcement  coupled with seasonally slack winter demand it was not surprising to see inventories increase  we expect this quarter to be very different as the full impact of production cuts is seen and we enter a period of strong demand created by the driving season  the next opec meeting will be may th and an extension of the cuts will be on the table   logic suggests that the lower levels of output will be extended as inventories will not have reached target by then  remember saudi arabia is planning to ipo its production company aramco early in  at what is reported to be a trillion dollar capitalization  that would seem like a fair amount of incentive to keep oil prices stable to higher  the kingdom recently reduced aramco’s corporate tax rate to  from  so they seem serious turning to broader financial markets the yield on the  year treasury bond has been in a trading range between  and  for the last four months  the “pushpull” here is that rates are below the level where they historically would be given current economic activityinflation but the incremental data shows no sign of acceleration  in fact recent auto sales and other indicators of consumption have been on the softer side  furthermore the likelihood of stimulus from tax reform was significantly diminished after the recent attempt at healthcare legislation revealed schisms within the republican party  however there are plenty of positive signs  housing activity is robust while jobs and wages continue to expand  europe has turned the corner as evidenced by the german  year yields going from negative to positive soon to be reported first quarter profits should show significant growth boosted by the energy sector rebounding from last year’s losses given conflicting macro currents we are much more focused on individual companies and select industries than broad sectors the exception being energy our largest sector thematic right now  our equity portfolio is pretty well balanced between economically sensitive holdings and classic growth properties  this past quarter we took a position in an industrial after research suggested rising orders as demand from the energy and mining segments now appear to approximate replacement levels  with lean inventories and the company’s strong demonstration of cost control throughout the down cycle incremental margins could be powerful given any normalization of shipments  we remain committed to our internet properties while recently increasing our holdings in the international space  within the energy sector we added to eog resources a lowcosthighunit growth property operating in the permian basin  although still underweighted the defensive sectors we recently initiated a probe position in an iconic beverage company on the potential of a new ceo invigorating returns through refranchising bottling operations improving marketing efficiency and reducing costs  it’s early but new management situations can be a fertile source of earnings acceleration as far back as we can remember with the stock market off to such a quick start this year there has been much discussion as to whether it is “overvalued”  we don’t think so  the chart below shows that the sp ’s earnings yield’s inverse of pe spread over corporate bond is roughly at its historic average  note the extreme negative level overvaluation during the  time period source evercore isi report date april   the take here is that stocks are neither particularly cheap nor expensive compared to bonds so valuation is not the critical variable right now  a more important issue is whether the economy can gain traction after a somewhat slow first quarter looking forward we are not expecting a smooth ride but this has been an unloved bull market that has fought fears of deflation brexit and the occasional twitter bomb  let’s give it some respect although the statements of fact and data in this report have been obtained from and are based upon sources that the firm

atalanta sosnoff capital  privacy policy  proxy voting  adv  bcp strategy  atalanta sosnoff capital home people investment team compliance institutional wrap programs founder strategy commentary contact equity strategy large cap equity the company achieves long term success by employing our consistent adherence to our investment philosophy and process there are several distinguishing characteristics that set us apart style our philosophy of earnings acceleration is a refinement of traditional growth investing we benefit not only from the earnings growth rate but also from the multiple expansion rewarded to accelerating growth companies sustainability over time our investment professionals with years of experience have observed patterns of events that are critical to earnings acceleration these key drivers of growth are identified through our repeatable threestep process pragmatism we build portfolios based on our guiding principals of earnings acceleration our team generates a high conviction concentrated portfolio as we believe out performance requires the will to be different from the benchmark culture all firm resources are dedicated to the earnings acceleration strategy our flat organization has been built to provide clients with above average returns and hightouch client service we align ourselves with our clients through equity ownership and an employee profit sharing plan equity process given our focus on earnings acceleration our first step in the process is to identify catalysts which will lead to an increase in the growth rate each industry possesses unique variables critical to creating earnings acceleration typical catalysts include new products management changes supplydemand imbalances and restructuring and regulatory changes ideas are sourced through our vast network and through our experience in recognizing fundamental attributes that create accelerated earnings once our thesis of earnings acceleration has been identified we then conduct security analysis on the stock we take a task force approach in building out an earnings model by having all portfolio managers participate in research we are able to challenge each other and gain perspective as a result of speaking with company management customers suppliers competitors and industry experts we determine the potential impact of the catalyst on earnings  while we review street expectations we must gain independent conviction of our thesis before proceeding the third step of our process is to apply a valuation discipline to ensure that earnings growth is not yet built into the stock price not only do we consider historical valuation levels we also compare the stock’s valuation to its industry and peer groups this analysis can provide additional knowledge of upside potential and possible downside risk of each stock a price target is then set and monitored as earnings and company dynamics evolve buysell discipline in order to capture the benefits of earnings acceleration we must enter the cycle early thus we initiate a probe position of  as our conviction grows we increase the position to a full weight of  stocks are sold when target prices are met our thesis for earnings acceleration deteriorates or to make room in the portfolio for a stock with greater upside potential cash will fluctuate depending on idea

are looking for before you start lookinghere are some common needs from financial advisors cash flow management budgeting retirement planning investing paying for childrens education no financial advisor is perfect for every need which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyonehow to find a financial advisoryour first step in choosing a financial advisor after

 registered financial advisors in the united states smartassets financial advisor search tool can help you navigate to the best advisor for your needs answer questions about where you live your plans for retirement and other financial priorities in just a few minutes youll be all set and smartasset will have an advisor contact youquestions to ask a financial advisoronce you have found a few advisors you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisorhow many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money it is best to find someone with plenty of experience advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the stormwhat is your strongest focus area in financial planning some advisors are experts in retirement others have expertise in estates and trusts others still are best suited to help you pay for your childs education some financial advisors focus on people who are selfemployed be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need not what someone else needswhat is your budgeting philosophy every familys budget is unique budgets can be very detailed or more general some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals others take a more balanced approach find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yourshow are you compensated some financial advisors are “fee only” this means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio the worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds in this case a conflict of interest exists the advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needshow much does it cost to work with you after learning how they are paid make sure you know how much you will pay no one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meetingare you a fiduciary fiduciary means putting your needs first many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first even if it means they earn less money however many financial advisors are not fiduciaries and can give you advice that is not in your best interestdo you own the same investments youll suggest to me do they put their money where their mouth is advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flaghow have your clients portfolios performed how did you handle their portfolios during the great recession in  these questions get to the root of their performance if the advisor does not readily share this information they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past make sure your financial advisor is licensedfinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed the most common and important license for a financial advisor is the cfp or certified financial planner cfps are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topicsseries  and series  licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks bonds and other investments on your behalf make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an uptodate licensebeware of lofty promisesif an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the  presidential campaign proceed with caution promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done further no advisor can promise that they will beat the marketat the end of the day many financial advisors have similar skills they use comparable tools and reports to stay uptodate on the markets and help find the best investments for you if any advisor gives you a bad vibe dont feel bad looking elsewherechoose an advisor you can trustafter you have met with a few advisors it is time to make your decision asking about licenses fees and past performance is black and white there are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjectivedo you like the person do you trust them would you trust them with your daughters education fund your retirementif you have been able to limit your list down to your final few it is time to trust your gut it is important to have an advisor you like trust and enjoy interacting with your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you dont trust pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey if you do youll be on track for a great financial futureif youre ready to

edityour financial detailsgot it  mistakes people make when choosing a financial advisor your details done by eric rosenberg january   choosing a financial advisor is a big decision unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist financial advisors are usually long term relationships they are also taking responsibility for your money with your entire livelihood on the line choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake avoid these  common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals hiring the first advisor you meetdepending on where you live you could have dozens of options for advisors it is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages this decision requires more time take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you choosing an advisor with the wrong specialtyadvisors can have different focus area some specialize on retirement planning some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth others are best for young professionals starting a family this type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse it makes them better for certain people than others be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses do that before signing on the dotted line picking an advisor with an incompatible strategyeach advisor has a unique strategy some advisors may suggest aggressive investments others are more conservative again there is no right or wrong however there is a right and wrong for you if you don’t feel comfortable with risk don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments if you prefer to go all in on stocks an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style skipping checking referencesmost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients if you ask about references and they act nervous thats a red flag quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned this helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future calling references only takes a couple of minutes it can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account not asking about credentialsto give investment advice financial advisors are required to pass a test ask your advisor about their licenses tests and credentials this ensures they are qualified to meet your needs financial advisors tests include the series  and series  or series  some advisors go a step further and become a certified financial planner or cfp also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned some advisors have a finance degree from a top school others could have an english degree from a community college making assumptions when they are affiliated with a reputable brandan advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like jp morgan or morgan stanley however that doesn’t make them a great advisor working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea it often leads to stability and better tools and information however they still have quite a bit of autonomy choose an advisor because they are the best fit not because of their branding not understanding how they are paidthere are different payment models for financial advisors some are “fee only” in this case they charge a flat rate no matter what others charge a percentage of assets under management some advisors are paid by mutual funds this is the worst situation for you this is a serious conflict of interest if the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests do not hire themdo your research to find the perfect advisorchoosing a financial advisor is an important decision it requires the best information available gathering information about financial advisors can be tough that is why smartasset created a financial advisor match tool answering basic questions results in a
