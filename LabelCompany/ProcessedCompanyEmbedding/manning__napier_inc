library our comprehensive collection of investment insights featured product manning  napier fund inc strategic income series april    active management today’s environment has become increasingly challenging for investors that are reliant on income generation economic growth in the us and abroad remains sluggish valuations for both fixed income and equity securities have become less compelling forward return expectations are relatively muted and interest rates along with bond yields remain near historically low levels against this backdrop income generation opportunities have become scarcer and finding suitable investment options that meet the needs of today’s incomeoriented investors has become more challenging at manning  napier we understand that reaching investment objectives utilizing the more traditional approaches available for incomeoriented investors eg a simple balanced portfolio consisting of  stocks and  bonds has become difficult furthermore simply reaching for the highest yielding securities in an effort to generate a stronger income stream is risky as higher yield is typically reflective of higher risk with all the challenges that currently exist it is important to consider alternative portfolio options that seek to provide sustainability of income and aim to meet investor needs over time manning  napier’s strategic income conservative and strategic income moderate series are multiasset class portfolios that seek to address the challenges in today’s market environment and act as alternatives to the more traditional yieldseeking strategies found in the marketplace the strategic income conservative series is intended for investors who have current income needs a shorter investment horizon and less ability to withstand market volatility the strategic income moderate series is intended for investors who have current income needs and a relatively long investment horizon there are four considerations that play a key role in the management process of the series which we believe are necessary for incomefocused investors navigating today’s environment duration management duration is a bond’s price sensitivity to a change in interest rates expressed as a number of years bonds with longer durations are more sensitive to interest rate changes than bonds with shorter durations in a rising interest rate environment—such as what we may experience going forward—longer duration bonds could experience heavy losses especially if interest rates spike conversely shorter duration bonds are less sensitive to rising interest rates and can help mitigate losses resulting from higher rates credit management moving beyond the relative safety of us treasuries may be a viable option for investors seeking to increase current portfolio yield credit investments can include corporate debt options ranging from investmentgrade to high yield utilizing high yield debt in a portfolio can be an important tool but the key is using it in the proper manner at the right time while high yield fixed income securities have historically provided strong returns the potential for significant losses within this asset class is a reality that investors could face at various points in the market cycle this necessitates an active approach to managing credit exposure weighing the risks and opportunities that characterize the prevailing market environment equity dividends an allocation to dividendpaying stocks can be another important tool utilized by investors who are looking for alternative ways to generate income as dividends have played a meaningful role in overall stock returns over the long run not all dividendpaying companies are equal however it is important to have a framework for evaluating the merits of individual companies from an income perspective as well as more importantly from a fundamental investment perspective investors should look for companies with sustainable dividends growing dividends andor special situations eg incomegenerating securities that are compellingly valued due to unique market conditions diversification into other income sources real estate in the form of real estate investment trusts reits can provide another source of income for investors reits are required by the irs to pay out at least  of their income to shareholders meaning reits can provide higher yields than those typically found in the traditional fixed income markets another one of the attractive elements from a diversification perspective is that real estate may provide a natural hedge against inflation as rents can be reset higher in an improving inflationary economy reits are certainly not riskfree so it is important to be selective when targeting the sector we believe that taking these key considerations into account when managing the strategic income conservative and moderate series enables us to manage risk for our clients while pursuing both growth and income generation opportunities diversifying beyond the more traditional incomeoriented approaches can provide attractive alternatives to investors looking to generate income in today’s yieldstarved world manning  napier fund inc

investing carefully consider the objectives risks charges and expenses of the investment and read the prospectus carefully as it contains this and other information about the investment company for regulatory purposes not all series are offered in all states a word about strategic income series risk all investments involve risks including possible loss of principal an investment in the series will fluctuate in response to stock market movements and changes in interest rates because the series invests in a combination of other affiliated funds it is subject to asset allocation risk as well as the risks associated with each underlying fund’s investment portfolio these may include the risk that dividends may be discontinued or decreased smallcapmidcap risk including the risk that stocks of small and midcap companies may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than the stocks of larger companies and may be less marketable than the stocks of larger companies risks related to investments in options which like all derivatives can be highly volatile and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based such as counterparty correlation and liquidity risk risks related to the direct ownership of real estate including reits such as interest rate risk liquidity risk and changes in property value among others foreign investment risk including fluctuating currency values different accounting standards and economic and political instability as well as the risk that investments in emerging markets may be more volatile than investments in developed markets issuerspecific risk and the increased default risk associated with higheryielding lowerrated securities there is an inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates as interest rates rise bond prices and therefore the value of bond funds fall likewise as interest rates fall bond prices and the value of bond funds rise additionally a portion of the series’ underlying holdings may be invested in business development companies bdcs or master limited partnerships mlps bdcs are subject to additional risks as they generally invest in less mature private companies or thinly traded us public companies which involve greater risk than wellestablished publiclytraded companies mlps are subject to additional risks including risks associated with the specific industry or industries in which the partnership invests such as the risks of investing in real estate or oil and gas industries or other natural resources moreover the
