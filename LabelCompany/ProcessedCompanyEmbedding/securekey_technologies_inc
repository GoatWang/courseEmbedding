technologies inc has the products services people and investors  to really win big in canada the us and a number of other markets company profile wwwsecurekeycom securekey technologies inc provides an innovative platformasaservice for authentication payment and identity by embedding its security client in laptops tablets and mobile devices securekey enables partners to deliver scalable easytouse solutions with the security of chipbased identity and payment credentials financial institutions healthcare providers telecoms and government organizations are using securekey today to provide twofactor and federated authentication and identity solutions securekey is a privatelyheld company based in toronto canada with backing from leading technology payments and mobile industry network providers for more information visit wwwsecurekeycom charles walton chief executive officer charlie has been involved in the information security industry for more than  years  recently as coo and general manager for inside secures nfc  payments business he was responsible for defining business strategy driving product strategy and development and leading the launch of new contactless and nfc chip products he was instrumental in securing key nfc business with intel and rim and for the rollout of contactless payments within the us bankcard market as the founder of caradas he was involved in authentication and smart card system development  integration programs with visa mastercard fleet bank and target he had served as coo of diversinet with focus on mobile security and with securify certco and spyrus all in the smart card  security sectors he was the cofounder of the cybertrust business at gte and captured first contract wins with mastercard american express and the cybertrust japan joint venture his early career at gte government systems was focused on the development of largescale secure communication systems for defense segment customers   charlie holds a bachelor of science in computer and systems engineering from rpi in  technology identity protection private securekey technologies inc york mills centre  york mills road toronto on canada mp e phone  wwwsecurekeycom   interview conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfo magazine published  september   ceocfo mr walton what attracted you to securekey and what skills do you bring to the table that the company needs at this point in time mr walton first i have known the company since the beginning and i have been quite close with greg wolfond the founder and current ceo we have great chemistry between us and over the years have developed a good friendship and then a partnership with the company i am now leaving inside secure i have followed securekey closely and am attracted by the fact that it is at a fairly important inflection point of growth   the services of the company have been validated by the government of canada and the intel deal that has been set in place has been quite substantial i have been close to intel historically so i understand the valid reasons for the intelsecurekey connection i am also quite attracted by the validation that has come from strategic investors the company is in a growth trajectory and i think that with the investors that have recently come in we have the capital the people and the right services to lead forward to the next level in many respects that has aligned well with my background and my history in security and authentication at inside secure i helped the company grow from very early stages when it was about the size of securekey now to a much more substantial company the synergy amongst the core security technology my involvement in financial services and the smart devices ecosystem is ideal ceocfo what is it you are doing now and what will you be doing a year from now mr walton today the key thing is deployment of securekeys authentication services and really extending the power of chipbased id and payment technologies for online pcbased and mobilebased transactions securekey is currently focused on serving the financial services sector government healthcare and other industries where security privacy and convenience are priority one of the key challenges of moving forward given the fairly broad applicability of the securekey services will be the growth strategy this is one of the reasons that greg has asked me to come into the company it was really to help map out a sensible strategy for growth in many respects being too shy about growth or being too aggressive about growth could be the wrong thing for the company we are really trying to make sure that we are taking a very pragmatic approach on growing the company which means mapping out where we take that growth in geographies and in vertical markets the focus of the growth and that strategy is one of the key things that we will be working on very early in my tenure at securekey ceocfo what does securekey provide and how does the service compare to what has been done traditionally and some of the newer methods that are being looked at as well mr walton one of the nicest examples is a demonstration that was done earlier this year at the ces conference in las vegas with intel corporation a partner of securekey securekeys authentication technology is being incorporated into intels identity protection technology and next generation ultrabooks will include securekey authentication services the usecase demonstrated at that conference is quite evocative of what we will begin to see from securekey here a device either a contactless smart card or a mobile phone with nfc near field communication capability was tapped against an ultrabook equipped with intels identity protection technology  and by definition securekeys authentication technology  to show on online payment transaction the information for purchase was formfilled making the payment transaction easytouse with either my card or nfc phone that is a terrific example of securekeys authentication technology what sets securekey apart is that with the mechanisms that have been bolted in it has been very simple to deploy and for a user nothing is simpler than waving something they already have against their own ultrabook device ceocfo is the public ready for the next level of security mr walton security is a funny thing it does not have the appeal of a new iphone or consumer electronic device or flashy new gadget out there but when customers say they want to make a payment with their phone or they want to use their phone to open a hotel room door you find that their concern is whether their information is safe and if their privacy is maintained i would say that while the security services that securekey is offering do not have the flashy appeal as consumer electronics they are beginning to address what has been a dominant issue on the part of consumers who are intent on adopting new types of mobile services we believe consumers will absolutely gravitate to this they will see that this is a way to secure their data that it has a very easy intuitive feel that will ultimately make their life easier and more secure that is a winwin in some sense we cannot really think about security as an overarching consumer service but rather an innate part of performing online and mobile transactions with integrity we think securekeys technology will ultimately deliver great value for the consumer ceocfo what is the competitive landscape for securekey and what is it about your system that is superior mr walton i would say that its the core technology that has been put together in a manner that is properly balanced to deliver security conveniently the coupling of security with convenience has been done exceptionally well by securekey the underlying technical development of course contributes to that i would say that secondly it is the companys approach into market  becoming incorporated into the ecosystem working closely with intel establishing strategic investment relationships with the major card brands in north america and securekeys footprint into government the awardwinning core security work coupled with convenience and the market approach has been unique on the part of the company ceocfo is it safe to assume that your ideas have been protected properly mr walton yes they have ceocfo you mentioned the government of canada what is going on there in terms of security mr walton well as part of the government of canadas new online authentication service securekey was awarded a contract to provide a credential brokering service that enables citizens to use their bank authentication credentials to gain access to online services this provides a way for a consumer with a contactless card or even in the future an nfcequipped phone to be able to gain access to citizenbased functions this leverages security credentials that have been issued out in the world through the banks authentication credentials and major payment groups ceocfo how do you keep up with all the trends and changing technologies considering that so many come and go mr walton i think it is a matter of trying to envision the future to date securekey has done a very good job of laying the foundation for access to services through mobile devices having that vision and being highly focused upon it will be key the challenge going forward in the next year will be the focus on growth that is not too fast or too slow and making the right choices on both partner and customer engagements i would say that our alignment with intel has been very substantial securekey has been very fastmoving has seen the future and has made the right choices in the early days on selecting opportunities and delivering the next stage is to begin widening the focus appropriately ceocfo will you be making changes or adding to the team as you continue in the commercialization area or is that still up for review mr walton it is still up for review i know greg has put together a wonderful team and the management team is topnotch i would say the most critical thing is setting up properly for growth i do not see anything lacking at all in the company it is now a matter of growing in geographies and verticals that are the best suited for us that is where the focus will be through the coming ninety days or so ceocfo development is expensive is the company funded through the next steps mr walton we recently concluded a fundraising round which was a very substantial round for the company in the sense that we raised nearly  million the round was led by intel and we were thrilled that they were able to do that we also brought new strategic investors visa mastercard discover rogers venture partners and telus into our equity mix ceocfo our readers are primarily investors and people are always looking at new ideas why should people pay attention to securekey mr walton i see securekey at the center of a next wave of computing in many respects if we look at how computing changed in the  timeframe we saw the emergence of web browsers and servers and of early stage ecommerce the landscape changed and never went back   we are now in the midst of the next level of substantial change driven by mobility which continues to accelerate this year we have seen a flip as tabletbased devices were deployed more substantially than pcbased laptop devices we are beginning to see more mobility with lightweight laptops ultrabooks tablets smart phones and other lowerend smart phones in the industry at large we see attacks on our computing devices becoming more substantial so it is really import to be laying down a solid authentication foundation to allow more types of transactions to occur in a secure manner that is  convenient for the consumer i see securekey at the center of helping the industry to secure many more types of transactions securekey has focused on applying security and authentication to mobile devices which makes the company super interesting i have a great deal of excitement about that and is certainly the reason i am on board ceocfo is there anything you would like to talk about that we have not covered mr walton securekey is at an exciting stage and is set up for some substantial growth i am thrilled to be coming in now
