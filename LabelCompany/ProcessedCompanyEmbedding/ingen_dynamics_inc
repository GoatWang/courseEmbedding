robotchargersmart appliance kit optionalsmart ball for pet lovers optionalcustom skin kit optionalcharging dock optional what does aido’s tabletop mode let me dowe know that there are times when you’d just have aido on your desk helping out with chores aido comes with a detachable ‘head’ section that can be easily pulled out and placed on a table the tabletop mode for aido lets you use most of aido’s functionality includinguse voice commands to control aidocontrol your tv home theatre system and more using aido’s universal remote functionality note aido needs to be in line of sight of the devicescontrol your smart devices that support standards like zigbee zwave ble wifi  dlnause the interactive projector for gesture based tasksuse the optional hd multimedia projector for enjoying mediause sensors to trigger alerts in case of fire smoke or excessive noise aido’s tabletop mode has a battery life of approximately  hours  what does the smart charging dock do ​having to remember to charge devices is such a chore one of aido’s cool features is the smart charging dock when aido runs low on charge aido can automatically detect the charging dock and plug itself inaido’s dock has a specially designed set of two charging rings one of positive polarity and the other negativethe charging rings are designed in a semicircular fashion to increase probability of touching aido’s charging circuits no matter how aido rolls into the dockthe charging rings have special circuitry to prevent a short circuit in case it encounters a foreign objectonce aido rolls into the dock the charging rings are activated and drive charge to aido the charging dock is also designed to make it easy for aido to plug itself into and out of the dock  can i give aido a different namefor now you will have to call him by his name aido to interact with him name customization will be available in the future  can i turn aido offyou can ask aido to go to sleep and he will turn off all functionality barring navigation haptic sensors and voice recognition aido springs back to life when you ask him to wake up or tap him what can i use aido’s smart appliance kit foraidos smart appliance kit allows you to control appliances that do not have interactive capabilities built in aidos smart appliance kit consists of  smart plugs plug your appliance like an ac or a water heater into the smart plug aido lets you turn them on or off schedule timings or set triggers  for example you can program aido to turn on the water heater  minutes before your alarm goes off in the morning  if you forget to turn it off aido can send a notification on your companion iosandroid app and and you can turn off the appliance using the app  smart bulbs replace your regular bulbs with the smart bulbs and control features like light dimming or turning lights onoff using aido for example you can program lights to dim automatically when you turn the tv on or after a certain time of the day or by sensing ambient light what is aido’s smart ball accessory foraido comes with an optional smart ball accessory for pet lovers you can control the ball using voice commands or through aido’s companion app on iosandroid and make it roll around home for your pets to play with the smart ball is durable and waterproof so your dog can pick it up in their mouth or drop it hisher waterbowl and it won’t cause any damage what can i do with the aido companion appyou can set a lot of aido’s functionality or view alerts of what’s happening at home using the aido companion app aido’s companion

etcimagesvideo of your homenotifications when someone’s at the door if connected to a smart door cameraand more how rugged is aidoaido is pretty tough and goes through extensive hardware testing we do ask that you take reasonable care and avoid hard drops knocking aido hard water and other situations that could damage aido keep aido away from long exposure to sunlight aido’s touchscreen is made of glass and requires the same caution that you would use with a tablet or phone screenaido’s ball base can traverse carpets and flat surfaces we however recommend that you keep your floor clean for aido’s mobility to work well aido may have problems navigating spills or water on the floor so we ask that you keep aido away from areas like bathrooms and clear up spills quicklyaido is a sophisticated electronic device so we’d expect you to keep aido safe from water and coffee spills can i throw the smart ballwhile the smart ball has been designed to withstand drops and shocks we recommend you roll the smart ball and control it with aido for the best play experience how fast can aido moveaido’s speed depends on the friction on the surface he moves on and whether there are obstacles on the ground we are still clocking aido’s speed on a set of surfaces and will update details on our website how does aido find his way to the smart charging dockdocking aido isn’t easy and our team had to work through multiple challenges to get this to work well our patent pending approach involves three phases to dock aido initial ranging is done based on wifi signal strength tracking and object recognitiononce aido reaches the room where the smart dock is he tracks ir beacons from the smart dock when the ir beacons are locked they guide aido towards the smart dockthe smart dock also has a small laser diode closer to the dock aido tries locking into this signal this helps aido judge the orientation and entry into the dock how does aido’s charging dock workthe easiest way to charge aido is to use the optional smart charging dock that lets aido charge autonomously aido’s dock has a specially designed set of two charging rings one of positive polarity and the other negativethe charging rings are designed in a semicircular fashion to increase probability of touching aido’s charging circuits no matter how aido rolls into the dockthe charging rings have special circuitry to prevent a short circuit in case it encounters a foreign objectonce aido rolls into the dock the charging rings are activated and drive charge to aido what processor and os does aido run onaido’s core system runs on two quadcore ghz processors each with gb ddr ram aido’s core operating system is a headless version of ubuntu we have removed unnecessary drivers  modules that aido doesn’t need we are calling this version openaido and will be releasing this back under an open source license so that other robotics solutions can use the same system aido’s android frontend runs on a rockwell chip with mb ram this is a version of android lollipop with a custom ui interface for rich interactions with users how much storage does aido haveaido supports gb of internal storage can i add more storage to aidoaido comes with  external usb ports you can connect a usb drive or a portable hard disk to increase aido’s storage how do linux and android talk to each otherlinux and android communicate over a secure vpn at all timesif there is a wifi connection available both systems connect to it and communicate over thisif there is no wifi network available the linux system acts as a wifi hotspot and the android system connects to it as a client what apis are available to extend aido can i hack into the linux systemaido will be providing a standard sdk and apis for basic control and some user defined programs all access will be provided through a custom  wrapper to keep aido secure exact details will be released shortly how is the developer edition different from the regular editiondevelopers will have early access to our sdk including libraries headers documentation samples for integrating aido and most importantly the support of our team developers are also the first to receive aido upon shipping how do i get information and support as a developerwhen you preorder an aido developer edition you will become a full member of our aido developers community dedicated members of our team will provide additional support to those who enrol in the aido developer community why do you have two projectors on aidoaido has an inbuilt head mounted interactive projector that lets you engage with your projected content and it comes with an optional hd multimedia projector that is designed for multimedia usage the head mounted interactive projector is designed for quick onoff operations you could ask aido to do a google search and show you results since the projector has gesture recognition built in you can flick to see more results or tap in the air to open a particular linkthe interactive projector is also of great use in the kitchen you can ask aido to show you a recipe and as you’re cooking use the swipe gesture to look through instructions as you go alongthe interactive projector lets you play quick and fun gesture based gamesthe hd multimedia projector is designed for entertainment buffs the hd multimedia projector lets you watch media by projecting it on a wall at a distance of up to m since aido can move around on its own you can ask aido to project media near where you sit or call your friends over and play a movie to enjoy with your drinks what sensors does aido have how can they be usedaido comes with a powerful set of sensors these let you quantify parameters around your home and instruct aido to take corrective action if required aido has sensors for air qualitytemperaturehumiditynoiseambient lightpressuregravity axis gsensor aido’s air quality sensor measures real indoor pollution rather than just co levels the temperature sensor lets you measure and track temperature for each room or area in the house aido’s light sensor tracks ambient light and duration the sensor data can be used in the task automator to trigger functions eg turn heater on when temperature dips below a certain threshold aido’s sensors also serve well in its patrol mode you can set aido to patrol your home when you aren’t around aido can take regular readings of the vital statistics of your home it can also look for signs of unusual activity and send you a notification if there’s an intruder or if there’s firesmoke why do you have two batteries in aido how do they work togetheraido has a unique dualbattery design  half leadacid and half nickelcadmium to balance the two requirements of a battery for a device like this  a it should charge fast and b it should retain power over long periods of time both battery packs are in hot standby mode aido also has a patent pending power management board aido’s battery should last about  hours on regular usage including  hours of mobility is the face a custom skin on androidour team has studied a lot of research material about how robots and humans interact we designed the ui to be a friendly approachable and communicative interface the ui is also designed so that you can see it from across the room we expect that a lot of the interactions with aido happen over voice so the ui accommodates various possibilities of using voice gestures and touch the ui layer is built on top of android so all your google play store apps will run without problems on aido how does the interactive projector workthe interactive projector uses the infrared blaster to illuminate the area in front of the projector it also has an ir camera detector built in when you make gestures in front of the interactive projector your arm bounces off infrared rays that the detector reads and depending on the ui state it recognizes actions how does aido understand what we saywe believe that voice will play a huge role in making robots more useful when designing aido we focused on ensuring that users could talk to aido and aido could reply back in a conversational  more personal manner aido has a  mic array set around a circular base with a dedicated hardware chip for listening to human voice even in noisy environments it is the same design that many smart tvs use to allow users to control functions using voiceaido uses a leading rd party speech engine based on a custom deep neural net architecture for continuous speech recognitionthis allows aido to listen to commands and parse them into instructions that aido understands what does aido use for image recognitionimage or object recognition is key for a autonomous robot like aido aido needs to identify items when navigating and decide real time how to avoid them when it’s moving we scouted around for software to help with this and chose uncanny vision’s offline image recognition library to power aido’s image recognition uncanny vision is a technology firm based out of japan and india that has over  years of experience in the computer vision area some key advantages are uncanny vision’s image recognition library recognizes over  objectsthe library runs offline with a low memory footprint aido is able to recognize objects up to x faster than conventional methods using simd instructions offline recognition also cuts out network latency and makes the image recognition more stableanother advantage of the low latency is that it allows aido to do a framebyframe comparison of visual input using this aido is able to figure out if there are moving objects in the frame if these are in the path it has to traverse aido stops to avoid a collision how does the scene recognition workif you were to look out your at this moment you might see a landscape that includes a number of trees a few buildings pedestrians on the road and a dustbin turning your gaze the other direction you may see a lake a bus stop a dog and an arriving bus even though you are seeing objects what you see in each view is more than just a group of objects—it is a composite item we label a “scene” object recognition and face recognition algorithms have reached near human performance in good lighting till a while ago computer vision was largely limited to recognizing individual objects current advances in artificial intelligence have created software capable of recognizing and describing the content of photographs and videos with far greater accuracy than ever before sometimes even mimicking human levels of understanding this new class of software called scene recognition can teach itself to identify entire scenes a group of young men playing football for example or a group of pedestrians waiting to cross the road the software then writes a caption in english describing the picture compared with human observations the computerwritten descriptions are surprisingly accurate with scene recognition you’re trying to tell the story behind the image a natural scene will be very complex and you want to pick out the most important objects in the image aido uses libraries from a leading vision vendor to do scene recognition how does the task automator work in aidohe task automator presents the user with an array of builtin options to use in a visual interface with the task automator you canselect predefined task flows from a large list of templatesadd and save your own template listshare and download new task flows from the android store the task automator can accommodate just about any type of simple or complex automation without the need to create batch files or write complicated scripts as it uses a visual interface that lets you simply select and combine action to fit your needs there is a wide range of actions for working with files internet ftp email datasets and much more conditional actions allow you to execute tasks automatically when triggered eg if an intruder is detected if your internet connection goes down if there is new email and more you can choose to receive alerts on your mobile phone app as well examples includedisplaying an alert when you receive an email from a particular friendautomatically project your news feed  minutes after your alarm goes offcapture and send you a photograph if an intruder alert is triggered does aido support weekday and weekend schedulesaido’s visual task automator lets you create actions using simple draganddrop you can trigger actions on an event or on a particular day you can create schedules for weekdays weekends holidays or any specific pattern you choose wake up half an hour earlier on monday if you choose to for example you can set a weekday schedule on aido toturn the alarm on at  am you can program it to show a video of your favourite holiday spot play music or even turn the lights on gradually to wake you upturn on the water heater  minutes before the alarmcheck your calendar and let you know of any traffic alerts in the morning you should be aware ofautomatically patrol home every hour after you’ve left for officesend alerts to you in case of an intruder fire smoke or excessive noise in the task automator aido supports integration toall smart devices aido connects using zigbee ble wifi zwave or dlnaa vast suite of devices with an infrared remote control including tv microwaves music systems and moreintegration of other appliances using the optional smart plugs plug your water heater into the smart plug and control it using aidoonline services using ifttt ​ can both projectors work at the same timeno though you can switch between the two projectors what smart device standards does aido supportaido supports zigbee dlna wifi zwave bluetooth and ir zwave support may vary as per your country together these let aido communicate with over  smart devices i have an apple homekit based setup will aido work with thisas of now aido does not support apple’s homekit we are working on the issue ballbot  movement how does the ballbot design workwe chose a ballbot design for aido’s mobility as it suited the home environment well balancing aido on a single ball means it is easy to spin around a central axis so turning aido around is much simplerwith a single ball base aido is able to move out of the way quickly if it bumps into somethingby balancing forces between aido’s body and the ball aido can navigate floors  even carpetswith software we can make sure aido is balanced when at rest or when movingaido is never really still even when it is standing it constantly equilibrates by slowly revolving the ball underneath its center of gravity if aido has to stand for an extended period of time retractable legs pop up to support aido will aido topple over if i push it hardaido counters sudden changes to its balance a tilt of more than  degrees with a set of retractable legs that spring out from the base to prevent it from keeling over push aido and the legs will spring out to provide immediate support aido will quickly try to stabilize by itself and draw the legs back in when aido is stationary for a long time it uses the legs to support itself the legs also offer support when aido is charging how does aido know where he is in the houseaido uses a combination of technologies to determine his location at home when aido is powered up the first time he fingerprints wifi signals across the house he uses wifi signal strength as the primary marker to identify different roomsaido will prompt you with list of wifi spots he identifies you can select  the wifi spots at your home and guide aido to the physical locations of the wifi acess pointsaido also uses ir and object recognition to build a topographic map of your house including elements like furniture doors   structure of rooms aido maintains these in a navigation databasebefore moving aido also does a framebyframe evaluation of the room to determine if there are moving objects or if anything has changedaido continually updates the database entries for all recognized and unrecognized obstacles how does aido navigate around home on its ownaido does a wifi scan and builds a database of wifi signals and strengths aido does not store any sensitive data like passwords or what is being communicated he only uses wifi signals to build a map of your home when you first turn him on you can setup waypoints by taking aido to various spots at home for example you can get aido to your kitchen and mark a spot as ‘kitchen’ aido stores this entry with a wifi fingerprint so it can navigate there later if requiredwhen you ask aido to navigate between rooms he builds a path between way pointsaido also uses ir and object recognition to build a topographic map of your house including elements like furniture doors   structure of rooms aido maintains these in a navigation database aido judges the space between obstacles and if it is sufficient for him to traverse will plot a path between them note aido can’t climb steps aido’s inbuilt edge detector warns him if there is a steep change in elevation ahead and he will stop before he reaches the edge how does aido avoid obstacles along the pathaido uses a combination of technologies to detect obstacles aido uses ir and object recognition to build a topographic map of your house including elements like furniture doors   structure of rooms aido maintains these in a navigation database he judges the space between obstacles and if it is sufficient for him to traverse will plot a path between themwhen you ask aido to move or if aido needs to patrol aido does a constant framebyframe visual comparison for moving objects like pets or people as well as stationary objects if aido finds a moving object nearby he will wait for it to move out of the way before proceedingaido has sophisticated edge detection built in that prevents him from spinning uselessly when he encounters an intractable obstacle like a staircase edge detection also allows aido to course correct around obstacles like chairs  tables  how does aido’s patrol mode workyou can set up waypoints or end points at home the first time you get aido home for example by setting up an end point as main door you can ask aido to get the door with a waypoint in the kitchen you can ask aido to get to the kitchen and so on once the way points are set you can set specific patrol paths as aido’s beat at specific timesaido also listens keenly to events like glass breaking or explosions and can navigate to the location and send photos and alertswe also factored in use cases where people may be walking around home or aido has to navigate around pets prancing at home aido waits for the person or pet to move out of its path in case aido is pushed accidentally aido tries selfbalancing on its base does aido work on carpets what about transitioning from hardwood floor onto a carpetaido’s ballbot can accommodate change in flooring and slight changes in elevation aido gently rolls off the carpet onto your floor security  privacy aido seems to connect with all my smart home utilities what security protocols does it support how can i be sure it will not be hackedaido uses ssl encryption to secure personal data sent to and from the cloud aido uses bit aes encryption in the cloud and digital certificates are used to authenticate devices what programming language to i need to know if i want to extend aidothe aido sdk requires knowledge of the python and c programming languages and knowledge of how to build android apps i’m concerned about how much aido will get to know about me and my home how does aido protect my privacyaido only collects data it needs keeps it encrypted and doesn’t transmit any personal data back to our servers all sensitive data like passwords are encrypted with bit aes encryption to ensure that no one can ever gain access to them aido may collect some data anonymously for purposes of improving the product you will have control of how much data aido shares with us and can turn off sharing if you like can someone watch or listen to meaido robots have cameras and microphones that are used to interact with

we started work on aido by breaking up a lot of challenges into smaller components and figuring out how to best tackle these we used a combination of three approaches for building aidoopen source instead of beginning from ground zero we scoured open source projects to see what we could adapt for aido for example aido’s core operating system runs a modified version of ubuntulicensing we scoured the research labs of universities and spoke to startups and found that we could license great technology that would work great with what we wanted to do for aido for example aido’s object recognition runs software licensed from uncanny vision with this aido can recognize over  objectscustom design we’ve also been hard at work on custom hardware and software design our team has designed custom communication interfaces between android that runs aido’s user interface and linux we’ve engaged a design firm that has years of consumer user interface design experience including some cutting edge work with the microsoft surface table as of the campaign launch date we have a lot of the foundational pieces in place while all the features in the video may not make it to the scheduled launch we will be updating aido’s software on a regular basis we will also release a rich set of apis that will help our developer community extend what aido is capable of when will i receive my aidowe plan to

robotics google unknown dec   schaft google m expert opinion summary accomplishing 9k in preorders on indegogo is certainly an impressive feat ingen dynamics has included many deal terms that are common in vc rounds but often lack in crowdfunding rounds like voting rights liquidation preferences and an established employee options pool my main concern is that aido is still very much a concept and the company does not have a working prototype the company claims to be shipping current preorders by late  but that has already been pushed back from earlier promised dates to their indegogo backers with ingen only publishing financials from  it is unknown if the capital raised from the indegogo campaign has already been spent on rd if this capital has already been spent it could create a large liability for the company the liability concern is validated by a handful of unhappy indegogo backers that have voiced growing impatience due to the shipping date being pushed back although the
