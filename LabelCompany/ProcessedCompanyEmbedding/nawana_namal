officer  director thank you juliet and thanks to all of you joining us jim will go through our financials in detail shortly but im going to focus on three key topics this afternoon first ill discuss our third quarter and yeartodate financial performance focusing mainly on revenue composition then ill review our business unit results including major product and market drivers and finally ill report our progress on key initiatives and plans that support aleres success heading into  and beyond ill be referencing some of the slides weve included in our earnings presentation available on our website beginning with our third quarter performance revenue and nongaap earnings per share were below our expectations at  million and  respectively as you can see in our earnings presentation on slide three compared to the prior year period revenue declined by  million in foreign currency exchange  million in pain management and  million in inratio  million from bbi revenue and lower sales into our consumer joint venture and  million in cd and malaria products sold in africa organic growth declined a negative  during the third quarter excluding pain management organic growth was  despite these challenges our core businesses had solid growth with increased sales in core platforms and services from a global region perspective latin america grew organically by  yearoveryear asiapacific grew  africa declined  europe declined  and north america declined by  excluding pain management north america grew by  jim will provide additional color of regional results later in the call now id like to review the business performance in each of our three core business units unless otherwise noted all growth figures are on a constant currency basis excluding acquisitions and dispositions beginning with our cardiometabolic business which grew organically by  q revenue was  million and was driven by  growth in asia and  growth in north america from a product perspective afinion continues to perform well with approximately  placements during q including large hospital placements in north america overall afinion ac grew  globally in q epoc grew  as we fulfilled backorders and began adding new customers and expanding our presence further into the emergency department and other parts of the hospital patients on testing grew  and meterbased triage grew in excess of  this growth was offset by a lower inratio in ldx cholesterol product sales our infectious disease business generated q revenue of  million dollars a  decline in organic growth the decrease in organic growth compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by a  decline in europe and a  decline in africa africa declined due to lower cd and malaria sales in the case of cd the who recommended that doctors and clinicians prioritize viral load to monitor the success of antiretroviral therapy but also acknowledged the need to include cd if viral load is not routinely available and also to help stratify risk given that point of care cd is lower cost more accessible and it provides connectivity through the cellular networks we continue to believe that our paying with  cd remains a key tool to improve health outcomes the change in guidelines has created some uncertainty in the cd market but we expect cd sales to return to growth in  secondly weve seen many opportunities to convert lab based cd testing to point of care in the hiv market malaria sales in africa have also been impacted by the timing of tender shipments which tend to fluctuate and also continued pricing pressure while we dont see pricing pressure abating in the near term we have new malaria innovations in the pipeline that we believe will help mitigate the current pricing environment and deliver better economics in the future turning now to flu global flu sales had a solid quarter with organic growth of  versus the prior year period total global flu sales in q were  million including  million in alere i the focus of our sales force in q was to get alere i in place ahead of the flu season and they did that admirably weve now achieved more than  instrument placements around the world yeartodate and we believe well exit the year with greater than  instrument placements this sets the stage nicely for future kit revenue whether its for flu strep or any other future analytes id like to take this opportunity to recognize the alere i team for a job very well done with their hard work weve added large hospital groups and networks to our alere i customer roster and we estimate the competitive conversions were  yeartodate in addition we estimate that about  of new alere i customers were doctors and clinicians who previously didnt test for flu but are now realizing the benefits of rapid molecular diagnostics at the point of care to improve patient health outcomes weve had a very positive customer response and we believe that we are well positioned to lead in the point of care molecular tests on our new multianalyte platforms importantly weve now completed the automation of our alere i manufacturing line and this coupled with scaling volumes will help substantially lower our cogs in future quarters just last quarter we added strep a to the menu the first sales in q and we now expect alere i strep sales to ramp steadily also during q we received clearance to use our alere i flu assay with viral transport medium and this additional claim enables us to better serve our hospital customers in addition we expect to enter clinical trials to expand the alere i menu with rsv in the fourth quarter of this year were also making excellent progress on c difficile and chlamydiagonorrhea as new analytes global hiv sales grew  driven by solid growth in asiapacific and strong demand for our determine combo products in the us in addition weve shipped over  million in alere q products over the past two quarters and are excited about the opportunity for this pointofcare molecular platform going forward moving now to our global toxicology business q revenue was  million a  yearoveryear decrease and was driven by pain management which declined  from the prior year period excluding pain management our core toxicology revenue grew by  during q which represents  consecutive quarters of organic growth our efforts to stabilize pain management have not yielded the desired results despite q being the first quarter to show stabilized lab volumes we continue to have payment pressure the national payer we contracted with in july has not yet ramped volume and other contracting efforts have stalled as the market awaits a final pricing determination from cms as you may be aware cms released its preliminary determination for the clinical lab fee schedule but the recommendations will not be finalized until november this remains a very turbulent period in the pain management market segment as evidenced by continued pricing pressure and numerous competitors exiting the market weve closely monitored this business and have cut costs wherever possible at the same time we have evaluated strategic alternatives to pain management throughout the year and well continue to do so pain management now represents less than  of total toxicology revenue and less than  of alere revenue switching gears to our core toxicology business organic growth drivers included our global reagents business which increased by  and employer services which grew  yearoveryear in our reagents business we achieved two additional k clearances during q including eddp a methadone metabolite and pcp a drug of abuse as you recall we previously cleared six drugs bringing our yeartodate clearances now to eight we continue to pursue key clearances to improve our portfolio and now have the building blocks to enter the regulated workplace and hospital markets we will approach this new market early in q and expect a strong launch with key laboratory and trade partners in early  in employer services we expanded our reach to more than  escreen enabled clinics adding approximately  new clinic partner locations we signed approximately  million in national account wins with large employers and third party administrators which are now working to onboard in q finally in july we announced the acquisition of us diagnostics a leading provider of drug tests in the us the integration has proceeded well and were already seeing the anticipated financial returns from this acquisition our toxicology team is looking forward to an active fourth quarter as they implement multiple product and customer wins and we still expect to return to overall revenue growth in q lastly i want to take a step back and share some thoughts with you on our progress to date and priorities going forward because in times of volatility its easy to lose sight of the bigger picture we are in the process of transforming alere to be a worldclass global enterprise weve sharpened our focus on core products removed more than  million in costs and reported three consecutive quarters of organic growth prior to the third quarter as you can see on slide four the operational discipline being exerted by the organization is evident when analyzing the trailing  months operating expense trends which normalize the seasonal revenue variance although we face significant revenue challenges in q weve demonstrated our ability to exercise strong expense management discipline which contributed to a  increase in nongaap adjusted eps compared to the prior year period yeartodate we delivered nongaap adjusted eps of  per diluted share from continuing operations and organic growth of  as we continue to focus our business on rapid diagnostics we are pleased to report that we are on track to close the bbi divestiture this quarter and we remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet and redeploying capital appropriately we continue to pursue the divestiture of spd a consumer joint venture with pg and the litigation we discussed previously is now progressing in a positive direction for spd based on these developments we expect to move forward with the spd disposition in  we also continue to pursue the divestiture of other noncore assets to reduce our debt with that as a backdrop ill provide our revised guidance based on our current business outlook we expect  revenue to be in the range of  to  billion dollars and nongaap adjusted eps of between  and  per diluted share full year adjusted nongaap eps growth year on year would therefore be in the  to  range finally looking longer term we believe the financial thesis for alere remains fully intact weve done the checks and firmly believe that our markets are still growing organically in the midsingle digits and we fully expect to return the company to organic revenue growth in q and next year further between product mix and a multitude of margin enhancement projects there are significant multiyear leverage opportunities throughout our pl and now ill turn the call over to jim james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president okay thanks very much namal good evening everyone ive got two topics that i want to cover today first ill review the third quarter financials ill provide color on various drivers and then ill discuss some of the key financial initiatives that are underway to improve long term profitability at alere but before i get into the details i want to stop and give you what i think are the three key financial takeaways from the third quarter first and most obviously third quarter revenue and therefore earnings were below our expectations the primary drivers of this revenue shortfall were misses in africa asia and a few of our noncore soon to be divested businesses we understand these misses and do expect to bounce back in the fourth quarter which ill describe shortly second is the restructuring and cost base improvements that the team instituted last year continued to yield measurable and visible results and we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter with operating expense discipline driving strong leverage to the bottom line for the full year this phenomena will persist despite lower than expected revenues and finally weve reset our fourth quarter and full year  expectations which are very achievable and were pushing very hard to finish the year strong with positive momentum going into  so moving to the third quarter numbers please note that ill be discussing nongaap results unless otherwise specified and for comparison purposes youll find a full reconciliation from gaap to nongaap in our third quarter  press release on the investor relations section of our website net revenue for the third quarter was  million that compares to  million in the prior year period the  or  million yearonyear decrease was primarily driven by a negative foreign exchange impact of  million a  million decrease in pain management  million in lower sales of bbi and sales into our consumer joint venture and  million in cd and malaria sales in africa partly offsetting these declines were yearonyear increases in cardiac markers patient selftesting afinion epoc and core toxicology if we look beyond the yearonyear variances i suspect that many are asking what changed for the third quarter versus what we expected  days ago as i noted in my summary comments the shortfall versus our recent expectations came primarily from africa asia and select noncore businesses more specifically in africa as namal mentioned changing cd guidelines as well as delayed tenders and price competition in the malaria market hurt third quarter sales we do expect fourth quarter to be a much stronger number in africa with cd and malaria products bouncing back a bit and sales of hiv products filling the rest of the gap with respect to asia the shortfall in china was driven by economic volatility which caused some distributor destocking korea has the hangover effect of the mers outbreak which dampened overall utilization in that country notwithstanding those issues we expect q to be a much better overall number in asia with china japan and india leading the way and finally looking at our noncore or other revenue the shortfall was primarily due to sales in our consumer jv which carry very low margins and bbi revenue declines as you know this business is scheduled to be divested later this quarter continuing with third quarter revenue professional diagnostic revenue of  million was comprised of  million in cardiometabolic disease  million in infectious disease  million in toxicology  million in other revenue which reflected the divestiture of bionote dgp and alere analytics consumer diagnostic revenue was  million and license and royalty revenue was  million in the third quarter from a geographic split standpoint  of our revenue from the quarter came from north america  from europe  from asiapacific and  from the rest of the world now looking at gross margins adjusted gross profit was  million with a  gross margin in the quarter that compares to  million with a  gross margin in the year ago period the two biggest headwinds by far continue to be foreign exchange especially the significant negative currency moves we saw in latin america and asia and product mix again primarily due to lower contribution from the high margin pain management business these are the same trends weve been discussing all year and compared to the second quarter gross margin remained relatively stable sequentially looking at expenses adjusted operating expenses totaled  million  of net revenue thats down  year on year adjusted operating expenses were comprised of  million in rd and  million in sga which were  and  of revenue respectively the modest increase that we saw in rd from the second quarter run rate was expected and reflects continued build out of project management capability and investment in our critical projects sga went down quarter over quarter primarily as a result of lower incentive compensation expense and continued cost controls around discretionary spend on things like travel and expenses as well as consultants moving down to pl adjusted operating income was  million in the third quarter a  year on year decline and adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was  of net revenue adjusted interest and other expense was  million in the third quarter versus  million last year driven by lower interest expense from debt pay down and our june refinancing as well as realized foreign exchange losses that did not repeat this year those were losses from last year adjusted ebitda in the third quarter was  million and our third quarter adjusted tax rate was  largely in line with our expectations and significantly below last years rate finishing up on the pl thanks to the lower interest and tax expense adjusted net income from continuing operations increased  year on year to  million or  per diluted share with diluted common shares outstanding at the end of the quarter of  million turning to balance sheet and cash flow as of september  we had  million in cash  billion of debt net of cash operating cash flow for the third quarter was  million free cash flow was  million this is an improvement over the first half of the year as a result of higher net and continued focus on better working capital management were still a bit behind last year though and we continue to push to get our full year freecash flow number even with last years number of approximately  million as a reminder this is a high bar as it includes cash flow from discontinued operations of approximately  million finally as namal said we expect bbi to close shortly and that should bring in another  million of cash in the fourth quarter now looking toward the fourth quarter and the full year namal provided our revised guidance range of approximately  billion to  billion on the top line and between  and  nongaap adjusted earnings per diluted share although we only provide annual financial guidance at this stage in the year with only one quarter remaining it seems reasonable that we do the math and tell you that our full year guidance implies fourth quarter revenue in the range of  million to  million and our nongaap adjusted earnings per diluted share of  to  in the fourth quarter now although these results in the fourth quarter are a step up from q which reflects normal seasonality at alere theyre clearly achievable and we feel weve got good line of sight to them were approaching the fourth quarter aggressively to help ensure that we achieve these results more specifically both namal and i are personally taking steps to ensure resources and direction of alere of the key markets that will make or break the fourth quarter in addition we are proactively targeting discretionary spend with reductions in travel and expenses outside consulting and nonrevenue generating new hires now as i mentioned i want to finish by sharing some thoughts on the longer term underlying cost drivers and the potential for continued enterprise light profit improvement last quarter i said that we see the potential to systematically remove tens of millions of dollars in cost over time as we simplify alere and manage the company as one global enterprise and since then weve continued to work on these opportunities which will come through strategic initiatives in things like pricing global procurement it and corporate infrastructure simplification our internal operating and service delivery models better treasury and tax planning and a host of other things now these are obviously multiyear initiatives but weve already realized some small quick wins in a number of these weve built capabilities and made changes to the way we look at pricing and discounting weve hired a chief procurement officer and initiated a true global strategic sourcing effort weve consolidated and now have access to tens of millions of dollars in cash and we brought in a new tax leader and team to build our internal tax accounting and planning capabilities which we expect will drive better long term results we expect all these things to contribute meaningfully to our results in  and beyond most importantly weve initiated work on a broader corporate wide simplification project designed to find complexity and drive it out of the organization we believe this effort will benefit all of our stakeholders by making it easier for our customers to do business with us and ultimately drive a more profitable enterprise for our shareholders were in the early stages of this journey and we plan to share our longer term targets and metrics as a result of this work in early  finally i want to take the opportunity to thank all the alere employees around the globe for their hard work and helping us achieve the vision for alere without the great people here none of what were trying to do would be possible and so with that i think we can open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you sir we will now begin the question and answer session first question comes from bill bonello from craighallum please go ahead sir william bishop bonello  craighallum capital group llc yeah good afternoon jim so just trying to understand a little bit more some of the moving parts in the quarter as how youre thinking about them going forward when you ran through a litany of things that were worse than expected in terms of revenue but on a number of those things you said you expected them to get better in the fourth quarter the fourth quarter guidance doesnt seem to imply a lot of improvement no growth really yearoveryear i guess what im trying to understand is should we – to what extent should we be thinking about this q as an anomaly related to timing and some of the other factors that you related versus a new base of which we should be thinking about sequential and yearoveryear growth going forward and then i have a followup question namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director so first of all thanks bill let me start and then im sure jim will add a couple of things here so we did have some discrete areas which performed worse than our expectations and certainly even late into the quarter we expected them to do better than they actually ended up delivering particularly africa and asia in this case i think you know weve had pain management and inratio as headwinds throughout the year pain management we had thought would remediate more than it did in q ultimately we signed a national payer but – and we stabilized volumes but we certainly didnt see the actual payments come through in any significant way so we had price pressure essentially there so thinking about the moving parts going forward i think again we feel good about our africa business having a stronger q we have good line of sight to the pipeline of contracts and tenders there and so that seems to be something that should flow back in q we also see asia accelerating again i think we had great growth in india again in q but china was at a much lower level than usual  growth a lot of turbulence in that marketplace during the quarter and we do anticipate that will come back i think the broader question is how do we get to the midsingle digit growth of our markets and thats something we feel again good about getting to during the course of  but we still have some of these headwinds persisting in q so were being i think naturally conservative after the q results with respect to our q expectations we certainly want to deliver at stronger organic growth levels but i think that wed be looking into  for that now jim do you want to add anything james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president no i think thats pretty much summarized one thing id say bill is you know the things that we identified those three critical things they were – theyre pretty compartmentalized we have good visibility in them we do expect a bounce back in the fourth quarter in terms of growth in the fourth quarter we do expect to grow the company organically in the fourth quarter which we did not do in the third so were going to be getting back to organic growth much like we did in the first and the second quarter and you can see what our guidance range implies william bishop bonello  craighallum capital group llc okay so you do expect positive organic growth in the fourth quarter okay that – and then just to follow up i mean are any of these issues at all related or fallout potentially from any of the costsaving initiatives that have gone on and is there anywhere where now looking at it you have perhaps underinvested or overcut or are they really more macro environmental issues versus operational issues namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director so first of all no i dont think they relate to the cost saving measures weve taken which again were very specific a lot coming in rd initially as well as in ga functions and i think that again they captured in fairly discrete areas weve got africa where weve actually invested in feet on the street and we do anticipate growth going forward really related to two product groups cd and malaria there and then in asia which i think is much more timing oriented and thats i think a q issue more than anything else we have won tenders which we anticipate will drive growth going forward so i dont think its a question of us under investing i think that weve still got actually much more opportunity on the opex line going forward and we will make select investments for growth in all of our geographies based on our normal business planning process which really is underway at the moment and finalizes as we get through the year william bishop bonello  craighallum capital group llc okay thanks namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director thanks a lot bill operator and our next question comes from isaac ro from goldman sachs please go ahead isaac ro  goldman sachs  co good evening thanks for taking the question jim i wanted to sort of ask a similar question in a different way which is to say you guys are obviously making a series of important investments in the infrastructure of the company a lot of it will hopefully improve forecasting if you were to maybe hypothetically imagine a world where you had a lot of this infrastructure in place is it fair to say that a lot of the issues that caught you by surprise this quarter couldve been maybe more visible im just trying to get a sense of the extent to which you think that what happened this quarter was a function of just not having the controls you need in place to forecast effectively james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president okay great question isaac thanks and i think the short answer – i mean a couple things first is the word control has a very specific meaning in finance and so i think we have a well controlled close and a well controlled financial reporting process when it comes to forecasting thats a different matter and so lets talk about forecast accuracy i will tell you that this company has been run for a long long time with a series of smaller entities that rolled up and so therefore the information flow was sometimes scattered we are in the process as namal and i have talked about of converting to more of a global view and a global enterprise view of things weve instituted a number of new processes in place that i think makes it better and so a couple months ago we instituted a monthly financial review with all the executives and all the finance leadership that probes much more deeply into the monthly results and what that means for the forecast and that was like i said instituted just a short time ago it was not part of the q forecasting process and so i think were getting better on that front i think the information flow is definitely getting better globally and so i think the short answer to your question is as we continue to invest in some of these global infrastructure type things and as we continue to look at the company more globally we will have better visibility i also will tell you though within two or three weeks of the quarter ending we were still contemplating a much higher revenue number than got reported and a couple of these last – a couple of things changed in the last two or three weeks of the quarter that took the number down below well below what we were expecting even with only a few weeks left so that was definitely a change towards the end of the quarter that possibly couldve been picked up but not sure – it was better infrastructure but not sure that we wouldve been able to do too much about it at that point the longwinded way of saying yes we are investing yes our visibility is getting better its better now than it was six months ago or a year ago and it will get better over the course of the next couple of quarters the last thing ill say is very tactically that sometimes not having great harmonized systems is an excuse that should not be an excuse we are absolutely using what i describe as good oldfashioned persontoperson contact and namal and i are participating on weekly calls with many of the gotomarket leaders in the regions that are very important for us to make our fourth quarter and were staying very tightly abreast of whats happening in each of those regions so were trying to make up for it with just a little bit of oldfashioned discussion namal anything to add namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director look i think you covered it but one thing i would add is id emphasize the accountability we – this is not the revenue result we were planning for and in real terms had we achieved just flat organic growth i think we wouldve delivered and overdelivered on our earnings calls and so the miss is very disappointing i think it is – we understand it i think the team is extremely engaged in reversing this and getting to market growth which we absolutely believe we can deliver so i think as much as the forecasting is an area of opportunity for us to improve the biggest area is actually delivering and delivering the performance and as we planned our financial year we certainly did not plan for going backwards in this quarter and i think we have to be accountable to that and again in terms of managing risk for our company and making sure that we can be there we had anticipated at least flat ill say more than that but at least flat had we got to at least flat i think that the earnings result wouldve been certainly in line so thats all i would add there isaac isaac ro  goldman sachs  co hey i appreciate all the color thats very helpful maybe one followup more tactically on the infectious disease business you guys didnt call out flu obviously the trend that weve seen elsewhere in the industry quarter to date suggests sort of a soso quarter can you comment on if that presented  a tough comp or a headwind for infectious disease thank you namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director so great question weve seen some of the reporting there is the ghx reporting that occurs november thish so well see formally then on market shares et cetera now from my standpoint were tracking pretty much how we expected to in flu our focus in this quarter was really around getting our alere i asset in place i think we did that very very well we now have over  alere is placed ahead of the flu season so what youre seeing in the flu market at the moment is really customers preparing for the flu season and buying in to have the necessary stocks on their shelves for us that was a fairly normal quarter yes we had  growth overall but its about the same when you add the alere i flu in as what we experienced last year so rather than – the only shift we anticipate is that as q and q come around in a normal flu season scenario we anticipate doing a little better with alere i out there and that is certainly something we would forecast but in terms of the size of the flu season were not calling the size of flu season typically we have to wait until kind of week  to see whether theres been an inflection in the reported rates if we havent seen it by about week  then we tend to think that its going to be a lighter season but until then we dont really call it operator our next question comes from dane leone from btig please go ahead dane dane leone  btig llc hi guys thanks for taking my questions i do appreciate the level of detail given the challenging quarter when we break down the revenue misses it seems like the consumer business is on the track to be divested by bbi on the track to be divested really within the core areas its mostly in the cd and the malaria business can you help us kind of differentiate the confidence that you have in some of the core businesses rebounding in the fourth quarter against the commentary that you gave that you guys were caught off guard in the last two to three weeks of the third quarter so what i mean by that is youre obviously looking at trends for the first month of the fourth quarter to give you confidence that you can hit the numbers that you just laid out how does that differentiate then being caught off guard perhaps late in the quarter versus your expectations namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director its a great question dane let me get you started on this and jim can add yes bbi is being divested though were a little shorter than we expected this quarter and as was spd heading into q as we look on a sequential basis so kind of bridging up from our q results to our q anticipated result we do anticipate the flu will have a bigger part in that quarter that financial cycle i think everyone knows that we also anticipate a rebound in africa thats only going to be a moderate rebound in cd and malaria we think really cd will be  to get back to the kind of growth that we had been experiencing but hiv has been doing really really well for us were at  yeartodate growth in our hiv screening and thats really on the back of both determine and well as that fantastic launch for determine combo in the us where weve been seeing really wonderful success so hiv i think the screening business will do well in q and heading forward and  growth on our epoc range in q is good growth its not as good as we think it should be and so we think that that will contribute more in q a lot of good opportunities for our sales organization at the moment so i think a lot of focus on alere i i think in q weve already really got alere i set where we want it and anticipating about  placements by the end of the year but epoc i think is a big opportunity great momentum in afinion  growth for our  that continues to really drive and then core toxicology you know  growth in the quarter obviously with pain management its a real bit of a downer overall but the core toxicology is  straight quarters of good growth good organic growth and again we anticipate particularly reagents and employer services doing well into q so id say across the board many of our core platforms did perform in q and many of our plans most of our plans were well executed in q but these areas that did surprise us were of significant enough size that were now overcome in the quarter but q id say theyre the key things i call out any i missed james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president i wouldnt add to the detail i think thats right in terms of where the pockets of growth are going to come from and where the rebound is going to come from and we said that in our script and then again in this answer i think one of the things you asked about was how do we avoid a surprise and so as i mentioned were much more involved just personally involved in these things and youd be amazed at the kind – what were trying to do actually is derisk the month of december and try to drive as much sales as we can into the early part of the quarter certainly we are part of the way through the fourth quarter and the guidance weve given reflects our insights into the quarter thus far and then the last thing id say is again the personal involvement youd be surprised or amazed or maybe you wouldnt on when the ceo is the personally involved in talking to country managers and sales leaders about how theyre doing the sense of urgency lifts and so i think thats an important component as well not to say that its not always urgent not to say that were not in touch with it all the time but when youre doing something every week and the ceo is touching people every single week it just creates a heightened sense of awareness that i think is important right now for the company so between the detail that namal gave and the product rebounds and the process that were implementing i think youve got a little bit of color as to how were hoping the fourth quarter is considerably better than the third dane leone  btig llc great color maybe just one followup on china given this lower sales growth there i think you guys mentioned specifically it was distributor inventory destocking what did you see in sell out versus sell in so where the sell out rates were good that maybe the sell in was just a temporal response to reduce some inventory levels and then things will go back to normal james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president so i dont have that number directly in front of me but when we spoke to the country manager and the region manager we were – it was very clear that the economic uncertainty that has prevailed in china while they dont believe that theres a fundamental reduction in demand for our products its pretty clear that some of these distributors many of whom are smaller distributors are not eager to outlay capital to buy inventory and in fact are bleeding inventory down so i dont have the exact in versus sell in versus sell out number in front of me but that was a very clear topic of great discussion in our discussion with them about their quarterly results namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director and i have made comments about china and alere in the past and ill make them again which is i think that what china needs alere has relevant products and we are underpenetrated overall so i think our outlook on an annual basis for china always remains positive and on a goforward basis also and were still at early stages with new assets like epoc in that market so i think were in the process of just changing the profile of how we derive our revenue how we access our customers in china and im confident that our team there will do well over time and build our capability dane leone  btig llc thank you operator our next question comes from anthony petrone from jefferies please go ahead anthony charles petrone  jefferies llc great thanks and good afternoon maybe just a couple to jump in again on cd and malaria if im hearing you correctly either namal or jim on the malaria side specifically it sounds like there was a combination of share shift but perhaps slippage so is part of the malaria experience in the quarter was that actually slippage and do you expect to get that back in the fourth quarter and then just on other revenue im just wondering if you can break out what the impact of moving to discontinued operations is on that line item and so is this sort of the run rate that we should expect going forward and then just one followup on eps thanks namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director so i think well just jump in and out here jim but for malaria i think there was a little bit of slippage in the quarter and well see a little bit change in q but i would say the main thing is that we have lost price in malaria and that price pressure is relevant to understand its probably a little more than we anticipated and i think most importantly we wouldve anticipated a bigger offset of incoming volume to offset that price in our initial plans and so what is our outlook going forward again i would say the need for malaria tests is great you know theres still so much to do in that field and i think that volumes will continue to go up over the coming months and years and equally from our standpoint were part of the process which is trying to eradicate that disease over a longer time horizon but to do that you need a more higher sensitivity test so i think the real thing is to solve the problem we need to have better tests were in the process of doing that and its not too down in the future where well have a new product with a different price i think to address that market in the short term i think continued pricing pressure but offset by volume so our job is to make sure that were winning the tenders and bringing in the volume and for the remainder of the questions james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president on other revenue right anthony and what anthony charles petrone  jefferies llc yeah correct on discontinued ops is this sort of the run rate we should expect going forward james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so that other revenue category the one that we reported about  million which was down about  million yearonyear that – its actually not a disc ops line its basically just sort of a mish mash of assorted things that dont fit anywhere else and many of those to your very good point are in the process of being divested and so that line will likely continue to shrink so if you look at the  million we reported that has got some obvious negative pressure from divestitures of businesses that were in last years results that arent in this years results in addition it contains bbi which will close in the fourth quarter so it will decline even further from that number into the fourth quarter and then as we continue to divest smaller businesses that that line will continue to shrink probably well definitely through  so i actually dont have a very precise estimate to give you for the fourth quarter because it depends a lot on when we actually close the bbi transaction but it will definitely be lower in the fourth quarter anthony charles petrone  jefferies llc thats helpful then just the last one in the eps guide it seems that the prior range was sort of  to  a lot of moving parts on divestitures and then the issues in infectious disease im just wondering if you could sort of quantify what is divested businesses in that eps shift versus what occurred in the underlying business thanks again james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so theres a couple of moving parts as you suggested the divestiture of bbi and then the offset with the acquisition of usd which was an acquisition we closed in july so i think netnet again not knowing precisely when bbi will close there is somewhere on the net of those two is somewhere between a  and  loss of eps to the company in this years number and thats the only significant divestiture that would impact the guidance this year those net namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director and the reason for the bbi one contributing to that q i think decline further relates to its performance also which is understood understood by the potential acquirer and – but measurable to the earlier point on the disc ops i think weve done the appropriate cleanup of the business and i think its – we feel good about the measures taken so a small business like bionote that we sold last year they do contribute to a revenue decline other small businesses like our german health management business they did have some revenue attached to them some significant revenue attached but they did not have a lot of earnings attached to them so weve been able to protect i think the earnings line well despite some of those decisions anthony charles petrone  jefferies llc thanks again operator and our next question comes from nicholas jansen from raymond james please go ahead sir nicholas m jansen  raymond james  associates inc hey guys a lot of my questions have been answered but thinking about that new range of  to  if bbi is only out for two months of that quarter and youre talking about  or  of potential dilution whats the base that we should be thinking about to grow our models for  to make sure that were thinking about that appropriately because the fear would be growth off of a number thats not quite the real number as the portfolio will be constructed for  james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president great great question obviously well provide you that kind of reconciliation as we get towards the end of the year the one thing i will tell you is bbis performance is backend loaded and so a lot of their earnings do come in towards the end of the year thats what weve seen traditionally out of them and so actually losing them in novemberdecember has a disproportionate share its not like onesixth of their contribution goes away its something more than that in general so again i think if you think about yearonyear what we might be losing if you took that number that i gave you and kind of doubled it and said that might be a starting place that might be a good starting place were going to give you a much more detailed reconciliation when we give guidance next year for the full year of  okay nicholas m jansen  raymond james  associates inc okay and then secondly looking at some of the disclosures between segment gross profit margins it actually looked like your other businesses and corporate had negative gross margin if i – or gross profit dollars if im reading this correctly because it looked like the professional diagnostic segment at least according to the reconciliation had about  million of gp but the entire company had  million and historically thats not the case usually the pdx  number is slightly below the consolidated number so was there something in there that we should be thinking about james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president you know what nick let me and juliet take that and dig into it and get you an answer back i dont have that at the tip of my tongue right now the split of gross margin and expenses between the segments is largely allocation based and so answering it on the fly is probably not the best thing here why dont we – juliet and i will take that question well dig into it and well get you an answer just as quick as we can nicholas m jansen  raymond james  associates inc great and then just two quick ones more given the size of the delta relative to the kind of existing guidance did you guys think at all about preannouncing considering the level of miss here or were you trying to figure out what october looked like to give you a better sense of how to come out with guidance james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah thats a great question we did discuss it you know i think the conclusion was when you have a miss you want to make sure youve got the best possible information both on the reasons for the miss and also what it means going forward and so we used all of the time to the best of our ability to figure that out we spent a lot of time talking to the regional leaders a lot of time talking to the business – global business unit leaders and a lot of time pressure testing both our short term and long term assumptions about this business and a lot of time looking at what we can do on the expense line and also more time in october to try to get a sense of where the quarter was going so i just gave a longwinded answer to your assumption which is yeah we wanted to take as much time as we could to get the best information possible and thats why we chose to take it all the way up to the normal earnings release date nicholas m jansen  raymond james  associates inc okay and then lastly in terms of the initiatives that jim you started to embark on or the whole team started to embark on regarding margin improvements strategic pricing tax planning if we think about those impacts over the next kind of three years how should we be thinking about the quarterly allocation of that i know youll probably give more in depth color when you guys are at the jpmorgan conference or at an analyst day at some point in the first quarter but just wanted to get a better sense of the cadence of the margin improvement that you think is inherent in this business because clearly with the reset today i think investors would try to hope that we dont have another reset happening in a couple months thanks james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah thats a great question i think im going to defer until weve got a deeper laid back project expectations on our three year strategic plan which were in the process of working through right now as well as our  budget which were in the process of working on now so a lot of moving parts here inside the company and well have way better information on all of those things in  days or  days the one thing i would tell you just to temper expectations i would not expect that well give you sort of quarterly cadence on when well see margin rollout i think what wed like to do is give you long term targets and then measure progress against them and thats kind of the way i think wed like to handle it but at the very least hopefully early next year youll get some of those longer term targets nicholas m jansen  raymond james  associates inc thank you james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president yep operator and our next question comes from zarak khurshid from wedbush securities please go ahead zarak khurshid  wedbush securities inc hi there everyone thanks for taking the questions i have a multiparter on malaria to start we havent heard too much about that business over the years i was just wondering if you could break out how large of a business is that for you whats sort of the underlying organic growth that youve seen whats the nature of the pricing pressure there is it essentially government purchasers that play various vendors off of each other to secure better pricing or is there some other dynamic namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director yes so malaria has been a growing business for us we experienced really strong growth last year and i think thats one of the issues here is the massive tender wins last year and strong comparables but since then i think that theres also been a response from our competitors in the marketplace and also specifically with respect to price so this year what were seeing is that volume growth being tapped and the price pressure being much more acute so i would say that the outlook remains one of strong volume growth based on need and the – and continued price pressure in the near term with respect to competitors trying to maintain a business we have – this is a sizable business for us on any given quarter and during the course of last year i think were probably north of  million in malaria tests id have to check the exact number zarak khurshid  wedbush securities inc thanks for that color and then you talk about your continued optimism around organic growth given the reset to the eps guidance here whats your view on the free cash flow is that being impacted more or less than the eps here and any color on free cash flow going forward would be helpful james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i think the short answer is its probably being impacted less i think the free cash flow opportunity – obviously net drives free cash flow theres a couple of things going on in free cash flow one is obviously when eps comes down net comes down but the corresponding opportunity around better inventory better receivable management i think overshadows that and so i think we still have an opportunity and you see we did not come off our cash flow target for this year were actually – again one of the things we did to prepare for this is okay are we still on track with our free cash flow number and again weve instituted a cash flow forecasting process and weve got visibility – trying to get better visibility into it and we did not come off it because we do believe we can still get to that approximately  million free cash flow number so again obviously when net comes down cash flow comes down but i do think weve got the opportunity to offset some of that the other thing – the other component of free cash flow is in addition to operating cash flow is obviously capital expenditures capex is a little bit lower and weve got control over capex than we expected so far yeartodate and weve got control over the – obviously what we spend in the fourth quarter and so capex will be slightly favorable to our plans as well and thatll help drive free cash flow so those working capital and capex combined should offset the negative impact of the eps takedown and free cash flow feels like its going to be where we thought it was going to be zarak khurshid  wedbush securities inc got you thanks jim james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah operator and our next question comes from mark massaro from canaccord please go ahead sir mark massaro  canaccord genuity inc hey guys thanks for taking the question and i apologize if i missed a good portion of this call in the press release you talked about some of the tenders taking longer to ramp in africa and asia how much of that do you expect will contribute to q revenues thats my first question namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director yes so firstly one of the tenders for africa is of such size that it really was a major issue for us in our q number in terms of what wed expect it to begin to contribute i think that one is pushed out probably into  at this stage its a cd tender so weve been anticipating that and weve been actually bringing the customer on board so it is a win but it is going to be a longer to ramp up so i think thats the most significant one there have been other tenders i think also just the buying patterns in africa are such that people do sometimes hedge in mind of when they want certain of their deliveries  and so we see that volatility so i think that theres a moderate impact in improving q i think for cd it really is being pushed out into  now mark massaro  canaccord genuity inc okay and youre not the first company to talk about some softness in europe can you just maybe characterize what the month of october was like in europe and any signs of stabilizing or do you think it will remain an uncertain environment james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president this is jim i dont think we want to be in a position where were sort of commenting on intraquarter results we can talk a little bit about what happened in the third quarter and that was overall softness which youve heard and in particular in some of our distributed products and namal can comment on that but i dont think we should be commenting on anything intra quarter go ahead namal namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director we did i think relatively well in europe in the prior few quarters and so again coming off that into this quarter i would say that europe goes on holiday in july and august and in our case they didnt come back from holiday in september so just – it has been worse than usual i think hitting going forward i dont think were going to be bouncing back here in europe to strong growth soon and i think thats what we have to deal with as a business is planning appropriately for a region which is probably going to take some further time we do have some new assets and there are some positive trends particularly with products like afinion and epoc but – and again on an overall basis its – were just – i think we have to manage through a challenged region i think most challenging of all has been the currency degradation on top of what has now turned into organic decline so i dont see a flip back for europe i think we as a business are relying much more on the growth we expect in asia and also we dont expect africa to be anything but a short term issue james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president okay i just wanted to add to that which i just want to sort of put an emphasis on the point we dont one of the things that you asked about sort of inter quarter information obviously were not going to give that but when it comes to what are we planning for in q we are not planning at all for any sort of significant snap back in europe its one of the areas that we dont expect to snap back in the fourth quarter so nothing heroic planned in europe for us to hit our numbers mark massaro  canaccord genuity inc okay thanks thats helpful and can you maybe comment on whether or not you think its possible to approach the organic growth rate you had in q obviously you had a lot of things contribute in q but just as we think about the fourth quarter is it reasonable to expect a low singledigit organic growth rate namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director well the range weve provided is very low and i think that were conservative in our thinking around q at this stage as weve articulated for revenue i think that beyond q and heading into  certainly confidence is much greater that were going to get to good growth and i think the team really wants to perform the team understands what its going to take to perform and so i think we just have to go and get it done so q does not plan for a big bounce in our organic growth but heading into next year i think theres a lot of things that are going well for us and some of these headwinds do turn off basically because theyre down to zero in some cases so i think naturally we anticipate things like epoc afinion triage alere i those things starting to contribute positively and less headwinds offsetting them james f hinrichs  chief financial officer  executive vice president afraid were kind of past the hour here so if thats okay i think were going to hand it back to namal hes going to make some final comments and then well deal with any final other questions on a oneonone with people go ahead namal namal nawana  president chief executive officer  director okay thanks jim so look i think its fair to say the revenue in the quarter was not what we were planning but we did continue to progress as an organization i think we are becoming a stronger organization every quarter we had strong operating discipline which drove  of earnings which is again a strong improvement over prior year but also on the basis of the revenue delivered quite a good result i think most importantly we do have a clear line of sight of restoring organic growth moderately in q but accelerating in  and with our revised guidance of  to  in earnings per share that still represents roughly  earnings per share growth this year for full year which i think is again one of our biggest areas of focus is delivering strong financials heading into  so thank you very much for your interest and i look forward to speaking with you again soon byebye operator the conference has now concluded thank you for attending
