shareholder although the markets were fairly positive in  no one can predict what lies ahead for investors the previous year stocks posted belowaverage returns and bonds had one of the worst years in history this downturn followed a period in which the investing environment was almost ideal these market ups and downs are a normal part of investing and there are some basic principles that can help investors in every type of market first take a longterm approach when investing if you can afford to leave your money invested through the inevitable ups and downs of financial markets you will greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline over time for example stock prices have gone up  and have significantly outperformed other types of investments and stayed ahead of inflation second you can further manage risk by diversifying your investments a stock mutual fund is already diversified because it invests in many different companies you can increase your diversification by investing in a number of different stock funds or in different investment categories such as bonds you should also keep money youll need in the near future in a more stable investment finally it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan investing a set amount of money at the same time each month or quarter that way you can avoid getting caught up in the excitement of a rapidlyrising market  and wont end up buying all your shares at market highs this strategy wont assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market but it should help you lower the average cost of your purchases for this to be effective you must continue to buy shares in both up and down markets if you have questions please call us at  we would be happy to send you a fidelity fundmatch kit which can help you determine the mix of investments that is right for you you might also find it convenient to set up a regular investment plan using the fidelity automatic account buildersm we look forward to hearing from you best regards edward c johnson d performance the bottom line to measure a money market funds performance you can look at either total return or yield total return reflects the change in a funds share price over a given period reinvestment of its dividends or income and the effect of the funds  account closeout fee on an average sized account yield measures the income paid by a fund since a money market fund tries to maintain a  share price yield is an important measure of performance if fidelity had not reimbursed the fund for certain expenses during the periods shown the total returns would have been lower cumulative total returns periods ended april   past  past  past  life of months year years fund spartan new jersey municipal money market fund     new jersey taxfree money market funds average    na cumulative total returns show the funds performance in percentage terms over a specific period  in this case six months one year five years or since the fund started on may   for example if you invested  in a fund that had a  return over the past year the value of your investment would be  to measure how the funds performance stacked up against its peers you can compare it to the new jersey taxfree money market funds average which reflects the performance of  new jersey taxfree money market funds with similar objectives tracked by ibc financial data inc over the past six months the periods covered by ibc financial data inc numbers are the closest available match to those covered by the fund average annual total returns periods ended april   past  past  life of year years fund spartan new jersey municipal money market fund    new jersey taxfree money market funds average   na average annual total returns take the funds actual or cumulative return and show you what would have happened if the fund had performed at a constant rate each year yields      spartan new jersey      municipal money market if fidelity had not      reimbursed certain fund expenses new jersey      taxfree money market funds average spartan new jersey      municipal money market  taxequivalent if fidelity had not      reimbursed certain fund expenses yield refers to the income paid by the fund over a given period yields for money market funds are usually for sevenday periods expressed as annual percentage rates a yield that assumes income earned is reinvested or compounded is called an effective yield the chart above shows the funds current sevenday yield at quarterly intervals over the past year if the adviser had not reimbursed certain fund expenses during the periods shown the yields would have been lower you can compare these yields to the new jersey taxfree money market funds average as tracked by ibc financial data inc or you can look at the funds taxequivalent yield which is based on a combined effective  federal and state income tax rate of  a portion of the funds income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax a money market funds total returns and yields will vary and reflect past results rather than predict future performance comparing performance yields on taxfree investments are usually lower than yields on taxable investments however a straight comparison between the two may be misleading because it ignores the way taxes reduce taxable returns taxequivalent yield  the yield youd have to earn on a similar taxable investment to match the taxfree yield  makes the comparison more meaningful keep in mind that the us government neither insures nor guarantees a money market fund in fact there is no assurance that a money market fund will maintain a  share price checkmark fund talk the managers overview an interview with jeff parker portfolio manager of spartan new jersey municipal money market fund q jeff how has the investment climate changed during the past six months a theres been quite a turnaround in market sentiment in recent months when the period began the federal reserve was in an easing mode having lowered the federal funds rate  the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans  the previous july with inflation under control congress and the white house apparently making progress toward a balanced budget agreement and the economy losing steam many market participants believed it was only a matter of time before the fed cut interest rates again it therefore came as no surprise when the fed lowered the federal funds rate onequarter percentage point in early december and lowered it again by an equal amount on the last day of january  heading into spring it appeared likely the rate cuts would continue q has that scenario changed a yes when fed chairman alan greenspan testifying before congress in midfebruary seemed to suggest that the economy was basically sound the consensus shifted and rates backed up then came the infamous february employment report which was significantly stronger than most analysts had predicted since then a string of positive indicators has left little doubt in most analysts minds that for the time being the economy is in no need of further stimulus q how did you respond to changing conditions a the fund began the period with an average maturity of  days in a decliningrate environment it usually makes sense to lock in attractive rates for as long as possible by extending the funds average maturity as evidence mounted that the economy was not as weak as we had thought i sought greater flexibility by reducing the funds average maturity by the time the february employment report was released in early march the funds average maturity was already in the mid s since then ive gradually rolled down ending the period at  days q how did the fund perform a the funds sevenday yield on april   was  compared to  on october   the latest yield was the equivalent of a taxable yield of  for investors in the  combined federal and state tax bracket the funds total return during the sixmonth period was  that beat the total return of  for the new jersey taxfree money market funds average according to ibc financial data inc the fund also outperformed its peers over the past  months  compared to  q whats the outlook a recently released economic indicators have produced some contradictory signals making it unclear just how strong the economy really is in the absence of compelling evidence one way or the other i think its likely the fed will stand pat for a while certainly no one expects the fed to lower rates again anytime soon on the other hand there have been ominous signs of growing inflationary pressures in recent months and if we continue to see evidence of strong economic performance in key indicators such as employment housing and consumer spending it is more likely that the fed will choose to raise rates perhaps sometime during the third quarter but again no one has a very clear sense of what to expect over the next couple of months given the lack of a solid direction ill probably aim to keep the funds average maturity about where it is right now  between  and  days that gives me maximum flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and take advantage of buying opportunities as they arise the views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover the managers views are subject to change at any time based

message dear shareholder although the markets were fairly positive in  no one can predict what lies ahead for investors the previous year stocks posted belowaverage returns and bonds had one of the worst years in history this downturn followed a period in which the investing environment was almost ideal these market ups and downs are a normal part of investing and there are some basic principles that can help investors in every type of market first take a longterm approach when investing if you can afford to leave your money invested through the inevitable ups and downs of financial markets you will greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline over time for example stock prices have gone up  and have significantly outperformed other types of investments and stayed ahead of inflation second you can further manage risk by diversifying your investments a stock mutual fund is already diversified because it invests in many different companies you can increase your diversification by investing in a number of different stock funds or in different investment categories such as bonds you should also keep money youll need in the near future in a more stable investment finally it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan investing a set amount of money at the same time each month or quarter that way you can avoid getting caught up in the excitement of a rapidlyrising market  and wont end up buying all your shares at market highs this strategy wont assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market but it should help you lower the average cost of your purchases for this to be effective you must continue to buy shares in both up and down markets if you have questions please call us at  we would be happy to send you a fidelity fundmatch kit which can help you determine the mix of investments that is right for you you might also find it convenient to set up a regular investment plan using the fidelity automatic account buildersm we look forward to hearing from you best regards edward c johnson d performance the bottom line to measure a money market funds performance you can look at either total return or yield total return reflects the change in a funds share price over a given period and reinvestment of its dividends or income yield measures the income paid by a fund since a money market fund tries to maintain a  share price yield is an important measure of performance cumulative total returns periods ended april   past  past  past  past  months year years years fidelity municipal money market fund     all taxfree money market funds average     cumulative total returns show the funds performance in percentage terms over a set period  in this case six months one year five years or  years for example if you invested  in a fund that had a  return over the past year the value of your investment would be  to measure how the funds performance stacked up against its peers you can compare it to the all taxfree money market funds average which reflects the performance of  taxfree money market funds with similar objectives tracked by ibc financial data inc ibc over the past six months the periods covered by ibc numbers are the closest match to those covered by the fund average annual total returns periods ended april   past  past  past  year years years fidelity municipal money market fund    all taxfree money market funds average    average annual total returns take the funds actual or cumulative return and show you what would have happened if the fund had achieved that return by performing at a constant rate each year yields      fidelity municipal      money market fund all taxfree money market      funds average fidelity municipal      money market fund taxequivalent row

refers to the income paid by the fund over a given period yields for money market funds are usually for sevenday periods expressed as annual percentage rates a yield that assumes income earned is reinvested or compounded is called an effective yield the chart above shows the funds current sevenday yield at quarterly intervals over the past year you can compare these yields to the all taxfree money market funds average or you can look at the funds taxequivalent yield which assumes youre in the  tax bracket figures for the all taxfree money market funds average are from ibc a money market funds total returns and yields will vary and reflect past results rather than predict future performance comparing performance yields on taxfree investments are usually lower than yields on taxable investments however a straight comparison between the two may be misleading because it ignores the way taxes reduce taxable returns taxequivalent yield  the yield youd have to earn on a similar taxable investment to match the taxfree yield  makes the comparison more meaningful keep in mind that the us government neither insures nor guarantees a money market fund and there is no assurance that a money fund will maintain a  share price checkmark fund talk the managers overview an interview with deborah watson portfolio manager of fidelity municipal money market fund q deborah what kind of investment climate have you been operating in for the past six months a conditions have changed dramatically since the beginning of the period last october the economy was still growing slowly inflationary pressures were modest and there appeared to be bipartisan support in congress for a balancedbudget agreement all that helped persuade the federal reserve to continue pursuing a monetary policy designed to stimulate economic growth the fed lowered the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans  known as the federal funds rate  onequarter percentage point in december and another onequarter percentage point in january  to  since then however weve seen signs of increased economic activity in a number of key areas including employment and home sales at the same time hopes for a balanced budget agreement have faded and recently both the producer price index and the consumer price index have begun rising at a rate that suggests inflationary pressures may be building so far the fed has stayed on the sidelines however toward the end of the period market pressures had nudged shortterm rates higher anticipating a possible fed rate increase as early as the end of may q how did your strategy change in light of changing conditions a last fall when rates seemed likely to continue declining i positioned the fund fairly aggressively the funds average maturity was  days at the end of october by the end of december it was  days in early march as market sentiment shifted and the potential for higher rates in the near future increased i began selling some of the funds longerterm securities by the end of april the funds average maturity was toward the defensive side of neutral at  days q how did the fund perform a the funds sevenday yield on april   was  compared to  six months ago the latest yield was the equivalent of a  taxable yield for investors in the  federal tax bracket the fund had a total return for six months of  compared to  for the all taxfree money market funds average according to ibc financial data inc q why is the fund changing its name a as of may   the fund will be known as fidelity municipal money market fund even though the funds name is being changed the funds objective remains the same  to provide taxfree income the name change is a result of a change in the funds investment policy that will allow me to begin buying securities subject to the alternative minimum tax  often referred to as amt securities this change is a benefit to shareholders because it gives me greater flexibility in pursuing all marketplace opportunities  including areas dominated by amt securities amt securities are issued by municipalities to finance private activity such as airports multifamily housing and industrial development these securities typically offer higher yields than other municipal securities of comparable maturity without necessarily involving higher credit risk although the fund is now permitted to invest in any amount of municipal securities that may be considered taxable under the amt i dont expect to begin buying amt securities until early summer and when i do ill add them gradually six months from now its possible the fund may have about a  stake in amt securities q whats the outlook for interest rates and the economy a i think rates are likely to remain fairly stable over the next several months as market participants and the fed try to sort through conflicting signals on the strength of the economy im not convinced that the growth weve seen since the beginning of the year is sustainable yet theres enough uncertainty that another rate cut by the fed seems unlikely ill probably let the funds average maturity roll down into the mid s ahead of the annual summer borrowing season as abundant supplies enter the market i typically have opportunities to lengthen the funds average maturity at attractive rates the views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover the managers views are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions fund facts goal high current

municipal money market since  joined fidelity in  checkmark the alternative minimum tax and what it means for fixedincome investors the federal alternative minimum tax amt is an additional tax that may apply to those individuals in higher income tax brackets with large deductions andor exclusions from income investors may be subject to the amt if they benefit substantially from what are considered items of tax preference and adjustments such as mutual fund dividends attributable to certain municipal private activity bonds most of fidelitys municipal money market funds do have the ability to invest in securities that are subject to the amt the ability to invest in such securities allows our portfolio managers more latitude in selecting securities for their portfolios and helps foster greater portfolio diversification of course if you are not subject to the amt the taxexempt status of the income you receive from a fidelity municipal bond or money market fund will not be affected if you are an investor who is subject to the amt or if you are unsure you should consult your tax advisor for further information investment changes maturity diversification days  of fund

fund proposal  proposal description applicable funds page  to continue the effectiveness of article vii section  of the trust instrument all   to authorize the trustees to adopt an amended and restated trust instrument all   to elect as trustees the thirteen nominees presented in proposal  all   to amend the funds fundamental investment limitation concerning underwriting fidelity tax managed stock fund   to amend the funds fundamental investment limitation concerning lending fidelity tax managed stock fund   to continue the effectiveness of article vii section  of the trust instrument the board of trustees recommends that shareholders vote to continue the effectiveness of article vii section  of the trust instrument on september   pursuant to authority granted to the trustees under article xi section  of the trust instrument and applicable laws the trustees modified a provision in the trust instrument to resolve any legal uncertainty regarding derivative actions brought on behalf of a fund under state law in order for a shareholder to file most derivative actions on behalf of a fund the shareholder must first make demand on the trustees of the fund to bring the claim however claims for violation of fiduciary duty involving the receipt of compensation by an adviser can be brought directly by the shareholder without first making demand on the trustees notwithstanding their authority to amend the trust instrument the trustees authorized the submission of this amendment to shareholders to vote on the continued effectiveness of the provision the amended provision currently in effect is set forth below section  in addition to the requirements set forth in section  of the delaware act a shareholder may bring derivative action on behalf of the trust only if the shareholder or shareholders first make a presuit demand upon the trustees to bring the subject action unless an effort to cause the trustees to bring such action is excused a demand on the trustees shall only be excused if a majority of the board of trustees or a majority of any committee established to consider the merits of such action has a personal financial interest in the action at issue a trustee shall not be deemed to have a personal financial interest in an action or otherwise be disqualified from ruling on a shareholder demand by virtue of the fact that such trustee receives remuneration from his service on the board of trustees of the trust or on the boards of one or more investment companies with the same or an affiliated investment advisor or underwriter the amendment provides that a trustee shall not be deemed to have a personal interest or otherwise be disqualified from considering a presuit demand by a shareholder to bring a derivative action on behalf of a fund due to his or her service on boards of trustees of other funds with the same or affiliated investment advisor or underwriter there is some legal uncertainty regarding whether a trustee serving on multiple boards of trustees is independent of the investment advisor and therefore permitted to consider a presuit demand by a shareholder seeking to assert a claim against a funds investment advisor the trustees seek to ensure that they retain the ability to manage the affairs of the funds including control of derivative actions that are brought on behalf of a fund this provision in the amendment will resolve any legal uncertainty by expressly stating that a trustee shall not be deemed to have a personal interest or otherwise be disqualified from considering a presuit demand due to his or her service on multiple fund boards of trustees continuing the effectiveness of the amendment will not alter in any way the trustees existing fiduciary obligations to act with due care and in shareholders interests if shareholders do not vote to continue the provisions effectiveness the trustees will execute an amended and restated trust instrument which replaces the version of article vii section  discussed above with the following version which appeared prior to the september   amendment by the trustees section  except as otherwise provided in section  of the delaware act all matters relating to the bringing of derivative actions in the right of the trust shall be governed by the general corporation law of the state of delaware relating to derivative actions and judicial interpretations thereunder as if the trust were a delaware corporation and the shareholders were shareholders of a delaware corporation conclusion the board of trustees has concluded that continuing the effectiveness of the amendment to article vii section  of the trust instrument is in the best interests of the trusts shareholders accordingly the trustees unanimously recommend that shareholders vote for the proposal if the proposal is approved article vii section  will remain unchanged as it appears in the current trust instrument if the proposal is not approved the trustees will execute an amended and restated trust instrument incorporating the version of article vii section  that was in effect prior to the september   amendment by the trustees  to authorize the trustees to adopt an amended and restated trust instrument the board of trustees has approved and recommends that the shareholders of the trust authorize them to adopt and execute an amended and restated trust instrument in the form attached to this proxy statement as exhibit  new trust instrument the new trust instrument has been marked to show changes from the trusts existing trust instrument current trust instrument the new trust instrument is based on a standard form that will be used for all new fidelity funds organized as delaware business trusts going forward the new trust instrument gives the trustees more flexibility and subject to applicable requirements of the  act and delaware law broader authority to act this increased flexibility may allow the trustees to react more quickly to changes in competitive and regulatory conditions and as a consequence may allow the funds to operate in a more efficient and economical manner adoption of the new trust instrument will not alter in any way the trustees existing fiduciary obligations to act with due care and in the shareholders interests before utilizing any new flexibility that the new trust instrument may afford the trustees must first consider the shareholders interests and then act in accordance with such interests under the current trust instrument shareholders generally have the right to vote on any amendment affecting their right to vote any amendment affecting the amendment provisions of the trust instrument any amendment required by law or the trusts registration statement and any matter submitted to the shareholders by the trustees on november   the trustees approved the form of the new trust instrument on june   the board authorized the submission of the new trust instrument to the trusts shareholders for their authorization at this meeting number of trustees the new trust instrument modifies the current trust instrument to allow the trustees to increase the maximum number of trustees from twelve  to fourteen  this increase is intended to enhance the flexibility of the board to organize itself and its committees in overseeing management of the fidelity funds and to expand the level of the boards expertise termination of the trust or its series or classes unlike the current trust instrument the new trust instrument generally permits the trustees subject to applicable federal and state law to terminate all or a portion of the trust or any of its series or classes the current trust instrument requires shareholder approval in order to terminate the trust or any of its series under certain circumstances it may not be in the shareholders interest to require a shareholder meeting to permit the trustees to terminate a fund or class for example a fund may have insufficient assets to invest effectively or excessively high expense levels due to operational needs under such circumstances absent viable alternatives the trustees may determine that terminating the fund is in the shareholders interest and the only appropriate course of action the process of obtaining shareholder approval of the funds termination may however make it more difficult to complete the funds liquidation and termination and in general will increase the costs associated with the termination in such a case it may be in the shareholders interest to permit fund termination without incurring the costs and delays of a shareholder meeting as discussed above before allowing a trust fund or class termination to proceed without shareholder approval the trustees have a fiduciary responsibility to first determine that the proposed transaction is in the shareholders interest any exercise of the trustees increased authority under the new trust instrument is also subject to any applicable requirements of the  act and delaware law of course the new trust instrument would require that shareholders receive written notification of any proposed termination conclusion the board of trustees has concluded that the proposed adoption of the new trust instrument is in the best interests of the trusts shareholders accordingly the trustees unanimously recommend that the shareholders vote for the proposal to authorize them to adopt and execute the new trust instrument if the proposal is not approved the current trust instrument will remain unchanged and in effect as explained in proposal  please note that notwithstanding approval of proposal  if proposal  is not approved the trustees will execute an amended and restated trust instrument incorporating the version of article vii section  that was in effect prior to the september   amendment of article vii section  by the trustees  to elect a board of trustees the purpose of this proposal is to elect a board of trustees of the trust the trustees have determined that the board of trustees should be expanded from a maximum of twelve to a maximum of fourteen members and have fixed the number of trustees at thirteen pursuant to the provisions of the trust instrument of fidelity beacon street trust the increase in the size of the board of trustees is subject to shareholder approval see
