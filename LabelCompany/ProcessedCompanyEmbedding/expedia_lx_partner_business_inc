endpoints it verifies each endpoint to ensure that proper responses are generated for requests that are expected to succeed and it also verifies that the correct api errors are returned in scenarios where an error should be generated what is included in the avtzip file the download link for the avt can be found on the api portal this link will download a zip file that contains the following items apiverificationtooljar this is a precompiled java executable that runs all of the tests that will help ensure your api endpoints are performing according to the behaviors defined in the api spec avtlog this is a sample output log file that gives an example of what the avt output will look like after running against your endpoints this file will contain a list of all of the tests that were run and any errors that were encountered it will also include information for troubleshooting what may be causing any of the tests to fail please attach this log with any emails that you may send about troubleshooting test failures refapiconf this is a sample config file that is used by the apiverificationtooljar to run the tests you will need to modify this configuration file to provide the correct values for connecting to your endpoint as well as the partner ids for things like supplier branch ids activity ids offer ids and ticket type ids that will be used by the tests to generate the correct responses please attach this file when you have completed your testing and are ready for us to perform final verification readmemd this file contains information about how to configure and execute the avt and should be able to answer the most common questions about what you need to know in order to get the avt working running the avt there are  phases to running the avt phase  in the first phase you can run the avt locally on your own dev machine or from within your own test environment to ensure that things are being developed correctly this will allow very rapid turnaround time from running the test and evaluating results to fixing bugs during this time if you have any questions about how to interpret test failures or how to setup the avt to run correctly please email us the refapiconf and avtlog files from your most recent test run and we can assist you phase  once the avt is passing in your local environment email us your refapiconf file and we will run the avt from our production network the primary purpose of this secondary test is to ensure that our network is able to connect to yours and that we are not encountering any errors in transit during communication with your api endpoints whats required to run the avt the avt requires a java runtime environment and access to the environment that is hosting your api the avt can be run from any computer that meets these requirements and does not need to be run locally from within the environment how do i run the avt in order to run the avt you will need to modify the config file that it came with you will need to provide the proper values in this config file so that the avt can connect to your api and different tests will need to have specific platform ids entered for example in some cases you may need to specify a partnerofferid that has been sold out or a partnersupplierbranchid that will not be recognized by your api once you have completed entering the correct values into the config file you may run the tool from the terminal with the following command usage java jar apiverificationtooljar configurationfile outputfile testsuite testcase options configurationfile the file that contain the configuration information you just entered default avtconf outputfile the avt will write the test output to this file default avtlog testsuite allows limiting the tests to only those within the

that dont require a distinction between an activity that was available on that date but is now sold out and one that was never available on that date checkofferdateavailability acceptversion this test checks for backwards compatibility of the platforms api and may not be necessary for new platforms that never implemented an older version of the api createsale thisconfigurationnotavailable this test checks for a response that indicates an error that doesn’t fall into other categories a common example of this is when a booking doesnt meet the minimum ticket count requirements and it may not be necessary for platforms where all such error cases are covered by more descriptive error types commitsale salenotfound this test checks for a proper error response when the commit of a nonexistent sale is requested it may not be necessary if the platform is not implementing twophase commit for sales in that case the sale should already have been committed on the create sale call commitsale saleexpired this test checks for a response that indicates the hold time on a create sale request has expired and thus the sale cannot be committed without being recreated it may not be necessary if the platform does not enforce the sale expiration window createsalecancellation salenotfound this test checks for a proper error response when the creation of a sale cancellation for a nonexistent sale is requested it may not be necessary if the platform is not implementing twophase commit for cancellations in that case the cancellation will be created during the commit sale cancellation request and the error will be thrown at that time createsalecancellation salenotcancellable this test checks for a proper error response when the creation of a sale cancellation is requested for an activity that is past the cancellation cutoff time it may not be necessary if the platform is not implementing twophase commit for cancellations in that case the cancellation will be created during

createsalecancellation salenotcommitted this test checks for a proper error response when the creation of a sale cancellation is requested for a sale that was never committed it may not be necessary if the platform is not implementing twophase commit for sales in that case the sale will always be either committed or cancelled and an uncommitted sale will never exist if however the platform is

unabletoprocessrequest with an error description explaining the reason general api integration faq api keys why is the api key in xrequestauthentication different than the one generated in my api when validating the incoming api authentication header you may receive an incorrect validation failure if the base  encoding is performed on the hex encoded has instead of the raw hash for example you may generate an internal authentication hash similar to this oezfmzkmzzdmuinmnkywrjgynuiwmdfgntenejcoeintgmtdcrkuyqzbgrddcnummjrfnthbmeyna while the incoming authentication hash looks similar to this jounsgfebwcwwafuysiwgfiwpxjjowkdq if this is the case check to make sure you are base  encoding the raw hash of the api key and request identifier and that you are not base  encoding the hex encoded hash of the api key and request identifier please refer to the additional api documentation linked from the swagger page here for more details mapping as an expedia supplier how do i map my activities expedia takes on all of the work required to map your activities correctly please direct supplier inquiries to your api integration contact the timeline for onboarding suppliers and mapping them to be agreed between expedia and the platform what happens if not all products are mapped before go live you must map all of your activities offers and ticket ids currently available and live on expedia we cannot switch a supplier to connectivity unless all live activities offers or ticket types have been mapped beforehand doing so would cause booking failures for unmapped products allow bookings to be made without going into your reservation system general availability check gac the gac tool is used for the advanced availability check this tool makes use of the same availability check endpoint that you have developed for the realtime availability check during the customer booking flow however it provides a wider date range so that we can precache the inventory counts available for your products for the next  days the gac will query the activities and offers that we are planning to launch with in order to get a baseline of the inventory counts available once your platform is live in production this tool will run each night in order to get an updated count of inventory for products so that dates that have been sold out or taken off sale can be updated correctly in our system booking api how do i implement booking apis when my platform does not support phase commit if your platform does not support twophase booking eg booking hold then you must commit the booking when the create sale api is called so that any errors during booking can be reported back in the response there are  additional scenarios in which the sale must be cancelled so that the suppliers inventory is not tied up with an incomplete booking and so that suppliers maintain an accurate view of what they should be expecting in booking payments from expedia if you dont receive a commit sale api call before the time specified by the utcholdexpiration parameter has elapsed if you receive a release sale api call at any time cancellation api how do i implement cancellation apis when my platform does not support phase commit if your platform does not support twophase cancellation eg cancellation hold then you must commit the cancellation when the commit sale cancellation api is called in this case both the create sale cancellation and release sale cancellation apis can be noop calls from your end that return static api responses with the exception that if the release sale cancellation api is called after the commit sale cancellation api has been called then the proper response is to generate an error indicating that the cancellation request has already been committed explore more about
