confectionery manufacturing rocky mountain chocolate factory inc rmcf is a leading chain of confectionery stores the company has about  retail locations in the united states concentrated primarily on the west coast and in the sun belt canada guam and the united arab emirates and a squarefoot factory near durango colorado the retail stores are typically located in tourist areas or factory outlet malls all but a handful are franchised unable to find a suitable shipper the company has built its own fleet of brown and bronze refrigerated semis the factory produces  types of candies and retail stores also produce a number of handdipped items using traditional methods the bestselling items are caramel apples followed by bears turtles one key to the companys success is the experience of many of the confections being whipped up at the stores marketing executive ed dudley described it this way in the rocky mountain news because all of your senses are engaged its about giving the customer a five to minute vacation creating a sweet job in colorado the rocky mountain chocolate factory rmcf was built around a location and a lifestyle franklin e crail had owned a thriving company in newport beach california that produced billing software for the cable tv industry cni data processing inc but he and his wife wanted to raise a family in a small town they settled in durango colorado where crail prospected for an entrepreneurial niche it came down to either a car wash or a chocolate shop he says in the companys official history frank crail later told candy industry he would have been content to open a sees candy store but the california company did not franchise instead he enlisted two partners and opened the first rmcf shop on durangos main street on memorial day  the town was something of a tourist attraction known for its scenic railroad and outdoor recreation many future stores also would be opened in vacation spots in order to be close to a large volume of traffic the stores themselves became tourist attractions in their own right with much of the confectionmaking process on display trademarks included handdipped caramel apples and fresh fudge heated in copper kettles and cooled on a pound marble slab the selection was staggering with some stores offering  kinds of apples ranging from basic caramel to a gourmet white chocolate and oreo masterpiece wholesale chocolate was sourced from burlingame californias guittard chocolate company and other suppliers true to its rugged mountain origins rmcf became known for its big chunky portions one of its peanut butter cups was large enough to be called the bucket the chocolate also won awards for taste the venture was successful from the start although tourist traffic was strong in the summer locals shopped for gifts for christmas and valentines day crails partners opened other stores in breckenridge and boulder colorado within a year the first franchised stores were opened in  in colorado springs and park city utah crail later told coloradobiz that the typical franchisee was a professional who wanted to set out upon a second career in a small familyoriented town much as crail himself had done an offsite chocolate factory also was opened in  and rocky mountain chocolate factory inc was incorporated in november of that year crails two partners left the business in  public in  crail took the

some of its factory operations after years of making almost everything by hand kansas city missouri chocolate giant whitmans candies inc a unit of russell stover candies inc made an offer to buy rmcf for around  million in  but was rebuffed by management after rmcfs operating results improved later in the year with  employees in durango rocky mountain chocolate factory was the towns largest

to  in sales per year company perspectives frank crail had a dream to raise a family in a quiet small town environment not having a plan to support his dream in durango colorado the quaint victorianera town in which they had chosen to settle he began surveying the towns local residents and merchants it came down to either a car wash or a chocolate shop recalls the father of seven i

chief operating officer we are going to start the call this afternoon with bryan giving you a summary of both the fourth quarter and fiscal  year end operating results and at the conclusion of his presentation we will be happy to answer any questions that you may have so at this time i’d like to turn the call over to bryan bryan merryman thanks frank i would also like to welcome everyone to today’s call and i will start with the fiscal year total revenues decreased  this year versus last year factory revenues decreased  due primarily to a  decrease in shipments to customers outside of our network of franchised stores and to a lesser extent a  decrease in samestore pounds purchased by our franchisees and licensees and a decline of  in the average number of domestic rocky mountain chocolate factory franchised stores in operation retail sales were down  this was due to the sale of a certain companyowned location and the closure of an underperforming companyowned location samestore sales at all companyowned stores and cafés increased  royalty and marketing fees were down  this was a  decrease in franchised units samestore sales at rocky mountain chocolate factory franchised stores increased  while samestore sales at domestic uswirl franchised cafés declined  total samestore domestic franchise sales across all brands decreased  franchise fees decreased  we had international license fees in the prior year of  with only  in the current year factory margins decreased  basis points this was due to maintenance equipment issues increased cost of labor and overhead and it was slightly offset by a decrease in certain commodities excluding retail expenses operating expenses decreased  on lower ga expense and lower franchise costs adjusted ebitda was  versus  last year net income for the year was  compared to  last year diluted earnings per share for the year was  compared to  in the prior year during the year we opened  stores  cold stone rocky mountain chocolate factory cobranded stores  domestic rocky mountain chocolate factory standalone stores  international locations and  domestic uswirl locations and  international uswirl location we finished the quarter with  million in cash a current ratio of  during the year we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately  and on march   the company paid its th consecutive quarterly cash dividend to shareholders in the amount of  per share during the first quarter we acquired certain assets of two small confectionery companies ferncreek confections and elaine’s toffee company these acquisitions allowed us to acquire an allnatural glutenfree line of products and a highend toffee line and also expanding our customer relationships on the quarter total revenues decreased  factory revenues were down  primarily due to  decrease in samestore pounds purchased by our franchisees and licensees partially offset by a  increase in shipments to customers outside our network of franchised and licensed stores retail sales decreased  again this was the result of a closing of the underperforming company location and the sale of certain companyowned locations samestore sales at all companyowned stores and cafés decreased  in the fourth quarter royalty and marketing fees decreased  in the fourth quarter this was due to a  decrease in domestic franchised units samestore sales at rocky mountain chocolate factory franchised stores decreased  while samestore sales at domestic uswirl franchised cafés declined  total samestore domestic franchise sales across all brands were down  in the quarter franchise fees decreased  fewer domestic uswirl locations opened this year versus last year factory margins were down  basis points again on increased labor and overhead costs related to maintenance and equipment issues and a product mix shift partially offset by a decrease in the cost of certain commodities excluding retail operating expenses operating expenses decreased  in the quarter on lower ga and franchise costs adjusted ebitda was  versus  last year in the fourth quarter net income was  this year versus  last year in the fourth quarter last year a very large tax benefit was recorded and that’s why there is such a dramatic swing in net income diluted earnings per share was  in the quarter compared to  in the prior year during the quarter we opened  stores  cold stone creamery cobranded stores  international rocky mountain locations and  domestic rocky mountain locations we finished the quarter with  million in cash current ratio of  and again we paid our th consecutive quarterly cash dividend to shareholders in the amount of  per share and with that i will turn it back over to frank franklin crail thanks bryan okay operator at this time we’d be happy to answer any questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from bryan london a private investor please go ahead bryan london yes i asked a couple of conference calls ago and i just wanted to followup and see if you had any more color on selling candy bars or the tote bags to the grocery stores bryan merryman our sales – our wholesale sales to larger retail chains were down significantly this year over last year i think we actually performed pretty well but we weren’t able to keep a lot of the shelf space that was allocated to us and it was never a really large number in terms of revenues but that business is down and i can tell you in the future we will be really trying a more regional approach as opposed to a national approach with chains like target i think that we will more look to retail on more regional players to move our product and continue to grow with our existing partners outside of our stores bryan london okay yes i had – i live in california and i noticed the tote bag from target for a little while and i know this is a little anecdotal i noticed ghirardelli and lindt with similarsized tote bags were selling for  or  each and rocky mountain chocolate factory ones were selling for  each and i was also wondering if you guys have any kind of leverage or control over the price or maybe if you guys are having – are you faced with slotting fees with – when you go to the grocery stores just kind of curious about any kind of feedback in terms of that bryan merryman well we don’t i mean we certainly don’t have any pricing power i mean those kind of retailers dictate prices our cost structure and our product quality is such that we are not going to compete with lindt and ghirardelli and the other big players that have the lion’s share of shelf space i think there’s the opportunity to get rotated in and be in for a period of time and then you get replaced with another specialty chocolatier and so you can be in and out of these retailers but to get a permanent shelf space allocation as you would say requires slotting fees we don’t do that and we just don’t have the cost structure to compete on price bryan london correct okay thank you operator our next question comes from david luebke of summit brokerage please go ahead david luebke hi my question you had the machinery maintenance and equipment issues in the fourth quarter would that be a onetime event or not bryan merryman well actually it – we had issues in our factory around maintenance and equipment and in the first quarter we were way down with sales to a particular large customer and those problems really plagued us all year it was the worst in the fourth quarter we made the decision that we were going to get the product out and we were going to get it to our customers no matter what so we spent way more on labor and overhead than we typically do we have seen a nice improvement in march and april do not expect those fourth quarter trends to continue into next year and would expect pretty good margin improvement next year over this year we have worked i wouldn’t say through all of the issues but most of them and we will be investing heavily in maintenance and equipment this year as well and so i don’t foresee any of the kind of large issues that we have this year i think we will have another year of investment and the factory will i think be in tiptop shape by the end of this next fiscal year and we have already seen an improvement david luebke okay and as far as other expenses costs i see where dairy farmers can hardly give away milk and the price of cocoa was – has dropped a lot too is that affecting your cost structure yet or is that going to take a while bryan merryman well i mean it has helped unfortunately we have other costs that are growing and that has certainly helped us unfortunately cocoa butter hasn’t come down to the extent like the cocoa contract has and sugar and some nuts so we are definitely benefiting from lower commodity costs and we should see – again we shouldn’t have the recurring issues that we have this last fiscal year we will see margin improvements from that and we should also see some margin improvement from commodities as well it’s not going to be huge but i do expect that we will have incrementally better margins than we did in fiscal  david luebke okay thanks i have one more question but i can wait bryan merryman no you go ahead you don’t have to get back in queue david luebke well any outlook on the dividend increase decrease stay the same bryan merryman i think that if the company executes it can grow this fiscal year again i think we are off to a good start and put a couple of wellexecuted quarters behind it i think we would be in a position to consider a dividend increase but i think we are going to have to see execution in our business for a few more quarters before we do david luebke okay thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from vincent rudisill a private investor please go ahead vincent rudisill thank you my question is looking longer term the company has kind of been plodding along for a number of years now you just spoke about the dividend and most quarters you are covering the dividend as presumably that’s going to be maintained and possibly increased as you mentioned but other than paying dividends and occasionally repurchasing stock what’s the longterm vision for the company i guess stated another way if we were to look back  years from now what in particular should we as shareholders look to to measure whether or not the goals for the company were achieved thank you bryan merryman i think longer term we need to open more domestic rocky mountain chocolate factory franchised stores and we have been evaluating a number of ways to help that happen and i think that’s critical to our future over the last  years we have not been opening as much domestically as we would like we have had some international success some ups and down but had some success growing there and so i think we need to accelerate our domestic franchise openings for sure we need to continue to grow our sales outside of our system this year was definitely a setback and for the first time in a number of years specialty market sales as we term them are down this year over last year it’s the first time that that’s happened in the last  years we would expect going forward that we would see yearoveryear increases there we would like to see just like i said an acceleration in domestic franchise openings continued international growth but we definitely need to get the company’s top line going and we are doing everything we can to try to make that happen vincent rudisill okay thank you and i mean are there any metrics that you are using to have longterm goals that are possibly related to compensation bonuses and so forth do you use metrics of any sort other than just indicating you would like to open more franchised stores again i am kind of trying to understand where you want to take the company longer term bryan merryman well we don’t – i mean what we have disclosed is what we disclose we don’t disclose anything else than what we have disclosed in our filings and those are – you can find metrics on the company in our filings but of course we would like to grow our samestore sales that’s important to us we would like to see unit growth we don’t talk about it super specifically we don’t do – we don’t give guidance and so i am not sure i can give you the detail that you are looking for in terms of what we disclose and what we are willing to disclose but we would like to see the company expand internationally would like to see it expand domestically and we would like to continue to grow our sales profitably outside of our system we would like to see rockymountainchocolatefactorycom play a larger role in sales going forward our franchise system had rmcfcom really until this last year it was our first year with it we saw large increases in sales there we would like to continue to grow that and see it grow rapidly at least in terms of percentages and so that’s as specific as i can get for you and that’s my answer vincent rudisill okay thank you operator we show no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to mr crail for any closing remarks franklin crail right thank you operator thank you everyone for listening to our conference call this afternoon and we look forward to talking

fiscal  yearend conference call i’m frank crail president of rocky mountain chocolate factory and with me here today is mr bryan merryman the company’s chief operating officer we’re going to start the call today with bryan giving you a summary of both our fourth quarter and fiscal  yearend operating results and at the conclusion of this presentation we’ll be happy to answer any questions that you may have so at this time i’d like to turn the call over to bryan bryan merryman thank you frank i’d also like to welcome everyone to today’s call i’m going to start with details on operating results from the yearended  february  and then get into a little detail on the fourth quarter then i’ll turn the conference back over to frank for questionandanswers total revenues for the year declined  from  million last year to  million this year this was driven by factory sales increase of  primarily due to  increase in shipments to customers outside of our network of domestic franchised and licensed stores this increase was partially offset by lower domestic rocky mountain chocolate factory stores in operation and a  decline in same store pounds purchased royalty and marketing fees decreased  we had a decline in domestic rocky mountain chocolate factory units in operation of  and we also had a decline of  in total franchised units in operations the result of store closures and acquired yogurt franchise systems in line with expectations that poor performing stores would close we had fewer acquisitions and store openings this year to offset these declining units we also had a systemwide samestore sale increase of  rocky mountain chocolate factory stores’ samestore sales were up  and our yogurt stores declined on a samestore sales basins  franchise fees decreased  due to fewer international license fees retail sales declined  this was the result of the sale of three uswirl locations and the closure of two underperforming uswirl companyowned locations we also sold two rocky mountain chocolate factory companyowned locations we had a  decrease in companyowned stores’ samestore retail sales factory adjusted margins decreased  basis points this was the result of a change in customer and product mix resulting from the addition of new customers and products outside our system of franchised and licensed locations we also saw a higher commodity prices particularly in the first six months of the year with a little of abatement in the secondhalf of the year but still pressured our margins adjusted ebitda for the year was  million versus  million in the prior year income from operations decreased  in fiscal year  to approximately  million compared with  million a year earlier the decrease in operating income resulted from charges related to the impairment of goodwill and certain companyowned longlived assets of uswirl pretax income declined  to  million in fiscal  versus  million in the previous fiscal year the company recognized an income tax benefit of  in fiscal year  compared with an effective tax rate of  and an expense of  million in fiscal year  an income tax benefit of approximately  million was recognized during fourth quarter as the result of the company foreclosing upon its interest in uswirl and recognizing tax assets reserved for when uswirl was a separate tax entity rmcf will consolidate uswirl in future tax returns and consequently with tax assets that were fully reserved for previously now had their valuation allowances reversed net income was approximately  million compared to  million in the previous fiscal year the difference between the decrease in operating income and the increase in income attributable to rmcf shareholders was primarily due to a  million charge for impairment of goodwill and certain longlived company store assets more than offset by income tax benefit of  million of the impairment charge of  million  of that is absorbed by the noncontrolling interest in uswirl fully diluted earningspershare was  versus  in the prior year on march  the company paid its st consecutive quarterly cash dividend of  per share during the year we continued to repurchase shares buying approximately  shares or  of the shares outstanding we opened  new locations in fiscal  including  uswirl locations  cold stone creamery locations and  international locations as well as  domestic standalone rocky mount chocolate factory openings on february   the company foreclosed on its loan with uswirl inc the company’s  owned subsidiary due to defaults and nonpayment by swrl as a result of the foreclosure uswirl international inc which contains all of the franchise and other operating assets of uswirl became a whollyowned subsidiary of the company earlier today the company announced that its nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend will be paid on june   in the amount of  per share for the quarter total revenues decreased  from  million to  million factory revenues increased  this was driven by  increase in shipments to customers outside our system of franchised stores retail sales declined  this was the result of the sale of three uswirl locations and the closure of two underperforming uswirl companyowned locations we also sold a rocky mountain chocolate factory companyowned location in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter samestore sales at all companyowned locations increased to  rocky mountain chocolate factory stores increased  and uswirl stores increased  royalty and marketing fees decreased  in the fourth quarter this was driven by a decline of  in the total franchised units in operation the result of store closures and acquired franchise systems for the yogurt franchise fees decreased  in the fourth quarter primarily as the result of higher international license fees in the prioryear quarter with no such fees occurring in the current year quarter factory margins decreased  basis points in the fourth quarter to    versus  this resulted from a change in customer and product mix resulting from the addition of new customers and products outside our system of franchised and licensed locations it was partially offset by a slight decline in certain commodity costs in the fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was  in the fourth quarter versus  in the fourth quarter of last year net income was approximately  compared with  fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter was  versus  last year we opened  new locations in the fourth quarter including two uswirl locations four cobranded cold stone locations and five international openings we finished the quarter with  million in cash and current ratio of  to  and that’s  with that i’ll turn it back over to frank for any questions that you may have franklin crail okay thanks bryan operator at this time we’d be happy to answer any questions that anyone might have questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from tim call with capital management group please go ahead timothy call congratulations with growing your systemwide chocolate store base but sequentially in yearoveryear what’s the outlook for international chocolate store growth today and has the bank lending environment eased at all for cold stone creamery cobranding opportunities to grow franklin crail i believe that we’ll see continued international growth opportunities and see more international openings and we do have domestically i believe also that on a longerterm basis international would be a contributor to our profitability longterm we don’t expect it to move the needle in the shortterm but i still see faster growth international than we’ll see domestically and what was the second part of your question i’m sorry timothy call the lending environment for cold stone creamery stores to have moved to cobranded with rocky mountain franklin crail i’m not sure the lending environment really was an impediment to growth in terms of cold stone creamery stores remodeling their stores so that become a cobranded cold stone rocky mountain chocolate factory store i think that’s more applicable to standalone rocky mountain chocolate factory stores and i think well that lending environment is somewhat not much for the kind of franchise that we attract timothy call what are the expansion opportunities for things like candy bars serial and internet sales franklin crail well i think the candy bars serials we have less opportunities going right now then we do with the ability of expand our online sales to rocky mountain chocolate factory or rmcfcom i think there is a great opportunity for that i think that in our plans for the fiscal year that we are in right now is to grow that business significantly from a small base but still grow at significantly we won’t really know how successful we are with those efforts until q q that business will be a gifting business and we’ll be seasonal like most chocolate sales timothy call thank you operator the next question is a followup from tim call with capital management group please go ahead timothy call i just had a couple of more questions the interest expenses here fell around  because you’re paying off your promissory note as it comes due as that continues should we expect interest expense this coming up year to also fall around  or more bryan merryman i think it will be approximately in that range yes and we’ll continue to pay that down in interest expense will continue to go down timothy call and you expect to pay down debt as it comes due bryan merryman yes that’s our plan it’s not to pay that down that debt any earlier than it is due timothy call in the balance sheet cash is almost twice the level of current liabilities and your free cash flow remains very strong does that mean there is a chance later on this year that you might increase the annual dividend beyond  and are share buyback still a possibility bryan merryman well i’ll answer that question this way we have and we will continue to pay dividends buy back stock invest in the business within the constraints of the cash flow that’s generated by operations so specifically we don’t have plans to increase the dividend and that’s going to depend on whether we grow earnings and free cash flow and what the level of investment we’re going to make in our factory and so that is not a given but it is something that we continually look at timothy call thank you operator the next question comes from vincent rudisill ph a private investor please go ahead unidentified analyst thank you could you tell us what your longterm debt was on the balance sheet at the end of the fiscal year bryan merryman it was roughly  million total longterm debt and that is the current longterm purchase ph unidentified analyst and i believe you were owed  million from uswirl what is  what happens with that bryan merryman the note that was between uswirl inc and rocky mountain chocolate factory because we consolidated uswirl was eliminated in consolidation and that note has been satisfied through the foreclosure process and so that note is no longer in existence unidentified analyst okay all right thank you operator operator instructions the next question comes from bill wolfenden with cottonwood investments please go ahead bill wolfenden hi i have a couple of bigpicture questions the first one is if you could just talk broadly why the samestore sales were so strong in the fourth quarter and secondly what are the plans for uswirl because obviously that business wasn’t doing that well yet to foreclose on it so i’m just trying to figure out how that fits into your business franklin crail well i think uswirl continues to fit into our business it’s not too dissimilar from rocky mountain chocolate factory’s franchise system in terms of the infrastructure that you need to support those franchisees it’s a contributor in terms of cash flow and through the foreclosure process we got access to  million in cash and almost  million in tax assets and so i think it fits into what we’re doing and hopefully at some point we’ll see more units opening and closing as we get through the process of closing the weaker stores and we see a less saturated frozen yogurt market nationally so that’s the uswirl question and i think that the fourth quarter samestore sales there is no new trend there they were up slightly on the year they did better in the fourth quarter than they had on year but if you look at the year number on samestore sales it’s much weaker than last year but in line with the previous four years and so i don’t think there is any new trend in samestore sales we had four years of slightly positive samestores sales in one year our samestore sales were very strong bill wolfenden great and if i can just followup is the cash flow profile ie margins et cetera for uswirl similar to that of rocky mountain or is it lower franklin crail well on the rocky mountain side or on the uswirl side we don’t purchase the product that’s purchased by the franchise system so the revenue that’s generated per store is much lower in the yogurt business than it is in the chocolate business bill wolfenden okay thanks operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to frank crail for any closing remarks franklin crail thank you and i’d like to thank everyone that listen to our conference call this afternoon and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of the first quarter have a great day and thank you again bye
