consumption and political uncertainty more × uk despite the resilience of the uk economy since the eu referendum we are concerned about the implications of rising inflation on consumption and political uncertainty the uk economy remained resilient after the brexit referendum vote but data is now becoming less positive we are concerned that rising inflation will reduce consumers’ ability to spend in addition the government’s position has been weakened after losing their majority which can only add to uncertainty going into the brexit negotiations we expect this to continue to weigh on business investment while valuations remain reasonable and momentum is strong we remain cautious and are not adding to our uk exposure cash we are holding higher levels of cash than normal more × cash we are holding higher levels of cash than normal our analysis shows many developed world equities and bonds to be expensive versus history investor sentiment has improved substantially since the us election with commodity prices and inflation both rising but we believe this sentiment could reverse sharply which would have a negative impact on equities as a result we feel it is prudent to maintain a higher than average level of cash commodities we have limited exposure to energy equities more × commodities we have limited exposure to energy equities industrial metals and energy performed very well over the past year as the oil market recovered and china extended their fiscal stimulus but these forces appear to be reversing with the us producing more oil than a year ago and china tightening both monetary and fiscal policy oil is now down significantly from its january peak and there is little to suggest that this will reverse overall we do not feel positive about commodities we do not hold either gold or silver in our model portfolios as these assets can benefit from high uncertainty and political shocks we may include them in our bespoke clients’ portfolios on a case by case basis property our view on property is now neutral more × property our view on property is now neutral we are now neutral on property a slight improvement on our previously negative view although we have concerns about the trajectory of the uk economy the yield on property is attractive relative to other asset classes alternatives we are overweight alternatives mainly due to our negative views on other asset classes more × alternatives we are overweight alternatives mainly due to our negative views on other asset classes we see risks to many equity and bond markets and could even envisage a situation where both move down together given these concerns we’re maintaining a higher allocation to alternatives which typically exhibit a low correlation to conventional asset classes bonds we still hold a slightly negative view on government bonds and remain mildly positive on high yield bonds more × bonds we still hold a slightly negative view on government bonds and remain mildly positive on high yield bonds government bonds government bond yields increased sharply after donald trump’s election rising on expectations of fiscal stimulus deregulation and increasing us growth however markets are now taking a dimmer view after his first few months in power and we have a reversal with yields falling sharply and prices rising we have slightly increased our allocations but our overall view is still negative corporate bonds high yield bonds offer both greater yields than government bonds and a lower sensitivity to interest rates we see both high yield and investment grade as expensive versus history but remain slightly positive on both as in a world of low returns their yields are attractive we marginally prefer high yield due to the higher yield and lower sensitivity to interest rates and our allocations remain unchanged europe while political risks are present the improvement in growth reasonable valuations and light positioning are hard to ignore more × europe while political risks are present the improvement in growth reasonable valuations and light positioning are hard to ignore investors substantially reduced their allocations to european equities over the last few years as the european recovery lagged that of other developed markets this now appears to be reversing with improving economic growth and corporate earnings drawing money back in to the region emmanuel macron supported this narrative by winning the presidential and parliamentary elections in france a big proeu vote these elections had caused significant anxiety so this gave a real boost to investor sentiment towards europe however political risks may continue to present concerns we have german elections this summer and italian elections are likely in  assuming political stability remains european equities look to be well positioned for growth we have increased our european exposure – our most significant shift this quarter north america us equities have performed strongly in the wake of trump’s victory but investors are now looking for actions to justify the optimism more × north america us equities have performed strongly in the wake of trump’s victory but investors are now looking for actions to justify the optimism us equities performed strongly in the wake of trump’s victory in anticipation of progrowth policies and deregulation however these policy promises have not yet materialised and investors are growing frustrated at a lack of action as such we’ve seen many of the ‘trump trades’ fall away over recent months if trump fails to deliver and sentiment continues to fall we could see a variety of us equity sectors underperform so in spite of strong us growth we have a neutral view on us equities and have slightly reduced our allocations japan we have a positive view on japanese equities more × japan we have a positive view on japanese equities we maintain a positive view on japan due to strong momentum momentum refers to the current market trend – an important indicator of future performance there are signs of economic recovery in the form of wage increases and higher credit demand this alongside attractive valuations drives our moderately positive view on japanese equities emerging markets we are cautious about the commodity reliance of particular latin american economies so are reducing our exposure towards

asia pacific reasonable global growth and steady us rate hikes create a good climate for asian equities asian equities have performed well since trump’s election buoyed by improved global growth steady us rate hikes and stability in china this is a marked improvement from a few months earlier when investors were concerned asian economies would buckle under the weight of us rate hikes and protectionism we view this period as confirmation that asian equities can perform well in the current market and are maintaining our exposure × book a callback let us call you back at a convenient
