britain talks about the special relationship and his role in keeping it alivebarzun and his wife brooke have been a hit in the british capital bringing a new level of informality and fun to the ambassadors residence winfield house in regents park  connecttweet  linkedincommentemailmorewashington – on a train from london to hull matthew barzun decided to check the web to see what famous people were from the yorkshire city he was about the visitthe former louisville internet entrepreneur knows his way around mathematics and theory so he was excited to discover that john venn was from hullvenn devised a diagram of intersecting circles now known as logically the venn diagram the philosopher and logicians contribution is used in computer science among other fieldsbarzun  now the youthful and energetic united states ambassador to the united kingdom was so excited recounting his story last week during an interview with the courierjournal in a conference room at the state department that he got up and drew a venn diagram on the white boardmy first thought was i probably owe that guy royalties because in my internet days id drawn so many venn diagrams barzun joked retelling the storybut there was a broader point to this storyhe labeled one circle us and the other uk and the intersecting space in the middle is the special relationship the two nations have enjoyed for more than a century from joining together to help win world war ii to the alliance engaged in current negotiations with iran over its nuclear programindeed barzun said the mere act of looking up john venn got him thinking more about the common bonds between great britain and the united statesim on a train right the ambassador began steam locomotion  invented by brits it was actually an american who said we should use this for public transit and had a whole plan but couldnt get it done in america because it wasnt developed enough then it did of course happen in the uk and then it happened in america im using an iphone an american product designed by a brit from newcastle i log onto the internet invented by americans quickly adopted by the uk log on to the worldwide web invented by a brit commercialized in america to use wikipedia to find john venn founded by an american from alabama who now lives two blocks away from me in london so i just thought you know theres a happy venn diagrambarzun was making one of his infrequent visits home to kentucky and to washington and it is clear he has embraced his role as the nations most prominent ambassadorhe has been in his post since  a key fundraiser for president barack obama barzun previously served as the us ambassador to swedenbarzun and his wife brooke have been a hit in the british capital bringing a new level of informality and fun to the ambassadors residence winfield house in regents park the barzuns hosted a record  visitors in the residence last year those who were at parties might have been treated to a hot new indie band the ambassador likes or songs with annie lennox at the keyboards jeans are allowedthe financial times credited the american envoy with bringing a bracing informality to the practice of london diplomacythe london evening standard ran a glowing piece on the barzuns in february much of the story focused on brooke barzun under a headline that called her the hostess with the mostestthe ambassador and his wife could make scott and zelda fitzgerald look like party poopers the newspaper enthused now they are using their party power to push social changethe barzuns recently hosted a session in the residence on womens rights in the workplacethe ambassador also has become known in london as a fervent collector of vinyl records which he puts on the turntable at gatherings so that earned him praise for vinyl diplomacybarzun said he simply has tried to put into practice in london what he absorbed after moving to louisville in  its that wonderful blend of southern hospitality meets midwestern openness…we try to do that in all of our interactions in the ukwhen he was first headed to the court of st jamess some people advised him to park the term special relationship saying it was hackneyedso i thought about that for a moment and i think they are totally wrong i think it really is special barzun said noting that next year will mark the th anniversary of winston churchills coining of the special relationship phrase in his famous iron curtain speech in fulton mo and it remains today vibrant vitalamericans may not realize that  million people on this side of the atlantic work for british companies likewise  million british workers are employed by american companiesbut the relationship goes beyond business and trade and cultural similaritieswe mean the same things when we say as president obama did when he visited in  that we want to make the world more peaceful more prosperous more just we mean the same things by those important values barzun said we are willing to stand up speak up fight for those values together shouldertoshoulder around the worldthe ambassador told me he hopes to stay in london through the end of the obama presidencyi love this job i love every single day best job ive ever had barzun said his youthful face beaming and i do serve at the pleasure of the president so as long as he wants me here i will gladly continue to serve in this capacity until his term is over  and then i go back to kentuckyto run for officehe laughed and repeated his last sentence i go back to kentuckyno i really havent figured out what… he said trailing off theres so much taking up every day every week i just dont…theres more than enough to think about and work on and engage with the brits on every daybut when hes done in london he said
