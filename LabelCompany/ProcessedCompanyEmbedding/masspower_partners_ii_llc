judgmentplaintiff masspower and defendant massachusetts municipal wholesale electric company mmwec entered into a long term power purchase agreement ppa in  pursuant to which mmwec purchased electric power generated by masspowers springfield massachusetts facility   by  deregulation of the new england power supply market and changes in the operation of that market had made the ppa economically disadvantageous in mmwecs view and the parties attempted to negotiate a buyout of the ppathis lawsuit arises out of the failure of that negotiation mmwecs demand that masspower seek to operate the facility under the “mustrun” provision of the ppa masspowers refusal and mmwecs subsequent termination of the ppa masspower sues for breach of contract breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing violation of gl c a and abuse of process arising out of an earlier action which mmwec brought against masspowerthe case was tried without jury over eighteen days in february and march  followed by closing arguments on july  prior proceedingsthe prior proceedings in this case are particularly important to the determination of the matters now before the court because they bear on what issues were and were not to be tried   in  the appeals court affirmed judgment for masspower in the earlier case brought by mmwec and reversed a grant of summary judgment for mmwec in this case   in  this court ruled on subsequent dispositive motions   before addressing the parties contentions regarding the import of those rulings for this case it is necessary to set out in some detail what the appeals court and the motion judge decidedin  mmwec sued masspower and others alleging that masspower had breached the ppa breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and violated gl c a see mmwec v northern star generation llc et al  sucv  bls mmwec action or  action   following a jurywaived trial the court van gestel j entered findings and rulings and ordered judgment for defendantsin  masspower sued mmwec in the present case   the court gants j subsequently allowed summary judgment for mmwecappeals were taken in both cases and were consolidated before the appeals court which issued a rescript “memorandum and order pursuant to rule ” on november   appeals court decision   the appeals court decision affirmed the trial courts judgment against mmwec in the mmwec action vacated summary judgment for mmwec in this case and remanded this case “for further proceedings consistent with the memorandum and order of the appeals court”   id at the appeals court notes at the outset that “both cases involve the interpretation of the ppa ․ pursuant to which mmwec contracted to purchase  percent of the output from masspowers energy generating facility for a term of twenty years”  id at  the court continuesfor these appeals we rely on the facts as found by the superior court trial judge in his february   “findings of fact rulings of law and order for judgment” and on the undisputed facts set out in a second judges january   “memorandum of decision and order on crossmotions for summary judgment” supplemented where necessary by uncontroverted facts in the trial record and summary judgment materialsid at  emphasis suppliedaccordingly this court summarizes below the appeals courts recitation of the pertinent facts found in the mmwec case and of the undisputed facts set out in the motion judges memorandum on summary judgment in this case as the starting point for its own findings mmwec filed its complaint against masspower on june   “in response to a reduction in the frequency with which masspowers facility was being selected for dispatch” ie selected to provide power to the new england pool see discussion below  id at  the ppa was a contract between “sophisticated and wellrepresented parties the integration clause in the agreements final section prohibited alteration or expansion of matters specifically addressed therein”  id because the facility was “consistently maintained so as to be available for dispatch at all times” masspower “did not breach the ppa when the frequency with which the facility was selected for dispatch fell off dramatically after ”  id the appeals court defined and distinguished “economic dispatch” which was at the heart of the mmwec action from “mustrun” at the heart of the present action as followsthe judge properly interpreted “economic dispatch” under section  of the ppa to mean that masspower was obligated to maintain the facility to be available for dispatch in accordance with the nepool  rules for economic dispatch   pursuant to nepool rules facilities were selected for economic dispatch by a central system operator according to the price at which they could generate energy so that facilities offering cheaper prices for energy on a given day would be selected for dispatch before more expensive units   under the terms of the ppa masspowers facility was one that would be selected to operate based on its costs   in this manner the contract distinguished the mode of the facilitys operation from that of a mustrun facility a type of facility that operated at all times regardless of costsid at  addressing one of the central issues in the mmwec action appeal the court concluded  “we are in full accord with the judges conclusion that masspowers failure to price its energy so that it would be selected for dispatch on a nearly continuous basis did not constitute a breach of contract under the “economic dispatch” provisions of the ppa” id at as for the present case the court summarized the issues decided by judge gants on summary judgment as followson may   mmwec demanded that masspower seek to have the facility declared a mustrun operation pursuant to section  of the ppa masspower refused and mmwec terminated the ppa․  the mustrun provision in section  of the ppa states  “in the event that the facility is dispatched at a capacity factor of less than sixty percent over a two year period seller agrees to cooperate with buyer and the other purchasers if they decide to seek to have the facility declared ‘mustrun’ by nepool”   termination under the ppa is governed by section  which gives mmwec the right to terminate the ppa if masspower “shall fail in any material respect to comply with observe perform or shall default in any material respects upon any obligation under the agreement ․ and such failure materially and adversely effects  ” mmwec   the judge ruled first  that because there were no other purchasers as that term was used in the ppa as of  mmwec had the unilateral right to seek masspowers cooperation in having the facility declared mustrun   the judge also ruled second  that masspowers failure to do so constituted a material breach of a material obligation and third  that such breach satisfied the “materially and adversely effects” prong of the ppas termination provision without further proof of harmid at the court agreed with the motion judges first ruling  “we are satisfied on this record that by  there were no ‘other purchasers under the terms of the ppa” id at  and therefore no impediment to mmwecs “seeking to have the masspower facility declared mustrun”  id at    thus as masspower concedes it is the law of this case that mmwec was the sole “purchaser” under the ppa when it demanded that masspower seek to mustrun its plant   see plaintiffs posttrial proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law masspowers posttrial submission at the appeals court also agreed with the motion judges second ruling ie that “masspowers failure to cooperate in having the facility declared mustrun constituted a material breach of a material obligation ․” appeals court decision at  see discussion belowthe appeals court rejected the motion judges third ruling that such breach “satisfied the ‘materially and adversely effects prong of the ppas termination provision without further proof of harm”  id the court concluded that “whether mmwec was materially and adversely effected in the context of this industry and these parties is a question of fact that requires remand to the superior court for trial”  id at mmwec argues that the appeals court thus resolved the issue of whether by refusing to cooperate in mmwecs mustrun demand masspower materially breached the ppa see mmwecs pretrial legal mem at  masspower argues that whether it materially breached the ppa remains a live issue   masspower contends that mmwecs assertion “that the appeals court held that masspowers breach was ‘material’ not only is ․ inconsistent with the appeals courts general vacatur of judge gants decision but the court also specifically held that ‘whether mmwec was materially and adversely effected in the context of this industry and these parties is a question of fact that requires remand to the superior court for trial   appeals court decision at ’ ”   masspowers posttrial submission at  emphasis in originalmasspowers argument misreads both §  of the ppa and the appeals courts interpretation thereof and in particular the references in both to the term “material”   section  uses “material” in two separate contexts  first to modify “failure” and “default”   and second to modify the effect of any such failure or default on mmwec  masspower conflates those two different uses of “material” when it argues that the existence of fact issues as to whether the breach “materially ․ affected” mmwec as the appeals court determined means also that a fact issue exists as to whether the failure or default was material   the latter determinationie whether masspower failed or defaulted on an obligation in a manner that was significant rather than trivialcan be determined without reference to the effect of that failure or default on mmwec   indeed the appeals court points out that the two clauses of §  must both be given meaning  “ ‘an interpretation that gives a reasonable meaning to all of the provisions of a contract is to be preferred to one which leaves a part useless or inexplicable’ ”   appeals court decision at  citations omittedthe appeals court accordingly adopts the motion judges determination that no issue of fact exists as to whether masspowers breach was material and rejects his determination that no issue of fact exists as to whether the effect of the breach on mmwec was material and adversea material breach of a contract by one party generally excuses the other party from further performance   nevertheless parties to a contract may agree to further restrictions on the right to terminate their contract which we will enforce   accordingly section  of the ppa is enforceable as written and mmwec was required to show that the breach of the mustrun provision had both a material and an adverse effect on mmwec in order for it to terminate the agreement․we conclude that the ppa permitted termination only upon a showing that masspowers breach effected mmwec in a manner that was not only material but also detrimental unfavorable or contrary to its interests   without proof of both a material and an adverse effect on mmwec caused by masspowers refusal to seek mustrun of the facility termination of the contract is not an available remedy for breach of the mustrun provisionid at  citations omitted emphasis addedwith regard to the breach of contract claim therefore the appeals court has resolved in mmwecs favor the question whether masspower “failed in any material respect to comply with” its obligation under the ppa to “cooperate with mmwecs request to seek to have the facility declared ‘mustrun’ by nepool”   ppa §§     masspowers breach of contract claim thus rests upon whether its own breach had a “material and adverse” effect on mmwec   if so mmwec had the right to terminate the ppa and therefore did not breach it  if not then masspower has established liability on its contract claimfollowing the appeals court decision masspower moved with mmwecs assent to amend its complaint in this action to add an abuse of process claim   the court allowed the motion on september     on december   the court decided the parties respective dispositive motions   see memorandum of decision and order on dispositive motions fabricant j december  order   the court stated that with regard to masspowers contract claim the appeals court had determined that a genuine dispute of material fact existed “ ‘on the question of whether masspowers refusal to cooperate in seeking to operate the facility as a mustrun had an effect that was adverse ie detrimental unfavorable or contrary to mmwecs interests’ ”  id at  quoting appeals court decision at    the court then notes  “the appeals court then remanded the case for trial on that issue as well as other identified issues to be discussed infra ”   december  order at  emphasis suppliedthe remaining issues which the court in that order identifies for trial are   whether mmwec “exercised its right to demand mustrun for the purpose of extracting a benefit to which it was not entitledthat is buyout of the contract at a discounted price” citing anthonys pier four inc v hbc assocs  mass    id at    whether “evidence that both sides continued to contemplate buyout and to communicate about the possibility such that mmwec would have had a continuing interest in negotiating leverage ․ combined with the statements made by some of mmwecs participants could support a finding of ulterior purpose”id at   and  damages from any abuse of processthe december  order notwithstanding masspower contends in its pretrial memorandum of law masspowers pretrial memorandum submitted february   that “any breach by masspower was not ‘material’ ” id at  as discussed above that issue was resolved against masspower before trialmasspowers pretrial memorandum also posits an additional issue for trial   it contends that ppa §  “precludes termination for breaches that are ‘due to causes ․ attributable to mmwecs wrongful act or failure to act” and that “mmwecs failure to ‘cooperate’ with masspower under the mustrun clause is such a ‘failure to act’ or a ‘wrongful act’ and therefore precluded termination”   masspowers pretrial memorandum at  masspower points to §  of the ppa which it says “requires ‘cooperation’ in the event that mmwec and any other purchasers ‘decide to seek to have the facility declared “mustrun” by nepool’ ”  idsection  provides that “seller masspower agrees to cooperate with buyer mmwec and the other purchasers if they decide to seek to have the facility declared ‘mustrun’ by nepool”   not only does §  expressly place the obligation to “cooperate” on masspower but the scope and objective of such cooperation is narrow ie to “have the facility declared ‘mustrun’ by nepool”   nowhere in §  is any obligation placed on mmwec to cooperate with masspower in agreeing to an alternative to mustrun ie in masspowers words to “discuss  an admittedly feasible offer to provide the equivalent of mustrun from other plants that would not go bankrupt”   masspowers pretrial memorandum at  yet masspower argues that mmwecs “secret  decision not to pursue the offer and despite its admitted ability to do so declining to meet until after it had terminated the contract” id amounted to “bad faith and failure to cooperate constituting a ‘failure to act’ or a ‘wrongful act’ that either excused any breach at common law or at a minimum under the express terms of ppa §  precluding mmwec from terminating”  id at  section  simply does not support masspowers argumentfrom the foregoing the court concludes that as to each of the four counts of the first amended complaint the following were live and largely overlapping issues at trial and remain to be determined by the courti  breach of contract   because as a matter of law §  does not obligate mmwec to “cooperate” with masspower in seeking an alternative equivalent or otherwise to mustrun the court rejects masspowers contention that the issue was to be determined at trial   moreover masspowers material breach of §  is established   accordingly the only issues to be determined after trial on masspowers contract claim are  whether masspowers breach of §  “materially and adversely” affected mmwec  and if not  masspowers damagesii breach of implied covenant   the issues to be determined are  whether mmwec exercised its right to demand mustrun unfairly or in bad faith and abused the legal process by filing the mmwec action for the purpose of extracting a benefit to which it was not entitledthat is a buyout of the contract at a discounted price  and if so  masspowers damagesiii violation of c a the issues to be determined are  whether mmwec unfairly or deceptively exercised its right to demand

mustrun and filed the mmwec action for the purpose of disrupting the sale of masspower and thereby gaining leverage in its buyout negotiations with masspower  and if so  masspowers damagesiv abuse of process   the issues to be determined are  whether mmwec filed the mmwec action for the purpose of disrupting the sale of masspower and thereby gaining leverage in its buyout negotiations with masspower  and if so  masspowers damagesfindings of factthe parties have in response to the courts request submitted their “compilation of undisputed facts within the parties posttrial proposed findings of fact” undisputed facts which sets forth the proposed facts of each party which the other does not dispute  on the basis of those undisputed facts the facts established in prior proceedings as set forth above and the credible evidence at trial and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the court finds as followsi backgroundmasspower is a general partnership organized under the laws of massachusetts   masspowers principal physical asset is an electric generating unit located in springfield massachusetts facility or plant   the original partners of masspower were j makowski bay state gas tenneco gas pipeline general electric and us generating co which was a partnership of pacific gas  electric and bechtel   in addition to their equity interests the original partners all had additional roles  j makowski developed the masspower project  bay state laid a mile gas pipeline to the plant  tenneco owned gas pipelines serving the plant  general electric provided equipment and operations and maintenance personnel  and bechtel built the plantat the time that the ppa was signed the partners of masspower were masspower inc   springfield generating company lp  mp cogen inc   bay state energy development inc   and tenneco independent power i company   these entities were subsidiaries of the original partnersthe current owners and general partners of masspower are bg mp partners i llc and bg mp partners ii llc both of which are limited liability companies organized under the laws of delaware   following a sale transaction on may   each is an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of bg north america llc an affiliate of bg group plc a publicly traded international energy company headquartered in the united kingdombg mp partners i llc and bg mp partners ii llc are the same entities that were formerly known as silver ship mp partners llc and silver ship mp partners ii llc  those entities merely changed their names to the names by which they are currently known after a transfer of ownership of their parent entities   the silver ship entities now known by the bg names became the general partners of masspower on december   by collectively purchasing all interests of the previous partners known as the “houston” partners   both the original partnership agreement at article  and the massachusetts uniform partnership act gl c a §  authorize transfers of partnership interests   that transfer of ownership of the partnership interest had no effect on partnership property which remained in the partnership   see gl c  §  accordingly the court has rejected mmwecs theory that masspower can prove no injury resulting from its suit because its present owners are not the ones who were harmed   december  order at the undisputed facts establish that the named plaintiffs are the proper parties to assert the claims herein   december  order at masspower owns a “combined cycle” plant that utilizes ge frame  turbine technology   combined cycle operation is a fuelefficient way of creating electricity in which gasfired turbines produce electricity and the heat generated during this process is used to boil water which generates steam that runs through a steam turbine to produce additional electricity   masspower also sells the steam generated through this process to a chemical manufacturerthe plant operates primarily on natural gas but has a permit to burn oil for  days per year   the plant has only limited oil storagethe generating capacity of the entire plant is  megawatts in the summer period and  megawatts in the winter perioddefendant massachusetts municipal wholesale electric company “mmwec” was created by statute st c  and is a public corporation of the commonwealth of massachusetts   mmwecs purpose is to plan acquire and establish independent electric power supply on behalf of municipal light departments and other electric utilities   mmwec acts as a wholesaler of electric energy and either purchases energy in bulk or participates in the ownership of all or part of electric generating facilitiesmmwec resells electricity to its members and to other municipals in massachusetts and other statesmmwec is a joint action agency created by the legislature to plan finance and acquire power supply resources on behalf of massachusetts cities and towns that have their own light departments   st c among other things mmwec purchases electricity at wholesale and resells it to its members which are all massachusetts municipal light departments   massachusetts municipal wholesale electric company v town of danvers  mass   essentially mmwec is a vehicle through which its members which typically are small can pool their resources to obtain the economic benefits of purchasing electricity in bulk  id masspower and mmwec are both engaged in trade or commerce in massachusetts with respect to the power purchase agreement between themii formation of the ppaon april   mmwec and masspower entered into an agreement for the sale of net capability and corresponding energy by and between masspower and massachusetts municipal wholesale electric company “the ppa”   the ppa was amended on april  the ppa was a contract between sophisticated and wellrepresented partiesby its terms the ppa was an integrated agreement   section  statesthis agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and all previous agreements discussions communications and correspondence with respect to the subject matter hereof are superseded by the execution of this agreementunder the ppa mmwec agreed to purchase  of the generating capacity and electric energy of the masspower plant for a term of twenty years starting on the defined “commercial date” the “commercial date” occurred on august     the ppa absent early termination was therefore not due to expire until august  since the summer rating of the plant was  megawatts and the winter rating was  megawatts mmwecs purchase of  of the plants generating capacity averaged approximately  megawattspursuant to separate agreements that essentially passed through masspowers charges under the ppa along with mmwecs administrative expenses mmwec resold the electric capacity and energy purchased from masspower to municipal light departments serving the towns of littleton wakefield groton ipswich and ashburnham and the city of holyoke   these agreements were executed on april   more than a year before the execution of the ppa on april  holyoke purchased  of mmwecs entitlement  littleton   wakefield   ipswich   groton   and ashburnham under the contracts with these municipal light departments referred to as “participants” mmwec agreed to sell to the participants the net capability and electricity purchased from masspower under the ppaby law municipal light departments have an obligation to serve the residents and businesses in the city or town in which they operateeach light department is subject to the direction and control of a municipal light board the members of which are elected by the city or town residents that the light department serves  gl c  §§  the ppa was signed before the plant was built and mmwec understood that one of its purposes was to help secure project financingthe ppa imposed upon mmwec the obligation to pay two types of charges  fixed and variablethe fixed charges which were payable regardless of whether the facility was actually operating and generating electricity included a capacity charge designed to help masspower recover the facilitys capital costsmmwec was required to pay the capacity charge as long as masspower was available for dispatch even if masspower was not selected for dispatchthe capacity charge provision obligated mmwec to make a minimum monthly capacity payment as long as the plant was available to run at least  of the time during the preceding oneyear period   this payment had to be made regardless of whether the plant actually ran or notthe plant has a historical availability of approximately in contrast to the fixed charges the variable charges changed according to facility operation and included a fuel charge that correlated to mmwecs  share of the fuel costs actually incurred by masspower to operate the facility and generate electricitylike any longterm contract requiring the payment of fixed charges the ppa presented the risk that at any point in time the amount to be paid by mmwec might be well above or well below the market value of the electricity and capacity to be sold by masspower   in other words the ppa presented the risk that at any given time either mmwec or masspower might be “out of the market”the ppa also provided for a “bonus” to masspower for increased operation in the form of an increase in the capacity charge adjustment factor or “ccaf” if the plants “monthly actual dispatch hours” were  or more of the total number of hours in a month   in that event the ccaf has increased from  to as much as  which number is multiplied by the base capacity charge to determine the total capacity charge billed to mmwecthe calculation of “actual dispatch hours” is different from the calculation of “capacity factor”   any hour when the plant is dispatched to run constitutes an actual dispatch hour   the capacity factor by contrast is the amount of generation actually produced by a generator over some period of time as a fraction of the total amount of energy that could have been produced from the unit based on its maximum available capacity   thus running all  hours in a month at  operation level would yield a capacity factor of  and a monthly actual dispatch of the system operator could elect not to dispatch masspower even if masspower requested to mustrun or “self schedule” the plant   the system operators primary concern was safety and reliability which could overrule other dispatch considerationsunder §  of the ppa mmwec was to pay a pro rata share of masspowers commodity cost of fuel which correlates to the actual generation of electricity   this charge for the cost of the gas itself was a variable cost   mmwec also paid its pro rata share of the cost of transporting fuel to the plantat the time that the ppa was being negotiated masspower was expected to and it later did make longterm contracts to transport fuel from canada and everett massachusetts that it would be purchasing from suppliers progas and distrigas respectively   these transportation contracts had fixed “reservation” charges for reserving space on the pipeline   the charges had to be paid regardless of whether the plant ran and burned gasthe fuel supply contracts which were ultimately executed in august of  did not provide for fixed prices  rather the fuel prices under the contracts varied monthly with certain market indices   periodically if masspower and its suppliers could not agree on new pricing terms the contracts required arbitration of those terms returning the prices to the market pricein addition to executing the ppa with mmwec masspower executed power purchase agreements with three investorowned utilities ious western massachusetts electric company wmeco boston edison company beco and commonwealth electric company comelecbeco and comelec later became part of nstarwmeco and nstar are subject to the supervision and control of the department of public utilities dpu a state agency charged with protecting consumer interests  gl c  §§ iii nepoolnepool has had at all relevant times a system operator whose function includes balancing electric generation with fluctuating electric demand or load in the regionat the time the parties executed the ppa in  the nepool system operator was the new england power exchange nepex   isonew england inc isone replaced nepex in within nepool member utilities are financially debited for the electricity consumed by their respective loads for example by residents and businesses in littleton and are credited for the electricity that they provide either from generating units they own themselves or have under contractat all relevant times the six participating municipals were members of the poolat the time the parties formed the ppa and throughout the period before mmwec terminated the ppa masspower was not a member of the pool payments between masspower and mmwec were separate from the pool settlement system   it was only in the late summer of  after mmwec terminated the ppa that masspower became a member of the poolwhenever the masspower facility was available and ordered to run by nepex later isone the six participating municipals received credit for  of the masspower energy delivered to nepexisone in an hourthe pool separately credits its members for the capacity of the plants that a utility owns or has under contract when they are available to generate even if they do not runmmwecs ppa with masspower thus helped the six participating municipals meet their capacity obligations to the poolppa §  specifies that “the facility will be available for dispatch by nepex in accordance with the nepool agreement and that the facility will be deemed a dispatchable unit for purposes of economic dispatch by nepex․”  a “dispatchable” facility was one that operated only when nepex determined that it should do sothis meant that subject to the grid operators control for system safety and reliability the plant was to run when selected by the grid operator based on its comparative incremental expense of generation in relation to other plants as calculated in accordance with nepool rulesthe grid operator which was nepex at the time the parties entered the ppa would decide when the masspower plant would be turned on and at what level of output it would operatethe general aim of those rules was to select plants with the lowest cost of production firstgenerally speaking therefore the facilities with the lowest incremental cost were selected for operation or “dispatched” before facilities with higher incremental costs   appeals court decision at  through this system of “economic dispatch” nepex was able to achieve reliable electricity supply for the region for the least costthe cost of producing electricity is the product of two variable factors  a the cost of fuel to run the facility and b the facilitys efficiency in converting that fuel to electricity   the efficiency of a generating facility in converting fuel to electricity is referred to as its heat rate   heat rate is the number of british thermal units btus needed to generate one kilowatthour of electricityfuel cost was the primary factor in determining incremental cost   the lower the dispatchable facilitys fuel costs the lower the facilitys incremental cost and other things being equal the more it was dispatched by nepexother factors considered by nepex in determining whether to dispatch a facility included the operating characteristics of the facilitythe startup time the minimum run time and any minimum downtimein contrast to a dispatchable facility a mustrun facility was one that operated when the facility owner or operator determined to “selfschedule” the facility to run independent of its incremental cost   a mustrun facility typically operated virtually continually except when system safety reliability or maintenance required the facility to cease operationa mustrun facility sometimes operated when it was not economic to do so ie in circumstances where the incremental costs of generating electricity exceeded the price at which the electricity generated could be sold in the marketin addition there is an industrywide characterization of facilities that is based on the frequency with which the facilities operate  “baseload” facilities typically operate from  of the time   they usually have high fixed costs and low variable costs   when the fixed costs are spread over many hours of operation the total cost per megawatt hour mwh is relatively low   “intermediate” facilities operate from roughly  of the time up to  of the time   they have moderate fixed and variable costs   they are the most economic way to supply the energy that occurs during weekday onpeak or business hours  “peaking” facilities operate from  to  of the time   they have low fixed costs and high variable costsin the late s nepool was restructuredin  iso new england inc isone succeeded nepex as the central system operator   in may  isone changed the procedure for the dispatch of dispatchable facilities discarding the old nepool regulations for calculating dispatch rank order under “economic dispatch”   instead of selecting the facilities to be dispatched based on the facilities incremental costs isone began selecting the facilities to be dispatched based on an auctionstyle system of bids submitted by the facilities operatorsgenerally stated under this system isone ranks the bids it receives from lowest to highest until enough generation is bid to meet the new england demand for electricity in any given hour   the highest bid necessary to meet demand establishes the “clearing price” also sometimes referred to as the “locational marginal price” or “lmp”if a facility bid is below the clearing price isone selects that facility for dispatch   if a facility bid exceeds the clearing price isone does not select that facility for dispatchthe facilities that clear ie are chosen for dispatch are paid the clearing price for each megawatt hour they generateisone administers two markets for electricity  the day ahead market and the real time marketfor the day ahead market each generator in new england submits bids by noon each day reflecting the prices at which it is willing to operate for each hour of the next day beginning at noonthe generators that clear in the day ahead market are scheduled to operate the next day and receive the day ahead hourly clearing prices for the mwhs they generateif a generator is not selected to run in the day ahead market isone can call upon it to run the next day in the real time market   isone dispatches generators in real time based on their bids to balance the available supply of electricity with the demand for electricitythe generators that run in the real time market are paid the real time clearing price ie the price bid by the last facility dispatched in real time during the hourthe primary difference between economic dispatch by nepex in  and economic dispatch by isone today is that in  economic dispatch was a costbased process whereas today it is a marketbased processself scheduling or mustrunning a facility means that for some period of time the facility must be online operating and cannot be shut down absent reliability or safety problems or required maintenancethe owner does not need to schedule ie mustrun the facility to operate every hour of the year but can designate an hourtohour scheduleiv masspowers participation in the new isone auction marketthe ppa vests operational responsibility for the plant with masspower and does not dictate the content of bids   masspower itself has always prepared the calculation of the bidsafter the new market came into effect and with the support of mmwec and the other purchasers masspower submitted bids on a weighted average of the economic interests opportunity costs of masspower and its contract purchasers   this meant that a portion of the bid was based on the variable charges under the beco contract which was based on indices not actual fuel costs  the wmeco and comelec purchase agreements for which the same was true  the ppa  and with respect to the unsubscribed portions masspowers opportunity to resell any gas that had been purchased under its fuel supply contractmmwec knew of this method and did not objectmmwec benefitted from masspowers use of its fuel resale opportunities in calculating its bid because any resale proceeds were shared with mmwec pro ratamasspowers bids needed to account for the risk inherent in the nature and structure of the gas and electricity marketsbecause generators are required daily to submit a dayahead bid unto the pool if a generator anticipates that isone will select its plant to run in the dayahead electricity market the generator will buy gas in the dayahead gas market at  am and derive and submit its bid to isone by noon   however the generator will not learn whether it has actually been selected by isone in the dayahead electricity market until  pmmasspower therefore faced the risk that if it bought dayahead gas and isone did not select it to run it would need to resell or “lay off” the gas it had purchased in the dayahead gas market at a loss in the intraday marketin addition because masspower needed to reserve space on the gas pipelines to transport the dayahead gas to its facility masspower could incur pipeline penalties for gas that it could not use  the penalties were often larger than the cost of the gas itself   mmwec would bear its pro rata portion of any such penaltyif masspower anticipates that isone will not select masspowers plant in the dayahead electricity market it does not purchase gas in the dayahead gas market and instead formulates its dayahead bid into the pool based on its prediction of the price for gas in the intraday gas market which generally tends to be a higher price than the published dayahead gas price   if the plant were then chosen to run masspower would need to purchase gas in the volatile intraday gas market   if masspower has to pay an actual intraday gas price that exceeds its anticipated cost masspower might run at a loss for that day to be shared pro rata by mmwec   masspower and mmwec faced the same risk if masspower had not purchased dayahead gas and was selected to run in the realtime electricity marketthus masspower and mmwec were subject to shared losses on those occasions when masspower wrongly predicted the intraday gas pricesnevertheless when energy prices were high relative to the cost of fuel masspowers plant was selected to run based on its bid and mmwec profited from the difference between the value of energy and the cost of fuelduring periods when it had longterm gas supply contracts but was not running masspower would resell the natural gas that it had purchased under contract but had not burned and credit mmwec with a pro rata share of the proceeds   mmwec was aware of this practice and did not objectif masspower was selected to run after it had resold the natural gas purchased under a firm contract it would purchase spot gas from the market   mmwec was also aware of this practice and did not objectmasspowers participation in the isone auction market became problematical as the restructuring of nepool resulted in a building boom of new construction of more efficient power plants   the new plants had a lower heat rate that is they required less natural gas to generate the same amount of electricityaccordingly the new plants could submit relatively lower bids the result of which was that masspower was not selected to run as frequentlywhen masspower was not selected mmwec avoided the variable fuel costs it was required to pay under the ppa and avoided paying the capacity bonuson the other hand the building boom lowered the market price of capacity making the ppas capacity payments more expensive than replacement capacity that mmwec would have been able to purchase from the market   because of that and the fact that it was paying a relatively high capacity charge to masspower at the same time as masspower was being selected less and less frequently by isone mmwec concluded that the ppa had become economically disadvantageousaccordingly the prospect of a buyout of the ppa became attractive to mmwecv deregulation of the electric utility industryin  the legislature restructured and deregulated the massachusetts electric industry to allow consumers the option of purchasing their electricity from suppliers other than their local utility known as “retail choice”prior to enactment of the restructuring legislation ious like wmeco and nstar had an obligation to serve customers within their franchise areas and would either generate electricity or purchase it to supply to their customers   the legislation changed that by separating the generation of electricity from its delivery   now ious function primarily to distribute to their customers electricity generated by other entities and to provide service to their customersto facilitate its restructuring of the role of ious the legislation gave ious strong incentives to sell their generating facilities   it also gave ious incentives to buyout or terminate abovemarket power purchase agreementsin particular the legislation authorized ious to recover the abovemarket costs of any such contracts from their retail customers thereby shifting the costs and risks associated with abovemarket contracts from the ious shareholders to the ious retail customerssignificantly the legislation allowed the ious to finance the buyout of above market power purchase contracts through “securitization”   the legislation authorized two state agencies the massachusetts industrial finance agency and the massachusetts health and education finance authority to issue taxexempt “rate reduction” bonds to finance the buyout of the ious power purchase agreements and to secure repayment of the bonds by an irrevocable charge levied on the ious customersthe restructuring legislation did not apply to mmwec or the light department participantsconsequently the restructuring legislation provided no direct incentives to mmwec or the participants to terminate above market power purchase agreements   the participants continued to have longterm service obligations to their customers and therefore needed longterm resources including power purchase agreements to meet those service obligationsvi masspowers other purchasers buy out their ppasas noted above after executing the ppa in  masspower signed longterm power purchase agreements with beco comelec and wmeco for all but about five percent of the remaining output of the facilitymasspowers agreements with beco comelec and wmeco differed from the ppa in price terms   whereas mmwec paid a flat  of masspowers fuel costs the other purchasers paid prices set by contract and not tied to masspowers actual fuel costsaccordingly with respect to bidding or pricing the plant for dispatch and procuring fuel masspowers economic interests were most aligned with mmwecs and the two parties in that respect stood “shoulder to shoulder”masspower took advantage of the incentives in the restructuring legislation by negotiating buyouts of its power purchase agreements with wmeco and nstarthe buyout of the wmeco agreement was consummated on may     masspower received approximately  millionon june   masspower signed an agreement with nstar pursuant to which nstar agreed to pay masspower  million to buy out its power purchase agreement   the nstar buyout was completed on march  vii the mustrun clauseat the time the ppa was negotiated the nepool rules permitted plants to opt out of the “economic dispatch” rules and undertake mustrun that is to operate irrespective of selection under those rules unless otherwise proscribed by technical concernsunder the nepool rules a plant could be mustrun whenever it was available or alternately for limited periods even just a few hours or months on end   in addition a plant could be mustrun for only a portion of its capacity rather than full outputduring negotiations for the ppa mmwec had concerns regarding the fixed charges which it deemed high   mmwec worried that it might end up paying the high fixed charges even though the facility was not being frequently selected for dispatchmmwec therefore asked masspower to guarantee that the facility would be dispatched frequently as a baseload facilitymasspower refused mmwecs request for a guarantee of plant dispatch because over the twentyyear term of the ppa dispatch would depend on many variables not under masspowers control   masspower emphasized that while it was willing to take availability risk for the entire capacity charges it could not guarantee dispatch which it could not control   all parties agreed that masspowers pricing should result in baseload dispatch   they also acknowledged that baseload dispatch for the entire twentyyear term rested on many variablesas a compromise the parties negotiated the mustrun clause §  which providesdispatch  the parties agree that the facility will be available for dispatch by nepex in accordance with the nepool agreement and that the facility will be deemed a dispatchable unit for purposes of economic dispatch by nepex ․ in the event that the facility is dispatched at a capacity factor of less than sixty percent over a two year period seller agrees to cooperate with buyer and the other purchasers if they decide to seek to have the facility declared “mustrun” by nepoolviii the defaulttermination clauseas discussed in detail above section  of the ppa provides for termination by mmwec in the event of specified defaults by masspower   that section statesdefaulttermination  if i seller shall fail in any material respect to comply with observe perform or shall default in any material respects upon any obligation under this agreement except due to causes excused by force majeure or attributable to buyers wrongful act or failure to act and such failure materially and adversely affects buyer and ii after written notice thereof to seller ․ such failure is not cured or sought to be cured within  days then buyer may by notice in writing terminate this agreement as of the date of such notice․ix  negotiations for buyout of the ppa through a negotiations prior to as early as  when the electric superintendent of holyoke gas  electric department brian beauregard became involved in the ppa he was concerned about the ppas escalating costsin  the parties briefly discussed a possible buyout but made no progress because they were too far apart   mmwec remained interested in a buyout however as masspower negotiated and ultimately consummated buyouts from its other purchasersmmwec and its participants met in april of  to explore whether there were any steps short of a buyout which could address mmwecs escalating costs under the ppa at that meeting beauregard broached the question whether mmwec could “break” or terminate the ppa he was advised by roger bacon mmwecs director of power supply that there was no way that mmwec could terminate the contract without cause and that he found nothing in the contract that would provide causethus with no basis for terminating the contract mmwec remained interested in a buyout as did masspower but the parties remained too far apartbeauregard and scott edwards assistant manager of littleton electric light  water department were the prime movers behind mmwecs efforts to buy out the ppa as part of their costreduction efforts   their employers holyoke and littleton respectively would be responsible for the largest shares and  respectivelyof any buyout amount paid to masspowerlike masspower mmwec had entered buyout agreements of other power purchase agreements to which it was a partyin a typical power purchase contract buyout negotiation the parties premise the negotiations on sharing a pool or “pot” of money that is created by the differential between the parties respective costs of money   in a typical voluntary contract buyout negotiation the pot was shared  or b buyout negotiations and the parties dealings in in the spring of  masspower advised mmwecs bacon that buyout negotiations with nstar for the remaining contracts were underway and that it might be an advantageous time for mmwec to negotiate as wellon may   masspowers general manager jeffrey bentz and its consultant david nickerson met with bacon the discuss a possible buyout   bentz suggested a price of approximately  million and bacon suggested  millionbacons figure was not a reflection of mmwecs actual view at the time of the abovemarket value of the ppa rather bacon had determined that the net present value of the ppa at mmwecs discount rate was in the range of  or  million and he believed that the right buyout value would be between  and  million   however to keep the conversation “realistic” he suggested a number of  million in the hope that the parties would end up around the midpoint between that and masspowers  million figure   the figures were preliminary not firm offers or demandsless than a month after that meeting masspower and nstar signed their agreement to buy out the beco and comelec power purchase agreements   that agreement was subject to state regulatory review to ensure that it was in the ratepayers interestwhen mmwec sought to intervene in the regulatory review nstar told it that if mmwec blocked approval nstar would look to it for damages   mmwec backed off   the court is not persuaded on the evidence offered by masspower that mmwec sought to intervene for the purpose of gaining leverage in its own buyout negotiations with masspower and so makes no such findingfollowing the may  meeting the municipal participants demanded to and did direct and control the buyout negotiations with masspower   the participants could do so because they dominated mmwecs board of directors and therefore controlled mmwecby may   the mmwec board included representatives from four of the six participants in the ppa  ipswichs raymond shockey ashburnhams stanley herriott holyokes james lavelle and littletons scott edwards   grotons doris chojnowski joined the board in bacon edwards and beauregard constituted mmwecs negotiating committee for buyout discussions with masspowerin the fall of  mmwec recognized that the ppa was very valuable to masspower   the town of littleton had hired a consultant mayhew seavey who calculated that the ppa had an abovemarket value of  millionon september   masspower wrote to mmwec to make a formal buyout offer of  million   this offer was comparable in assumptions and ratepayer savings to the buyout agreement that masspower had negotiated with nstarmmwecs staff reviewed the proposal and discovered several “errors” in masspowers assumptions underlying the  million buyout price   adjusting those “errors” and using mmwecs own market value forecast “the buyout amount declines to  million dollars ․ additional changes in the spreadsheets assumptions may further reduce the net buyout amount”   bacon september   memorandum to participants trial ex  at   mmwec and masspower representatives met on september   to discuss masspowers proposal and the negotiation process going forward   prior to the meeting the participants had determined that they wanted a buyout price in the range of  to  millionmasspower stated that its objective in providing its  million proposal to mmwec was to “have a deal that very closely resembled what nstar negotiated”   beauregards minutes ex      among masspowers key assumptions was that its proposal would generate “a ratepayer savings of  using nstars public discount rate of  they stated that they assumed that the participants customers would be on par with the savings realized from nstars customers”   idat the meeting beauregard stated that “the  discount factor could be a deal breaker even if we could agree on all the rest of the assumptions throughout the model   it is not attractive enough for our customers ․” id at beauregard also reminded masspower that “there is a  capacity factor that must be maintained over a rolling  year period otherwise mmwec could strike a must run scenario”  id at    this remark drew a sharp response from bentz who stated that “this could be a legal strategy that mmwec could pursue and they understand thatbut ․ that would you really want to bleed just to make us bleed more”  idbeauregard and timothy peet mmwecs senior project manager “very clearly identified to masspower that other than legal which is certainly a factor for us there are very real reasons why we would want to must run this unit in the future”   they identified the following reasons   the ability to have the unit clear in the day ahead market for the weekday period “would be considerably more advantageous to our group as a known factor than have the unit miss most of the day ahead scheduling due to the plants large startup costs and other interest factors that would cause the unit not to run” and  for six of twelve months mustrunning would be an “insurance premium” as a hedge against power spikes and otherwise costly peaking power  idpeet testified however the first reason applied only to weekday peak periods and the second was not valid because “the cost of the premium to mustrun the unit when fuel costs are above lmp market cost of electricity just to provide a hedge against a possible price spike would be too great of a cost”   trial transcript vol at   nor did peet believe that mustrunning the plant at full output continuously was in mmwecs interest  id at   see findings below as to both pointsmmwecs broaching of the mustrun option as a factor which masspower should consider was a shot across masspowers bow intended to increase the pressure on masspower to lower its proposed buyout pricethere was considerable dissension within mmwec regarding the wisdom of threatening the mustrun option let alone any benefit such an option could deliver for mmwec   bacons view was that under the marketbased system in place in september  “mustrun is suicide   its nuts   you dont do it   the only reason you mustrun a generator is because you have an offsetting economic value theres a gas contract that youre forced to purge you have to get it out of your portfolio”   tr   in other words mustrun operation would lose money in a market system when the cost of fuel exceeded the marginal value of the power generated   mmwecs staff and consultants explained as much to participants representatives including herriott beauregard and edwards   as found below however the participants had additional reasons for considering a demand for mustrunthe participants were also advised that mustrun would probably hurt masspower much more than the participants   ex      while mmwec was purchasing  of the plants output masspower would be responsible for the other mmwec had other concerns about a buyout   participants were wary of paying money to buy out the contract when they thought the facility might not continue to operate through the term of the ppa ie until moreover mmwec doubted masspowers assumption that the capacity factor would at times exceed  and that the participants ratepayers would benefit from a deal modeled on the nstar buyout   to achieve the savings for their customers attained by nstar for its shareholders the participants estimated that they needed savings to ratepayers of  rather than the  built into the nstar buyout   the participants were also unhappy with masspowers allocation to them of only  of the “pot” of money created by the difference between masspowers and mmwecs costs of moneymmwec did not make any buyout offer to masspower in the months following the september   meeting   mmwec was waiting for more information from masspower and masspower was waiting for a bid from mmwec   at the time the participants believed that an appropriate buyout price was in the range of at most  millionduring the last quarter of  beauregard and edwards again discussed with other mmwec participants simply “breaking the contract” if masspower did not substantially reduce its price   bacon on the other hand saw no basis on which to walk away from the ppano meetings between masspower and mmwec took place between september  and march on january   masspower again contacted mmwec and proposed a meeting to discuss ppa restructuring optionson february   masspower contacted littleton   littleton told masspower that it believed an appropriate buyout amount was less than  million   however littleton agreed to consider a replacement contract   the parties exchanged proposed replacement contractson march   masspower and mmwec met   masspower made a presentation comparing the alternative buyout proposals and concluded that the gap between masspower and mmwec was quite largemasspower requested an indication of the buyout price reduction needed to achieve a buyout agreement   mmwec responded that agreement on a buyout would require projected customer savings of    mmwec had obtained similar discounts in other power purchase agreement buyoutsafter the march  meeting the parties exchanged counteroffers relating to replacement contracts   mmwec and masspower met again on march     masspower presented three options each assessed by mmwec as being about  million above marketultimately negotiations regarding a buyout of the ppa or a replacement contract were unsuccessful and ended in an impasse in march as noted above on june   masspower and nstar had signed an agreement to buy out the beco and comelec agreements   once the nstar buyout was approved and the buyout was consummated nstar would no longer be the “lead participant” for masspower ie the party that handled the submission of daily bids into the poolmasspower alleges that mmwec specifically littleton caused “logistical problems by withholding routine paperwork relating to the transfer of the ‘lead participant’ ” for masspower from nstar to fpl energy power marketing inc fpl  masspowers posttrial submission at  et seqafter reviewing the evidence the court does not accept masspowers contention   rather the court finds that despite internal discussions to the contrary mmwec participants reacted in the end in a timely manner to the requirements placed on them by masspower regarding the transfer   notwithstanding that finding the court also finds that beauregard and edwards considered whether they could hold up the transfer to gain leverage in the buyout negotiations but were persuaded that they had no basis for doing sox changes to the operation of masspowers facility in during the period from  to  masspower operated the facility at about  of its capacity and it was regularly selected for dispatch   in  masspower began selling the gas it purchased under the favorable fuel supply contracts instead of using the gas to operate the facility   by selling the gas masspower made more money than it would have by using ithowever because masspowers bids to isone were based on its opportunity costs the price it could get by selling the gas in the spot market rather than on the costs of natural gas under the long term fuel agreements the bids were so high that the facility was infrequently selected for dispatchas a result mmwec received significantly less electricity under the ppa even though the ppa required mmwec to continue to pay masspower  million annual fixed charges   on the other hand mmwec also benefitted from its pro rata share of the profits from masspowers fuel resalesalthough the decline in frequency of dispatch had begun before masspower terminated its longterm gas supply and transportation contracts in  the latter accelerated the drop in masspowers frequency of dispatch because masspower now had to compete with newer more efficient plants on the level field of the spot fuel marketxi mmwecs  action against masspowerthe court has previously discussed under “prior proceedings” above the  mmwec action   masspower claims that after it informed mmwec on may   that the plant and the ppa would be put up for sale in a competitive auction process mmwec “plotted to and did file a suit against masspower not for the purpose of obtaining the relief requested in its complaint but instead for the ulterior purpose of disrupting the planned sale of the masspower plant in order to get leverage in buyout negotiations”   masspowers posttrial submission at mmwec counters that in  when masspower began to change the way it operated the plant and dispatch began to decline mmwec undertook a legal review of the ppa some mmwec staff members and participants questioned whether the change in plant operation constituted a breach of masspowers obligations under the ppa  in addition some were concerned that masspower might sell the favorable longterm fuel supply contracts and believed that masspower had no right to do so under the ppain the fall of  mmwecs general counsel prepared a litigation memorandum and then a draft complaint   the litigation memorandum is not in evidence having been withheld as privilegedmmwec delayed filing the complaint while it was discussing a buyout of the ppa with masspowerin february  mmwec sent masspower two letters protesting the decline in facility dispatch and the corresponding harm to mmwecthose letters raised in bentzs mind “the possibility of litigation with mmwec especially if restructuring efforts were to fail”   ex   the minutes of a regular board of directors meeting of mmwec on may   state as followsminkos michael minkos mmwecs general manager reported that the masspower participants were unable to reach a settlement agreement with masspower on a buyout even after consideration of bringing in a third party to help facilitate a potential settlement   masspower has decided to put the plant up for sale including the mmwec contract   scobbo nicholas scobbo mmwecs general counsel has been asked by the masspower participants to look into legal obligations and any potential leverage   scobbo said that the participants in attendance at the mmwec annual meeting decided to recommend to the board to effectuate some legal action against masspower based on the legal issues addressed in the octobernovember timeframe as covered in a memorandum to the boarda motion was made by edwards seconded by herriott and it was unanimouslyvoted   to accept the masspower participants request and that themmwec board of directors hereby directs general counsel expeditiously to enter into a legal action with respect to masspower based on the same approach and strategy as addressed previouslyex    emphasis in originalmmwec filed the  action on june  masspower never brought a counterclaim asserting that mmwecs complaint was not advanced in good faithafter the trial masspower never moved for attorneys fees under gl c  § f on the ground that mmwecs action was insubstantial frivolous or not advanced in good faithafter reviewing the evidence and in particular evidence cited by masspower in its posttrial submission requests for findings nos  and by mmwec in its requests for findings nos   the court finds that mmwec brought the  action for the following purposes   to pursue colorable claims outlined by its attorney that masspower was not operating as a baseload facility as required by the ppa and that masspower was not entitled under the ppa unilaterally to sell its longterm fuel contracts  and  to disrupt masspowers announced plans to sell the facility so as to put pressure on masspower to resume buyout negotiations with mmwec and to gain leverage in such negotiations   the court further finds that had the latter purpose not existed mmwec would not have brought its  actionthe court need not repeat here every fact which masspower has proposed in support of the courts findings  the following findings are both sufficient and illustrativebetween masspowers may   advice to mmwec that it planned to auction the plant and the may   directors meeting mmwec conducted its annual meeting   at that meeting edwards beauregard and bacon discussed edwards view that filing a lawsuit might be successful in “removing the masspower contract from mmwecs power supplies”   tr      in that discussion both edwards and beauregard stated their opinions that “it was time to have a dialog with the other participants and general counsel the general manager on a litigation to disrupt the sale”  id at  their strategy was “that the disruption would lead to a lower cost of the buyout by effectively trying to give you another bargaining chip in the dialog”  idherriott mmwecs board chairman confirmed that the participants “were looking to use the tools we had to better our position” and that they knew that bringing the lawsuit “would kind of put a fly in the ointment” making it harder for masspower to sell the plant   tr      herriott characterized mmwecs goal in bringing the lawsuit as not having to begin negotiations all over with “a whole new group of people” ie new purchasers of the plant and the ppa id at    that goal also served mmwecs purpose of preventing a sale and thereby preserving the leverage over masspowers existing owners that such a strategy could ensurethe boards approval of litigation against masspower on may   was with full knowledge of the strategy which beauregard and edwards had raised with bacon and other participants at the annual meeting   as the minutes quoted above state attorney scobbo told the board that the participants had asked him “to look into legal obligations and any potential leverage” and had “decided to recommend to the board to effectuate some legal action against masspower ․” ex      while the basis for such litigation as stated in the minutes is “the legal issues addressed” in counsels  memorandum the court finds that the board was advised and approved of the participants strategy of initiating litigation to disrupt any sale thereby gaining leverage in forcing a buyout on mmwecs termsmmwecs  complaint sought a decree of specific performance requiring mmwec to operate the facility “as a base load unit and to deliver energy to mmwec regularly and without interruption”   ex      that prayer for relief while based on the language of the ppa §  was subject to interpretation as a demand that the plant be mustrunthe masspower partnership suffered damages as a direct and foreseeable result of the mmwec action in the form of legal expenses and seeks only its legal fees in connection with the mmwec actionjeffrey bentz masspowers general manager negotiated and monitored the legal expenses billed by masspowers counsel foley hoag in the mmwec action   he exacted a  discount from that firm   the legal expenses that masspower incurred in defending itself against the mmwec action were reasonable both in terms of the hours billed and the hourly rates chargedthe total amount of legal fees incurred by masspower is    of that amount plaintiffs paid onethird or about  pursuant to the december   purchase and sale agreement §  “mmwec escrow”mmwec contends that masspowers new owners benefitted from mmwecs lawsuit because they paid a lower price for the plant than they would have had mmwec not sued   masspower counters that mmwec is unable to quantify any positive effect that mmwecs wrongful lawsuit had upon masspowers general partners and accordingly that it would be speculative and improper to deduct from masspowers damages ie legal fees any amount for a reduced sale pricemasspower overstates mmwecs burden   mmwec must prove not the amount by which the eventual  million sale price was discounted from what masspowers purchasers would likely have paid absent the mmwec action but only that any such discount exceeded the amount of masspowers legal feeschristopher fleming one of the principals of masspowers new owners after the sale in  “testified that their company offered a lower price than they would have without the lawsuit but did not quantify any amount”   masspowers posttrial submission at    while such testimony “is not evidence of what the price would have been without a lawsuit” id it is evidence that the lawsuit caused some reduction in the sale pricemoreover although fleming did not “quantify any amount” of price reduction because of the pending litigation his testimony provides evidence of the magnitude of that reductionq․  did the pendency of the lawsuit have any impact on the price that silver ship was willing to pay for the masspower assetsa yesq what was that impacta the impact was that we knew that the other bidders were going to steeply discount the purchase price because of the pending litigationq so your testimony is then that silver ship was able to pay a lower price because of the lawsuita yesfleming dep ex k at while fleming did not quantify the amount of the discount his testimony supports the inference that knowing that other bidders would “steeply discount” the purchase price plaintiffs accordingly “steeply discounted” their own bid   the court finds that plaintiffs “steep discount” resulting in a purchase price of  million equaled more than the  million which masspower incurred in legal expenses and considerably more than the  which the new owners actually paid under the december   purchase and sale agreementxii mmwecs demand for mustrunduring the first few days of april  mmwec and the municipal participants learned that a new sale of the masspower project to bg group parent of the current owners bg was pendingmmwec understood in april  that if masspower were to switch from the economic dispatch mode to mustrun operation that would be less economically desirable from the perspective both of masspower and of any potential purchaser   therefore mmwec knew that demanding mustrun might disrupt the pending sale of masspower to bgkevin wright mmwecs power supply division manager asked michael lynch mmwecs manager of regulatory services and planning to perform an analysis of the economic effects of potential mustrun operation of the masspower facilitylynch prepared a preliminary study that included analyses of operations under mustrun and economic dispatch during a retrospective period from july   to march     his cover memo addressed to attorney scobbo copy to wright begins  “we have looked at masspowers operation vs their operating the plant x in a must run mode”   ex   lynchs results for the retrospective period assuming three different heat rates showed that mustrun compared to economic dispatch would have resulted in net losses for mmwec assuming heat rates of  and  and a net gain for an assumed heat rate of    his results for the prospective twelvemonth period may  to april  showed losses from must run compared to economic dispatch ranging from just under  assuming the most efficient heat rate to just over  million assuming the least   his analysis also predicted losses for masspower for the year ahead comparing mustrun to economic dispatch ranging from more than  million to  million   ex   lynch commented at the end of his report to scobbo and wright that “if we assume that the plant was must run using their bid prices there would be losses․  if the numbers for case c ie the retrospective economic dispatch results were computed on an hourly basis ie as bids were actually made over that period case c would have greater value”   the court infers from lynchs comments that using masspowers actual bids over the retrospective period would have shown greater losses assuming heat rates of  and  and a loss not a gain assuming the most efficient heat rate of lynch produced a final report with the following result  “the results of our analysis range from a small gain for mmwec to losses approaching  million”   ex      the latter figure reflected lynchs forwardlooking analysis which showed that for the succeeding twelve months “losses were calculated ranging from  to  depending on the heat rate used”   ex      lynch also reported that operating at greater than  capacity which was likely under a mustrun scenario would trigger mmwecs obligation to pay a capacity bonus under the ppa amounting to “ to  each month ․” ex    emphasis in originalthe final report also looked at the effect on masspower  “to determine the impact on the entire plant of being declared a mustrun facility we used masspowers bid prices rather than fuelbased prices and compared that to the average daily dayahead lmp at the masspower node     this resulted in a  million loss for the masspower facility over the study period july   through march  ”   ex      that figure represented masspowers  share of the overall loss   tr   littletons consultant seavey reviewed lynchs analysis and reported to edwards that lynchs analysis understated the losses to mmwec from switching to mustrunthe participants received lynchs report and understood that switching from economic dispatch to mustrun would likely cause them small gains or more likely modest lossesthe participants also understood that lynchs report assumed mustrun on a continuous basis and that mustrunning on peak hours only might have reduced or eliminated the projected lossesfollowing an “emergency” meeting of mmwec on april   at which lynch presented his report mmwecs board met on may     at that meeting the board voted to request mustrun under §  of the ppa the vote was supported by directors edwards of littleton herriott of ashburnham lavelle of holyoke and chojnowski of grotonon may   mmwecs general manager sent masspower a letter stating “pursuant to section  of the agreement mmwec hereby requests that masspower seek to have the facility ․ dispatched as a ‘mustrun’ or selfscheduled unit by isone effective upon receipt of this request”   ex the may   letter also states  “mustrun operation as defined the sic  nepool agreement has been superseded by self scheduling as defined in market rule  section iii of the isone ferc electric tariff no ” that section provides that “ ‘selfschedule’ means the action of a market participant in committing andor scheduling its resource ․ to provide service in an hour whether or not in the absence of that action the resource would have been scheduled or dispatched by the iso to provide the service”   ex the definition just quoted does not define over what period selfscheduling occurs   it is possible to self schedule a facility for certain hours or daysthe court finds that the ppa contemplated and mmwec intended that the facility “would be selfscheduled to run at all times short of whatever times it had to come offline either for a planned outage a forced outage or ․ maybe reliability purposes․  short of any of that its all the time   that was ․ our understanding when we submitted our letter of may  th”   beauregard dep tr  at    that was also masspowers justified interpretation of the letter and of the ppa the may   letter concludes  “take notice that masspowers failure or refusal to selfschedule the facility as a mustrun unit shall constitute a default under section  of the agreement for which mmwec intends to seek any remedies to which it is entitled including termination of the agreement”   ex   in a letter dated may   masspowers counsel conveyed masspowers rejection of mmwecs mustrun demandas noted above masspower materially breached §  of the ppa by refusing to seek to have its facility declared mustrun by isone   the court has also addressed above masspowers contentions regarding mmwecs alleged duty to “cooperate” with masspower in reaching an agreed alternative to mmwecs mustrun demandby letter dated july   mmwec notified masspower that because “masspowers failure to cause the facility to be dispatched as a mustrun unit has continued for a period of fortyfive days following mmwecs demand for mustrun mmwec is hereby terminating the agreement as provided in section  thereof”   ex      this action followedxiii bona fides of mmwecs demand for mustrunmasspower argues that mmwec knew of the pending sale to bg and knew that demanding mustrun might disrupt that sale  any potential purchaser would have known however in the course of due diligence that under §  mmwec was entitled to demand mustrun because the facility had been dispatched at a capacity factor of less than sixty percent over a two year period  that mmwec had threatened to do exactly that on a prior occasion  and that mmwec had expressed its unhappiness with the ppa in numerous ways over a course of years including filing the mmwec action in    in any event masspower has failed to prove any harm to either the process or the outcome of the  sale of masspower resulting from mmwecs mustrun demandmasspower also argues that mmwec decided to demand mustrun even though lynchs analysis showed that switching to mustrun would yield small economic gains at best and likely losses for mmwec and even though mmwec board members and municipal participant managers had conflicting explanations for demanding mustrunmmwec counters that the participants viewed the lynch report as a worstcase extreme scenario and that using different assumptions showed that the price of electricity to mmwec would be lower than mmwec was paying when masspower did operate the facilitythe evidence shows that the board members of mmwec and the managers of the municipal participants had varying degrees of understanding of the lynch report on the effects of mustrun and more generally of the potential advantages and disadvantages of invoking mustrun under §  nevertheless with regard to mmwecs may   demand for mustrun the court finds  that mmwec fully intended to follow through with having the facility declared mustrun so as to rid itself of a contract it viewed as requiring too much money for too little capacity and generation   that mmwec also intended that its demand for mustrun provide it leverage in any negotiations concerning a buyout of the ppa   that had the second intention not existed mmwec would still have demanded mustrun in order to achieve the first  and  that mmwec did not link its demand for mustrun to any demand for a discounted buyoutxiv whether masspowers refusal to mustrun “materially and adversely” affected mmwecmmwec defends its termination of the ppa by contending that masspowers breach of its obligation under §  “materially and adversely affected” mmwec entitling mmwec to terminate in accordance with §  thus argues mmwec its termination was not a breach of the ppa the court makes the following findings regarding mmwecs specific assertions of effects it alleges were both material and adverse ie “ ‘detrimental unfavorable or contrary to mmwecs interests’ ” december  order at  citing appeals court decision at a mmwec was deprived of the benefits of its bargainmmwec asserts that it entered into the ppa for the purpose of procuring baseload electricity and that masspowers refusal to mustrun was “detrimental and contrary to mmwecs interests because mmwec was paying masspower  million a year in fixed charges and getting virtually no electricity”   mmwecs posttrial proposed finding nos     moreover mmwec asserts mmwec was adversely affected by masspowers refusal to mustrun because it “deprived mmwec of the lower unit costs costmwh must running would have achieved”   id no as to the latter mmwecs expert philip hanser calculated that the unit cost cost per mwh of electricity from the masspower facility was mwh in   as the capacity factor of the facility declined the unit cost increased to mwh in  mwh in  and mwh in    under mustrun operation the cost per mwh would have been mwh in  mwh in  and mwh in as hanser admitted on cross examination he included mmwecs fixed costs in making his calculations even though he agreed that such costs which are due under the ppa whether the plant operates under economic dispatch or mustrun ought not to be considered in determining the incremental costs of switching to mustrun   tr   accordingly as to mmwecs first basis for asserting material and adverse effect the court finds  that masspowers refusal to mustrun the plant frustrated mmwecs purpose and expectation in agreeing to the ppa of procuring baseload electricity  because a baseload facility operates between  and  percent of the time and the mustrun provision in §  was in part a remedy for mmwec in the event the facilitys capacity fell considerably below that ie below  for two years running masspowers rejection of mmwecs mustrun demand deprived mmwec of the capacity for which it had bargained  and  that mmwec has not demonstrated that switching to mustrun would have lowered its per unit priceb mmwec was deprived of the power supply planning benefits of mustrun operationas entities supplying power to wholesale and retail customers respectively mmwec and the participants strive to have an integrated resource plan   the purpose of such a plan is to supply customers with least cost electricity over time   an integrated resource plan includes a power supply portfolio which typically includes power generated by facilities owned by the portfolio holder and power obtained through power purchase agreementsthe portfolio holder strives to have resources in place to supply a significant portion of its needs so as to avoid having to purchase power on the highly volatile spot market   in determining whether the portfolio is achieving the goal of providing least cost power over time the portfolio resources are considered collectively not separately   at any given time some portfolio resources might be above market and others might be below marketa long term power purchase agreement allows the purchaser to avoid having to make short term or spot purchases on the spot market   for this reason purchasers are willing to pay a premium to procure longterm contracts   thus including in a power supply portfolio a long term contract that provides protection against volatility even though expensive is not unusualindeed achieving stability in the rates charged to customers is one of the fundamental tenets of ratemaking and a primary goal of the participants   because customer rates are based on utility costs including the costs of procuring electricity supplies stability in the costs of electricity is critically important to mmwec and the participants in terms of their ability to offer stable rates to their customers and to avoid rate volatilitythe participants included the electricity to be generated by the facility in their electricity supply portfolios as a source of base load electricity that would help the participants maintain reasonable and predictable rates for their customersmasspowers refusal to mustrun had a material and adverse effect on the interests of mmwec and the participants because it subjected them to the uncertainty of purchasing electricity supplies on the volatile spot market and thus deprived them of the ability to advance their goal of maintaining stability in the rates charged to their customersc mmwec was deprived of a hedge against highly volatile spot market prices for electricity and of its right to overcome the facilitys high start up costs and high bidsbecause the participants commit the majority of their load in the day ahead market they want their resources also to be in the day ahead market to allow hedging ie to allow them to avoid having to make purchases in the volatile real time marketthe facility has the capability to cycle on and off but it cannot start up or shut down quickly   it has a fivehour startup time a hour minimum run time and then a shutdown timemmwec contends that mustrunning would have overcome masspowers high bids and would have allowed the plant to clear in the day ahead market providing a hedge against realtime electricity market power spikes or high price spikesmasspower contends that mmwec would have received no such benefit from mustrun operation because “economic dispatch already provided mmwec with a hedge against high dayahead market prices for electricity   that is so because isone selected the masspower plant to run when the dayahead market prices were high   masspowers posttrial submission proposed finding no in any event masspower contends because the participants committed their loads in the dayahead market not the real time market as a general matter they were not left “exposed” to realtime market prices for energy and so did not need a generation hedge in the realtime marketmasspower acknowledges however that “instances where isone did not dispatch masspower where it might have made economic sense were a ‘much more minor phenomenon ․’ ”ie that such instances nevertheless did occur   id proposed finding no mmwec concedes that the plants long startup and minimum run times necessary even during “continuous” mustrun operation reduced its ability to be an effective hedge in the real time marketon balance the court finds that masspowers refusal to mustrun was adverse to mmwec in that it deprived mmwec of a hedge against realtime price spikes and that the effect on mmwec was sufficiently significant to be materiald mmwec was deprived of increased efficiency of the facilitythe heat rate of the facility reflects its efficiency   generally speaking the more efficient the facility the lower the heat ratewhen the facility was operating at about an  capacity factor the average heat rate of the plant was about  btukwh   in  when the facility was being less frequently dispatched the heat rate climbed to about  btukwhin the period january through november  when the facility was being even less frequently dispatched the heat rate averaged approximately  btukwhif masspower had mustrun the facility so that it was operating at or near capacity on a regular basis and frequent start ups and shut downs were avoided the facility heat rate would have been reduced its efficiency would have improved and the cost of electricity it generated would have been lowerheat rate is not an independent consideration but is one input in the cost analysis   from that fact masspower argues that “an improved heat rate and more efficiency matter only if it ultimately results in lower overall costs to mmwec and the municipals”  id proposed finding no masspower defines the issue too narrowly   because as found above the participants included in their power supply portfolios “a long term contract that provides protection against volatility even though expensive” there was significant value to mmwec in increasing the plants efficiency and thereby lowering that expenseaccordingly masspowers refusal to must run was both material and detrimental to mmwecs interests because it deprived mmwec of the benefits of a lowered facility heat rate and corresponding decrease in the price of electricity under the ppae the participants were forced to secure expensive replacement contractsmmwec contends that when the facility capacity factor declined and thereafter masspower refused to mustrun the participants were forced to cover for the electricity they were not receiving   they had two options  fixed rate contracts and heat rate contractsin fact only littleton holyoke and groton purchased such contracts  the remaining participants “covered” loss of electricity from masspower by going to the pool littleton purchased heat rate contracts holyoke and groton fixed price contractsmmwec has not established that the “replacement” contracts purchased by littleton holyoke and groton were more expensive than the lost electricity they were intended to cover   accordingly the court finds that masspowers refusal to mustrun did not materially and adversely affect mmwec with regard to allegedly more expensive replacement contractsf mmwec was deprived of potential economic gainsmmwecs analysis of mustrun operation showed that at a heat rate of  mustrunning the facility would have resulted in a gain to mmwec of  for the ninemonth retrospective period   masspowers expert jeffrey tranen disputed that gain by pointing to an economic dispatch analysis which showed a gain of about  million over the month period from august  to december    according to tranen that gain showed that masspowers refusal to mustrun saved mmwec moneymmwec contends that any such savings would not have been material in view of the annual total revenues of the six participants   moreover mmwec argues masspowers mustrun analysis assumed inclusion of the capacity bonus factor   “it is utilization of that assumption that makes must run operation appear to be more expensive than economic dispatch would have been”   mmwecs posttrial proposed finding no appendix d to the ppa “adjustment to monthly capacity charge” provides for an adjustment to the monthly capacity charge as defined in the ppa for any month in which the facilitys capacity exceeds eightyfive percent referred to by the parties as the “capacity bonus”   appendix d “establishes the formulae for determining the capacity charge adjustment factor “ccaf” to the monthly capacity charge based on the monthly equivalent availability factor and monthly actual dispatch hours ․ of the facility”   ex   because mmwec was required to pay to masspower a capacity bonus derived in part from “monthly actual dispatch hours” the court interprets appendix d as applying during those periods when the facility was operating under economic dispatch rather than mustrun   accordingly the court agrees with mmwec that masspowers failure to mustrun the facility materially and adversely affected mmwec because it resulted in a loss to mmwec of economic gains ie relief from making capacity bonus payments that would have been significant if relatively modestrulings of lawi  breach of contractas stated above the only issues to be determined after trial on masspowers contract claim are  whether masspowers breach of §  of the ppa “materially and adversely” affected mmwec  and if not  masspowers damages   mmwec has in the several respects found above carried its burden of proving that masspowers breach of §  did materially and adversely affect mmwec and therefore that masspowers breach entitled mmwec to terminate the ppa under §  accordingly masspower has failed to establish its contract claimii breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealingcount ii of masspowers complaint alleges that mmwec breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing   as stated above the issues to be determined are  whether mmwec unfairly or in bad faith exercised its right to demand mustrun and abused the legal process by filing the mmwec action for the purpose of extracting a benefit to which it was not entitledthat is a buyout of the contract at a discounted price  and if so  masspowers damagesthe purpose of the implied covenantis to ensure that neither party interferes with the ability of the other to enjoy the fruits of the contract ․ and that when performing the obligations of the contract the parties “remain faithful to the intended and agreed expectations” of the contract uno restaurants inc v boston kenmore realty corp  mass      a breach occurs when one party violates the reasonable expectations of the other  id however “the scope of the covenant is only as broad as the contract that governs the particular relationship”  ayash v danafarber cancer inst  mass      the covenant does not supply terms that the parties were free to negotiate but did not uno restaurants inc v boston kenmore realty corp supra at  nor does it “create rights and duties not otherwise provided” for in the contract ayash v danafarber cancer inst supra quoting uno restaurants inc v boston kenmore realty corp supra at chokel v genzyme corp  mass    some citations omittedthus one party may not exercise a contractual right for the purpose of depriving another party of a right or benefit which the latter party reasonably expects under the contract   on the other hand because the parties are free to negotiate and agree to terms of their contract the covenant does not create rights and duties not otherwise provided for in the contract   consequently “the duty of good faith and fair dealing concerns the manner of performance” uno restaurants inc at  rather than matters or conduct extraneous to performance   in uno restaurants inc which involved the calculation of a sale price under a right of first refusal the court was “reluctant to conclude that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing has sub silentio provided a specific form of protection that is not mentioned in the parties contract”  id at as noted above in the present case masspower argues that mmwec exercised its right to demand mustrun for the purpose of extracting a benefit to which it was not entitledthat is a buyout of the contract at a discounted price   there is no dispute that the condition precedent to mmwecs exercise of its rightie that the plant had been dispatched “at a capacity factor of less than sixty percent over a two year period” § was established   nor is there any dispute that when negotiating the ppa masspower was free to demand protection from the harmful consequences that might occur should mmwec demand mustrun at a time when mustrun would be economically disadvantageous for masspower   for example masspower could have demanded that the ppa allow mmwec to demand mustrun only when that was economically feasible by some negotiated measuremasspower did none of those things  instead it negotiated what turned out to be a bad deal regarding mustrun   so long as mmwec has satisfied the prerequisite of §  it had the right to demand mustrun  that such a demand might also serve another purpose of mmwecthat is to obtain leverage over masspower in mmwecs effort to force a heavily discounted buyoutdoes not convert mmwecs demand into a breach of the implied covenantwhere masspower could have but did not protect itself from the financial harm a mustrun demand might cause it cannot be heard to complain that it was forced to consider a less unattractive alternativeviewed in that light mmwecs demand was not for a buyout to which it was not entitled under the ppa  rather mmwecs demand was for masspowers performance of a negotiated term of the ppa because that demand was not a rusethe court has found that mmwec fully intended to follow through with having the facility declared mustrunmmwecs demand was made in good faith and constituted fair dealing so far as mmwecs manner of performing §  is concerned masspowers second basis for claiming breach of the implied covenant is that mmwec abused the legal process by filing the mmwec action for the purpose of obtaining a benefit to which it was not entitled under the ppa the court has concluded see below that mmwec abused the legal process  such conduct may also support masspowers claim under c a however because the duty of good faith and fair dealing “concerns the manner of performance” uno restaurants inc at  and because mmwecs filing of its  suit against masspower had nothing to do with the manner of mmwecs performance under the ppa masspower has failed to prove that mmwecs abuse of process constitutes a breach by mmwec of the covenant of good faith and fair dealingiii abuse of process claimthe issues to be determined on masspowers abuse of process claim are  whether mmwec filed its  action for the purpose of disrupting the sale of masspower and thereby gaining leverage in its buyout negotiations with masspower  and if so  masspowers damagesthe court has found that mmwec brought the  action for the following purposes   to pursue colorable claims that masspower was not operating as a baseload facility as required by the ppa and that masspower was not entitled under the ppa unilaterally to sell its longterm fuel contracts  and  to disrupt masspowers announced plans to sell the facility so as to put pressure on masspower to resume buyout negotiations with mmwec and to gain leverage in such negotiations   the court has further found that had the latter purpose not existed mmwec would not have brought its  actionaccordingly the court concludes that masspower has established the liability elements of abuse of process ie that process was used for an ulterior or illegitimate purpose  datacomm interface inc v computerworld inc  mass     however the court has also found that masspower has failed to prove that the costs of defending that litigation exceeded the “steep discount” which partners of masspower enjoyed as a result of the mmwec action   because masspower has failed to prove its damages its abuse of process claim also failsiv violation of gl c athe issues to be determined on masspowers claim under c a are  whether mmwec unfairly or deceptively exercised its right to demand mustrun for the purpose of extracting a benefit to which it was not entitledthat is a buyout of the contract at a discounted price   whether mmwec unfairly or deceptively exercised its right to demand mustrun and filed the mmwec action for the purpose of disrupting the sale of masspower and thereby gaining leverage in its buyout negotiations with masspower  and if so  masspowers damagesthe courts findings above lead it to conclude that mmwec did not unfairly or deceptively exercise its right to demand mustrun for the purpose of extracting a benefit to which it was not entitledon the other hand the court has found that mmwecs motivation in filing its  action was to disrupt masspowers announced plans to sell the facility and thereby to put pressure on masspower to resume buyout negotiations with mmwec and to gain leverage in such negotiations   mmwecs filing of its  action thus constituted not only an abuse of process but also an unfair act under c aas the court has also found however masspower has failed to prove that mmwecs unfair act caused masspower to suffer a financial loss ie that the reduction in its partners purchase price for the facility did not exceed the amount they paid in legal expenses for defense of the  actionwhile masspower has proved no financial harm it has demonstrated that there was “ ‘some adverse effect on it even if it is not quantifiable in dollars” chapman v katz  mass    citation omitted and therefore that masspower is entitled to reasonable attorneys fees under c a that adverse effect is found in the substantial time and attention required by masspower employees to participate in the defense of the mmwec action including participating in depositions and testifying at trialtime that is that they were not spending on the business of masspower   moreover c a §  provides that “if the court finds in any action commenced hereunder that there has been a violation of section two the petitioner shall ․ irrespective of the amount in controversy be awarded reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred in said action”accordingly the court will award masspower its reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred in this action in respect of its prosecution of its c a claimto the extent that the parties
