properties in the cincinnati and dayton ohio metropolitan areas revenue is generated primarily from rental income   note   significant and critical accounting policies and practices   the management of the company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain the company’s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles   basis of presentation – unaudited interim financial information   the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the united states securities and exchange commission “sec” to form q and article  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by us gaap for complete financial statements the unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are in the opinion of management necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year these unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company for the reporting period ended june   and notes thereto contained in the company’s annual report on form k filed with the sec on october     fiscal year end   the company elected june  th as its fiscal year end date upon its formation   use of estimates and assumptions and critical accounting estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that certain reported amounts and disclosures accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates   critical accounting estimates are estimates for which a the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and b the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material the company’s critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements were     i assumption as a going concern management assumes that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business      table of contents     ii fair value of longlived assets  fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value if readily determinable if longlived assets are determined to be recoverable but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated the net book values of the longlived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives the company considers the following to be some examples of important indicators that may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance or losses of assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results ii significant changes in the manner or use of assets or in the company’s overall strategy with respect to the manner or use of the acquired assets or changes in the company’s overall business strategy iii significant negative industry or economic trends iv increased competitive pressures v a significant decline in the company’s stock price for a sustained period of time and vi regulatory changes the company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events         iii valuation allowance for deferred tax assets management assumes that the realization of the company’s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss “nol” carry–forwards for federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly the potential tax benefits of the net loss carryforwards are offset by a full valuation allowance management made this assumption based on a the company has incurred recurring losses b general economic conditions and c its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering among other factors   these significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value   management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources   management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information changes in facts and circumstances historical experience and reasonable assumptions after such evaluations if deemed appropriate those estimates are adjusted accordingly   actual results could differ from those estimates   cash equivalents   for the purpose of the accompanying financial statements all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents   real estate   real estate is recorded at cost expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred depreciation is computed by the straightline method after taking into account their respective estimated residual values over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows       estimated useful life years           building                  land     na     upon sale or retirement the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed

of each balance sheet presented and if not otherwise apparent the terms and manner of settlement   commitment and contingencies   the company follows subtopic  of the fasb accounting standards codification to report accounting for contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the company’s financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses if determinable and material would be disclosed   loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantees would be disclosed   revenue recognition   the company follows paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition the company will recognize revenue when it

under section  of the fasb accounting standards codification deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the current enacted tax rates and laws deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date      table of contents   the company adopted section  of the fasb accounting standards codification “section ” section  addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under section  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement section  also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures   the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets as well as tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards the company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary   management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years if actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary   tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions   the company discloses tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions pursuant to the asc paragraph    earnings per share   earnings per share eps are the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock for convenience the term is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share eps is computed pursuant to section  of the fasb accounting standards codification pursuant to asc paragraphs  through  basic eps shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders the numerator by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding the denominator during the period income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock whether or not paid and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock whether or not earned from income from continuing operations if that amount appears in the income statement and also from net income the computation of diluted eps is similar to the computation of basic eps except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement stock options or warrants   pursuant to asc paragraphs  through  diluted eps shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder the dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants and their equivalents issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted eps by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs  through  and  through  require that another method be applied equivalents of options and warrants include nonvested stock granted to employees stock purchase contracts and partially paid stock subscriptions see paragraph ––– antidilutive contracts such as purchased put options and purchased call options shall be excluded from diluted eps under the treasury stock method a exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period or at time of issuance if later and common shares shall be assumed to be issued b the proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period see paragraphs  and  through  c the incremental shares the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased shall be included in the denominator of the diluted eps computation   there were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the reporting periods ending september   and       table of contents   cash flows reporting   the company adopted

overview   overview   we are engaged in the business of acquiring developing managing and selling residential and commercial incomeproducing properties in the cincinnati and dayton ohio metropolitan areas we generate revenue primarily from rental income from the tenants occupying the properties we acquire and from the proceeds of property sales   since starting our business in march  we have acquired one light industrial facility in dayton ohio   our commercial property was vacant and being renovated through january  in february  we signed a twoyear lease with a third party to occupy this site under the lease the rent escalates for each sixmonth period from  through month   through month   through month  and  through month  there is also a twoyear renewal term at a higher monthly rental rate in october  we attended a board of revision hearing in dayton ohio to reduce the amount of realty taxes payable for the property the property was purchased for  yet the value on the montgomery county property database was  on march   the montgomery county board of pension reassessed the fair market value of the property at  as of january     we intend to expand our acquisitions to other select markets in nearby areas and states that fit our investment criteria as we continue to evaluate new investment opportunities in different markets all of our properties to date have been acquired and improved from available cash   our principal objective is to generate cash flow while gaining price appreciation at the same time through the ownership of our properties we believe the execution of this strategy will allow us to generate immediate and steady cash flow from the rental income from the properties that we acquire while potentially gaining significant appreciation over time after these properties are renovated and in some cases environmentally remediated we expect that the available cash flow generated from the rental income of our properties as well as net proceeds from their sales will allow us to pay the operating and improvement costs of our properties   we intend to seek potential property acquisitions that are located in ohio and nearby states meeting the above criteria   matters that may or are currently affecting our business   the main challenges and trends that could affect or are affecting our financial results include     · a failure by any tenant to make rental payments to us and our ability to renew leases lease vacant space or release space as leases expire because we depend on rental income      table of contents     · a downturn in residential and commercial markets in the geographic areas in which we operate so as to cause our properties to be vacant for long periods of time and         · our ability to raise significant financing to acquire additional properties which we anticipate may be easier as a public company   new accounting pronouncements   there are various updates recently issued most of which represented

business associates to date we have not sought any funding source and have not authorized any person or entity to seek out funding on our behalf if a market for our shares ever develops of which there can be no assurance we may use restricted shares of our common stock to compensate employeesconsultants and independent contractors wherever possible we believe that operations will generate sufficient cash to continue operations for the next  months from the date of this report provided that our costs of being a public company remain equal to or below the maximum estimate provided below   we have embarked upon an effort to become a public company and by doing so have incurred and will continue to incur additional significant expenses for legal accounting and related services by being subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting legal and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements we estimate that these costs will range up to  per year for the next few years and will be higher if our business volume and activity increases but lower during the first year of being public because our overall business volume will be lower and we will not yet be subject to the requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  these obligations will reduce our ability and resources to fund other aspects of our business we aim to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use noncash means of settling obligations and compensate vendors and professionals who provide products and services to us although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of those efforts   there are no current plans to seek private investment we do not have any current plans to raise funds through the sale of securities we hope to be able to use our status as a public company to enable us to use noncash means of settling

that many people have of a public company make it more likely that they will accept restricted securities from a public company as consideration for indebtedness to them than they would from a private company we have not performed any studies of this matter our conclusion is based on our own beliefs issuing shares of our common stock to such persons instead of paying cash to them would increase our chances to expand our business to date we have not identified any obligations that we may seek to settle in this manner nor have we identified any vendors professionals or other creditors that we may approach with this idea having shares of our common stock may also give persons a greater feeling of identity with us which may result in referrals however these actions if successful will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders may further dilute common stock book value and that dilution may be material such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management’s ability to maintain control of our company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management   as part of our plan to augment our financial resources and consider attractive business opportunities our president has entered into discussions with unnamed unaffiliated third parties with respect to a potential merger transaction which could result in

company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates as to new or revised accounting standards   item  quantitative and qualitative analysis about market risk   as a smaller reporting company we elected scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore
