newsletters go solar electric cars solar power  renewable energy rss advertise cleantechnica is the  cleantechfocused news  analysis site in the world subscribe todaythe future is now clean power published on march nd   by scott cooney  top 0 target strategies for solar marketing march nd  by scott cooney  originally published grid freedom electrical contractor dan sullivan felt the temptation of expanding into the solar market in early  seeing it as a way to diversify and significantly expand his business the san diego based sullivan answered the siren song and launched sullivan solar power california is one of the hottest solar markets in the country due to its progressive citizens coupled with fairly consistent statewide incentive packages but marketing solar was no picnic “i had to scrape kick and scream to find my first customer” sullivan said a decade later sullivan’s still in business and still growing but sales are still a struggle even now that his business is an established one with a firm reputation he’s not alone of course but customers are actively seeking solar…so where’s the disconnect “the residential markets are lagging because of a lack of knowledge by the contractors in how to sell the systems” says todd stafford senior director of instrumentation alternative energy and international training center operations for national joint apprenticeship training commitee njatc it’s not the lack of interest from consumers that’s keeping residential solar from going gangbusters he says it’s the contractors’ lack of ability to close the sale so what’s the secret sauce how do you succeed in solar rest easy as the media company behind the world’s biggest clean energy website we’re here to help start by focusing on the customer the first thing to think about regarding marketing whether it’s solar or bouncy balls is the customerany company that begins marketing by talking about how great they are is making a mistake it’s always about the customer not about you what’s in it for them how will they benefit from your product what do you think these customers’ primary pain points were that pushed them to get solar marketers will tell you to tailor your offerings to the customer’s primary “pain points” hunger is a pain point that helps sell food for instance for solar the main pain points are utility bills rising costs of fuel jealousy guilt about emissions and global warming the primary customer point of consideration for many people considering solar is their monthly reminder that they’re paying for every load of laundry they do and for all those lights their kids can’t seem to remember to turn off according to solarcity’s jonathan bass however most people still perceive solar to be expensive even though solar prices have dropped considerably and the long term financial benefits are very clear though i couldn’t find any empirical studies confirming this many in the solar industry have told me from experience that more people seek out solar information within a day or two of receiving their utility bill than at any other time during the month target strategy  commit your advertising to educating the customer about the cost savings inherent in solar if you know when your local utility sends out bills to customers you may wish to target those days with geotargeted webbased advertising or local tv newspaper and radio commercials the secondary customer pain point the rising cost of fuel is notable in that it’s different than the utility bill this pain point is something that occurs to people over time not just at the one time per month they write a check to their utility the difference is that this one builds over time–at some point the calculator in everyone’s heads starts to urge them to think about their long term financial health as more news stories are written about the dwindling supplies of fossil fuels and the rising costs of gasoline people start to understand that the cost of solar which is fixed every month is going to be less in the long run than continuing down this path target strategy  talk to your customers about the long term costs of unstable fuel supplies coal oil natural gas and other  fossil fuels come with a diminishing supply and an increasing demand–an economic double whammy resulting in unending price hikes  your customer’s yard is a chance to let them be proud of going solar and prime advertising space for you the third customer pain point is also one of the  deadly sins jealousy psychology and sociology are ironclad and crystal clear on very very few things but one thing that seems to be a basic human emotion regardless of where when and who is that people want to keep up with the joneses if someone in the neighborhood gets solar it’s a symbol of values selfsufficiency independence and pride it’s a statement it’s a vote of confidence in solar technology but it’s also an eyecatching reminder that your neighbor has taken a step to improve their family’s life…and that you haven’t target strategy  tap into the power of community if you’re on site to do solar in a neighborhood go talk to the neighbors leave flyers ask your customer to refer you to their neighbors put up signs that say you were there and that this person trusted you to put solar on their roof leave no stone unturned in local marketing the last customer pain point is the one that is an important secondary consideration yes people are concerned about global weirdingwarming yes they don’t like the fact that their hardearned money goes to support big oil coal and natural gas companies that have contributed so much pollution and that give so much money to politicians in order to keep renewables down yes they feel guilt that they’re contributing to the destruction of their children’s planet every time they flip on a light switch but according to research published on cost of solar the environmental benefits of solar are a secondary consideration a full  of solar customers wouldn’t have gotten solar if it didn’t pay for itself so  of the market may be primarily interested in environmental and social justice reasons but your primary pain points are clearly the financial side of the equation target strategy  fill your quiver with all the right arrows if you don’t know your customer’s primary interest in solar ask if you’re still not sure or if they’re not giving you a full answer be prepared to lead with the financial savings but to pull out the environmental and social benefits at a moment’s prompting know your industry the only thing more important that making “it” all about the customer is to make sure you know your industry inside and out knowledge of the industry current events what your competition is doing and the options you can present to your customer are critical elements of a successful marketing strategy it’s especially critical if your company does anything other than solar–if you are a general contractor or an electrician that is also offering solar customers may not view you as an expert and may actually harbor some suspicions that you’re a johnny come lately even if you’ve been installing solar for a decade or more target strategy  do your homework and know your industry start by subscribing to cleantechnica’s solar news feed yes we own the site but it is widely recognized as the global leader in clean tech news so subscribing and reading cleantechnica daily will keep you on top of your industry help you be a better communicator to your customers and keep you a step ahead of the competition catch cleantechnica editor zach shahan’s cnbc interview  read up on solar industry facts to make sure you know the answer to many of your customers’ potential questions understand net energy metering and whether it applies in your area by checking out the doe’s website on energy efficiency and renewable energy eere and for pete’s sake know the federal state and local incentives available to your customers inside and out the website for that is dsire usa  differentiation solar seems like a commodity product to many potential customers but there are clearly differences in the quality durability and performance of solar panels i recently had a contractor present me with two options–one for cheaper less productive panels and one for sunpower panels that he called “the rolls royce” of solar panels the difference was clear compared to the other panels that were somewhat cheaper i would have felt like a cheapskate and not a very good economist if i had gone with the others it’s important to note that not all consumers are going to be able to afford the better system but give people the option and those who can afford it will see the clear difference if your competitors are offering just the cheaper panels it’ll be clear to the customer who has their best interest in mind in the long haul target strategy  be able to clearly differentiate your products and services whether that’s your long term service plan or your brilliant track record focus on your strengths and be able to handle questions about the areas in which you’re not so strong   feed your sales funnel many solar companies spend a lot of money on advertising whereas others spend money trying to get referrals revolusun hawaii’s biggest residential solar company gives people  if they refer someone to revolusun who then ends up buying a system this has sprung a network of young gogetters who patrol their neighborhoods and go door to door recruiting for the company according to the company this referral strategy does really well especially in ethnic and closeknit family neighborhoods where outsiders salespeople are often viewed with skepticism target strategy  nurture your customers and other wordofmouth disciples whether those folks are in it to help the planet or in it for their own financial gain or both give them the ammunition they need to help you close your next deal the other major way to get leads is to partner with organizations whose business it is to generate those leads for you our company uses the online solar savings calculator cost of solar for exactly this purpose if you google “cost of solar” our website consistently shows up among the top three results and between that and partnering with cleantechnica and the rest of the important media network we generate thousands of leads per month of people actively looking for information about going solar at their home we give people a free report on solar specific to their lives and homes and then call them to follow up once we verify that they’re for real we send the leads to solar contractors across the country one major thing that sets us apart from other solar lead generators we only give exclusive leads–there’s no bidding war and we’re not selling the lead to more than one contractor target strategy  get in front of interested homeowners–people actively seeking information about putting solar on their roof join gridfreedom today to get a steady flow of leads to local homeowners seeking solar comarket with strategic partners one of the big keys to marketing solar is finding great strategic partners on the surface the best strategic partners you may be able to find are other companies in the “green” field that are already saving people money while saving the planet think energy auditors and organic food cooperatives sure these businesses will have access to a great fairly well off demographic that is sustainability minded and they will have built up a layer of trust that is critical to closing a sale getting a referral from these companies would go a long way to finalizing a deal according to tor valenza solar blogger extraordinaire however some of the best strategic partners may be high on the trust scale and low or less relevant on the sustainability scale think tball leagues and bowling teams sponsor those types of community activities and the general impression of your business will rise substantially within that community there are also likely to be less competitors working that space than working the natural foods coop target strategy  potential customers are everywhere and solar is a large purchase that requires trust build it by making friends where potential customers are…meaning in places you wouldn’t think of first use humor let’s be honest there are a lot of reasons people buy the feelings of goodwill and warmth toward those that make us laugh is unmistakable however and there are plenty of marketing studies showing that these feelings do translate into sales entertain to captivate entertain to build trust target strategy 0 entertain and engage your customer they’ll remember you and appreciate you for brightening their day here’s an example from a solar company

read so farit tells about the reality on how to market and to attract potential customers in all aspectspretty awesome judy caroll great article well i somehow see it difficult to generate leads in a solar company but nevertheless you have presented your ideas well in a way that you want it to be presented keep it up rylan urban i think the ‘focus on customer’ should be emphasized here the solar industry is turning into one where you need to provide real value to consumers in exchange for trust educational marketing is one way to do it – an approach that addresses the concern of the consumer by giving them the information that they need to know this should be a whole point in and of itself something like what solar sell marketing is doing kathy heilmann great article but i don’t see how your illustration titled custom photovoltaic pv systems supports your point about “noname” vs “rollsroyce” pv modules while highend manufacturers like sunpower may be on the leading edge to produce the highest wattage modules there is usually very little difference in the output of the total system because very few residential systems are roofspace constrained one extra module on the roof more than makes up for the difference between the top rating of sunpower vs the top rating of one of the chinese manufacturers who dominate market share today the real issue is longterm will the more cheaply made chinese modules have small manufacturing defects that show up as fasterthanexpected degradation of output and if so will they still be around and willing to stand behind their year warranties that plus a desire to “buy american” is the major reason to go with a higherend more expensive option like sunpower matthew hirsch kathy is right about the difference between sunpower modules and chinese modules module output is not as important as the value of the pv system as a whole and it’s not true that more efficient modules always increase pv system value sometimes they do sometimes they don’t residential installers should take note of marketing in the commercial space and adapt their message for homeowners you don’t have to talk down to homeowners or appeal to the lowest common denominator give solid information to your customers and you’ll get their attention in return plainview zach i follow the residential solar debate and development fairly closely but still could not tell you the “roles royce” or the most bang for the buck panel to consider when are you going to produce a consumer friendly report on the existing panels matt this could at best be a point in time report or maybe a historically this company panels get a  rating since the panels are all still evolving and prices still dropping but a general quality rating would be wonderful i too

endproducts are systems that generate electricity from solar radiation the choice of technology will almost certainly depend on the size of the installation and the annual solar irradiance at the site for photovoltaics nominal power ranges from w powering individual reading lights w to solar farms of up to 0mw olmedialla pv park spain with even bigger sizes in the pipeline larger installations will need tracking in contrast concentrating pv and concentrated solar thermal plants are only viable in clear sunny locations with an annual irradiance of above 0kwhm² due to their increased complexity they are also not economically viable for small installations ssolar thermal power stations can be of utility size with ranges to 0mw value proposition   photovoltaics concentrating pv concentrated solar thermal pollution waste noise no noise no waste products and no pollution fuel consumption no fuel consumption only if used with fossil fuel backup capability operating costs very low as there are no fastmoving parts or fluids low depending on heat transfer fluid annual variance in overall supply the sun provides a stable traffic from year to year with variance ± peak capacity characteristics generally output follows the shortterm fluctuations of the sunlight however thats still less volatile than wind fluctuations better peak capacity characteristics if equipped with thermal storage tank in addition output has smoother shortterm fluctuations due to thermal inertia in heat transfer fluid   who buys solar power generators who where are they how many motivation house owners millions of domesitc roofs and developers  architects of new buildings reduce electricity costs contribute to carbon emission reduction take advantage of other incentives increase value of property councils many councils who own buildings with large roofs  schools admin buildings etc reduce electricity costs comply with carbon emission targets corporations many companies with large roofs reduce electricity costs display corporate social responsibility gain emission credits land owners  project developers   sell electricity sell carbon emission allowances electricity companies big companies often globally operating spread energy mix comply with regulation would otherwise have to buy carbon emission credits in the eu consumer   use solar powered lights or charges instead of oil lamps especially in developing countries or remote areas use solar powered products for novelty value   why would anyone not buy solar the barriers to use of solar electricity are mostly high financing costs upfront perceived to be too intermittent no brand name   risks   photovoltaics concentrated solar thermal technical risk generally low for crystalline pv a bit higher for thin film technologies and concentrated photovoltaics generally high construction low risk high risk operations  maintenance low for fixed panels medium where tracking ie moving parts are used high due to need for tracking environmental may be an issue for some thinfilm technologies same as any combined cycle gas power plant financial may be too small in scale for typical project finance transactions
