the fund’s summary employees aum portfolio values historical f current portfolio holdings new positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund industry – assets under management usd billions rd qtr  rd qtr  nd qtr  st qtr  hedge funds b b b b funds

way to invest in the investment universe a different class of investment are managed futures   commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha managed funds which do are a good way to avoid painful market correction hedge fund news we offer

tix corporation board of directors discloses a nonbinding offer to acquire the company for  per sharecalls on board to create a special committee to evaluate baker street offerexpresses serious concerns about potential conflicts of interest apr    et from baker street capital lp los angeles april   prnewswire  baker street capital lp baker street announced today that it delivered a letter to the independent members of the board of directors of tix corporation otcqx tixc baker street is the largest shareholder of tix corporation with current ownership of approximately  of the shares outstanding  in the letter baker street outlined its view that the board has a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders to evaluate baker streets offer  we feel very strongly that such exploration should be conducted by a special committee of independent directors in a robust and full process to ensure that shareholders receive fair value   the full text of the letter follows dear independent board members as you know baker street capital lp together with its affiliates collectively baker street is the largest shareholder of tix corporation tix or the company owning  shares or approximately  of the companys  outstanding shares of common stock   five days ago we submitted to you a letter the march  letter a copy of which is attached which expressed our deep concern that senior management might be in the process of exploring an acquisition of the company at less than full value  to protect our significant investment in the company and based upon our belief in the companys longterm prospects our letter also included a nonbinding offer subject to certain conditions to acquire all of the shares of common stock of tix not currently owned by baker street for a minimum of  per share the purchase price in cash  the purchase price represented a premium of approximately  over tixs closing price of  on march   the march  letter invited the company to conduct a robust full and fair sales process we believe it is incumbent upon the board to immediately create a special committee of independent directors to explore all strategic alternatives  this step would also reduce concerns arising from the inherent conflict of interest in mitchell francis the companys chairman and ceo exploring a managementled buyout we are adamant that any action which the board endorses must allow for the realization by shareholders of the companys substantial intrinsic value we were very disappointed that the companys response to our nonbinding proposal was to adopt a shareholder rights plan or poison pill without offering any explanation to shareholders and without disclosing either our offer or any actions the company may have taken to assist mr francis in exploring a potential acquisition of the company  the adoption of the shareholder rights plan appears to be but the latest in a series of events undertaken by this board of directors the board to insulate itself from accountability to the companys shareholders it was our strong preference to continue to communicate privately with the company to agree on a course of action in the best interest of all shareholders but we feel compelled that all shareholders should understand the context of our proposal  accordingly we are issuing a press release regarding this letter and the march  letter  we remind you that as board members of a publicly traded delaware corporation it is your fiduciary responsibility to represent the best interests of all shareholders and we urge shareholders not to stand idly by if the board either through inaction cronyism or neglect fails to act in their best interest  as warren buffett said in his  annual letter to shareholders fiduciaries must now decide whether their job is to work for owners or for managers we stand ready to meet with an independent committee of the board to discuss our proposal and the other matters outlined herein very truly yours vadim perelman the march  letter dear independent board members baker street capital management llc together with its affiliates collectively baker street is the largest shareholder of tix corporation tix or the company owning  shares or approximately  of the companys  outstanding shares of common stock we believe that the company is substantially undervalued and that the current market price does not reflect the companys true value we believe the company should immediately commence a tender offer to repurchase shares providing those shareholders interested with liquidity in cash for their equity in the company and for those shareholders who wish to stay for the long term an increased ownership stake in the company we are deeply troubled by indications we have that it may be managements intention to take the company private at a small premium to the current depressed value thereby purchasing the company for less than full value and shortchanging its shareholders any proposed transaction to take the company private by management without the company pursuing a robust and full sales process to all potential purchasers would prevent shareholders from participating in the realization of the companys intrinsic value strong market position and growth prospects  therefore we hereby set forth our desire to participate in any sales process and enter into formal discussions with the companys board of directors the board or an independent committee  further since we have concerns that management may currently be seeking to take the company private we hereby set forth our nonbinding proposal to acquire all of the shares of common stock of tix not currently owned by baker street the transaction for a minimum of  per share the purchase price in cash  the purchase price represents a premium of approximately  over tixs closing price of  on march   we are highly confident that with the combination of our existing ownership in tix and the financing available to us the transaction will be fully financed upon execution of a definitive agreement we would be pleased to meet with you as soon as possible to negotiate the terms of a definitive agreement it is our intention to work with management and following the transaction we expect the companys senior management team would remain in place and to maintain the companys valuable employee base we also anticipate that we will continue to run the business substantially in accordance with the companys current practice with such changes as may be necessary to meet the longterm competitive environment and to realize our business objectives we are prepared to immediately commence our due diligence and believe it can be completed promptly with the companys cooperation  in connection with commencing our due diligence we would be willing to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the company  additionally to the extent our due diligence reveals a higher value for the company we are willing to increase the purchase price however we do have concerns based on previous conversations with management that a confidentiality agreement would require us to enter into an unreasonable standstill to commence due diligence we hope the independent directors would acknowledge that any such provision would be an obstruction designed to favor management and allow a sale of the company to management at a discount   our proposal is conditioned upon satisfactory completion of limited and confirmatory due diligence the waiver of any company antitakeover provisions obtaining all necessary consents and approvals and the execution of a mutually acceptable definitive agreement which would include customary conditions for a transaction of this type and size   this letter should not be construed as a binding obligation on us unless and until a definitive agreement is entered into in a form acceptable to us and we reserve the right to withdraw modify or otherwise change our proposal set forth herein at any time we expect that the board has or will form a special committee of independent directors with respect to managements active and ongoing efforts to take the company private  we look forward to working with the special committee as soon as possible to complete a mutually acceptable transaction that we believe will benefit everyone involved  as the largest shareholder of tix we are committed to ensuring that all shareholders receive full and fair value   we expect to promptly hear back from you in the next few days to discuss how we can proceed constructively  we are providing this letter on a private basis and we hope that discussions regarding the transaction can be accomplished on a private basis  if however the board chooses to disregard its fiduciary obligations and refuses to engage in discussions pursues a transaction with management without a full and fair sales process including all potentially interested financial and strategic parties or otherwise attempts to seek refuge behind defensive corporate roadblocks or machinations we are willing to take our proposal directly to the companys shareholders and reserve our right to take any and all legal action necessary to preserve shareholder value very truly yours vadim perelman about baker street capital lp baker street capital lp is a valuefocused investment fund modeled after the partnerships managed
