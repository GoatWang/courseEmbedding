individual health insurance many health insurance shoppers don’t realize that there are many different types of health insurance but it’s a good thing there are so many options because no one has the exact same health and budget needs as another there are two main kinds of individual health plans managed care and traditional indemnity coverage managed care health insurance this type of health insurance covers medical services from a specific network of doctors hospitals and other health care providers common managed care plans include hmo health maintenance organization plans ppo preferred provider organization plans and pos point of service health plans with managed care plans some policyholders can also open health savings accounts hsa to save money taxfree for medical bills traditional indemnity coverage before managed care plans were created traditional indemnity health insurance was the most common form of coverage this type of health insurance covers medical care based on service rather than health care provider the main difference between these two forms of health insurance is that traditional indemnity plans provide the same coverage regardless of what doctor or hospital you visit while managed care only covers care from particular health care professionals comparing plans from multiple health insurance companies one of the biggest advantages
