all had those days those mornings over the course of our careers when getting out of bed and going to work was the last thing we wanted to do but you did you worked hard for decades and you’ve finally done it you reached the point where you’re ready to retire that first monday when you sleep in as late as you want…there are few moments as glorious this is the point where many retirees face one of the hardest aspects of being retired switching gears mentally from amassing wealth to supporting yourself with it this transition from accumulation to distribution sounds obvious but you might be surprised by how strange it feels you spent your entire adult life earning a paycheck and always adding to your retirement savings your nest egg “the pile” now the pile is as large as it is ever going to be and you need to be strategic about how you spend against it then you realize it your savings are finite now when this finally sinks in unless you own the seahawks like paul allen you might feel butterflies you may find yourself staring at the ceiling at night thinking about the question that all retirees stress over “am i going to outlive my savings” you’re supposed to be enjoying life to the fullest and catching more zs not losing sleep with this uncertainty hanging over you it’s ironic because technically at this point in time you are the richest you ever have been or will be again yet instead of confidence you might feel vulnerable if you do not know how long your nest egg will last madrona has the solution with retirement plan services to fit your situation it is fast painless and most importantly could add years of income to your portfolio as the president and ceo of one of washington’s premier retirement planning firms brian evans has years of experience helping retirees ensure they’ll never outlive their savings it starts with a complimentary financial review where your advisor will get to know you and your story ask about your goals and profile explain some financial retirement planning realities and ultimately help you make some educated decisions by guiding you through factors that affect your financial planning for retirement financial retirement realities with modern medicine you’re going to live a long timelet’s be honest… you aren’t going to spend less in retirementyou can’t afford nearly as much risk as you used to be able tobut thanks to inflation things will certainly get more expensiveyou’re retired which means no more paychecks every other weekyou’ll live with the decisions you make today for the rest of your lifethe income questions what other sources of income do you have like a pension or social securitydo you want to leave something for your family when you’re gonehow soon after retirement will you need to start receiving incomeare you expecting an inheritance at some point in the futureare you done working or are you only partially retiringhow much income will you need on an annual basisdo you have savings tucked away anywhere elsewhen we have questions about our health we wouldn’t hesitate to ask a professional doctor for advice sure we could go it alone but we might not be maximizing our longevity that’s irrational when the alternative was as quick and simple as taking the time to ask the experts in their field for a checkup and a longterm plan the same is true for your financial position in order to make your money last as long as possible and achieve the goal of leaving behind a certain amount for your loved ones you need a financial review and a longterm plan unfortunately some retirees will be hesitant to visit their doctor when they should and as a result are taking unnecessary risks in terms of savings if you want the best shot at being as successful as possible in retirement you need to avoid that hesitation and seek professional financial advice the only thing you have to lose is potential income so do what hundreds of families already have reach out to
