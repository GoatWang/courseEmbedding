developer of submarines teamed up as strategic partners at the recent fort lauderdale international boat show flips where the new  triton submarine was introduced and the brownie’s vs was showcased interest for the unexplored realm of the world below the surface is rapidly growing and these two products present some of the best avenues available for doing so the vs is the new revolutionary all batterypowered surface supplied air diving system that brownie’s has spent three years developing this is the ultimate diving system particularly suited for the family and recreational diving the system vastly surpasses every performance compared with other batterypowered systems on the market and comes at a price point often lower than systems it is often compared to the triton  met its first introduction at the flibs this year image above shows the  triton it has been specially designed to be able to take  passengers in utmost comfort to a depth of just about  feet the special design makes for essentially panoramic view from comfortable sitting position in air conditioned climate at pressure equal to the pressure we have at the surface thus eliminating any need for decompression the submarine comes with easy maneuvering handled with a joy stick and touchscreen controls and its size and dimensions have been specially designed by probably the most experienced submarine team to be able to be usable with private yachts the special design also allows for entry and exit of passengers resting on the surface where as many other designs require the submarine to be hoisted up onto the deck of a vessel an operation that takes a considerable amount of extra time and expense the visitors at the fort lauderdale international boat show showed great interest in both products and several brownie’s vs were sold and several highly interested potential clients signed up for upcoming demonstrations of the triton submarine interested readers should contact robert carmichael  on

yesterday the annual dive industry trade show opened up in las vegas and brownie’s marine group is there with our own booth – booth number  located between the scubapro and the aqualung booths brownies marine groups booth at dema it has been several years since brownie’s marine group attended the tradeshow with a booth but with so many new innovative products in our line this year we felt it would be worth while and get us the chance to show these to dive professionals from all our the world dema is the biggest dive trade only show and it draws dive professionals from all over the world who come to present their products services resorts locations or to source new products for them to sell at home entrance to the  dema tradeshow for dema brownie’s marine group has chosen to showcase particularly the vs third lung which represents such a unique product that utilizes superior technology and offers such advantages to divers as a complement or as an alternative to conventional scuba diving fully battery powered this product is not only much quieter than other hookah dive type products but also green and with its ingenious design and technology it offers real dive performance as exemplified by the many world records brownie’s marine group has set with it in earlier months of this year the vs at dema  draws lots of attention three years in the making this product was no accident but the result of thorough hard work and determination exploring many different avenues of solution in order to find just the right combination that made this product become such an advancement over any previous systems in existence also showcased is the hov package that consists of the super popular contour high definition video camera and the specially made underwater housing for it depth rated to  feet you can bring this camera on most of your dives and return with great video footage for you to enjoy at your leisure at any time later on and to share with your friends and family footage can be shot in quality up to p or you can set quality to lower settings and thereby extend the length of video you can record on your memory card the system comes standard with a gb memory card the hov video package is so compact that bringing it along your dives is no trouble at all in fact the brownie’s marine group dive team with each member having their on camera always brings their cameras on all their dives since we acquired these earlier this summer so pretty much all our the brownie’s marine group videos that we have produced since this summer that you may see on our blog on our facebook pages or on our youtube video channel have been shot with this system our video cameras and their housing before we acquired this were not only analogue but also excessively large bulky heavy and expensive bringing the heavy and certainly not very streamlined equipment on any dive used to be a feat and not something we always care for but with the small and compact solution the system is a thrill to bring along and awards us with fun footage that makes it possible to reexperience the dive later again and again we believe it is only a matter of time before all divers will want to have a video system like this one and we are pleased to have signed an exclusive distribution agreement for the system for the entire usa east of mississippi previously underwater housing systems were extremely expensive but now with a best guaranteed price of only us  that includes the contour video camera and the hov underwater housing this system should be within reach of everybody if you are not at dema you can buy this system directly from our factory or online from our website or via our dealers we will also be showing our very special tooka™ off at the trade show this licensed only product is the perfect solution for resorts all over the world whereby visitors tourists and guests can easily enjoy a dive experience – even if they hold no scuba certification the tooka™ is a specially developed product from brownie’s marine group that we believe will reach a strong interest and showing it off at dema seems to be the perfect place for it if you are a resort operator snorkel boat operator or even an active dive store operator then you may want to check our the tooka™ and the business opportunity it presents if you are attending dema be

highly specialized dive and safety product and triton submarines a leading manufacturer and developer of submarines teamed up as strategic partners at the recent fort lauderdale international boat show flips where the new  triton submarine was introduced and the brownie’s vs was showcased interest for the unexplored realm of the world below the surface is rapidly growing and these two products present some of the best avenues available for doing so the vs is the new revolutionary all batterypowered surface supplied air diving system that brownie’s has spent three years developing this is the ultimate diving system particularly suited for the family and recreational diving the system vastly surpasses every performance compared with other batterypowered systems on the market and comes at a price point often lower than systems it is often compared to the triton  met its first introduction at the flibs this year image above shows the  triton it has been specially designed to be able to take  passengers in utmost comfort to a depth of just about  feet the special design makes for essentially panoramic view from comfortable sitting position in air conditioned climate at pressure equal to the pressure we have at the surface thus eliminating any need for decompression the submarine comes with easy maneuvering handled with a joy stick and touchscreen controls and its size and dimensions have been specially designed by probably the most experienced submarine team to be able to be usable with private yachts the special design also allows for entry and exit of passengers resting on the surface where as many other designs require the submarine to be hoisted up onto the deck of a vessel an operation that takes a considerable amount of extra time and expense the visitors at the fort lauderdale international boat show showed great interest in both products and several brownie’s vs were sold and several highly interested potential clients signed up for upcoming

tagged brownies marine group robert carmichael us scubathe race to the deepest part of the globe is on posted on april    i am getting married in less than a week from now actually my friend and ceo of brownie’s marine group robert carmichael has substituted the typical gaudy bachelor party for me with a real treat much more to my likings so as i am writing these beginning words to this blog post right now we are sitting on the jetblue plane out of fort lauderdale and bound for nassau in the bahamas here we will meet up with the beautiful private yacht called mine games but wait – it gets even better mine games aft with triton submarine mine games holds on its aft deck a triton submarine and right now special invitees are gathering here in the bahamas to try out the submarine and i have been invited to go for a dive in the triton submarine too so in other words i am about to go for my deepest dive yet – to a thousand feet below the surface well that’s the depth rating for this particular submarine but builder triton actually already has another version that has a depth rating tripling that it is a chance of a lifetime so although it is not without some apprehension in my body and mental mindset i am eager to experience it and see with my own eyes what’s down there the apprehension is simply whether this will freak me out – you know like as in claustrophobia i don’t believe that i suffer from claustrophobia but i can get my mind into a spin sometimes and have certainly had my thought during cave dives in particular and hey i saw das boot – several times but when i start to get nervous by the mere thought of being enclosed in a small submarine going deep under the surface and thoughts on chickening out creeps up on me i start saying to myself that fear is only temporary while regret will be forever and it works we arrive at beautiful bahamas after a short  minutes flight and take a taxi to one of the harbors where we are picked up by the mine games tender – a nice  foot intrepid boat with triple  hp yamahas and a short boatride out of the marina to the awaiting mine games resting at anchor about a mile off the shore the cnn reporter having just completed his triton submarine dive on board already are most of the triton guys and also some other guests including cnn who is filming and interviewing yesterday saw visits from fox news and i believe the discovery channel also picked up the story also present sitting at the outdoors table towards the aft of the yacht are a few persons with eyes glued to their laptops updating the websites youtube channels and not least posting and following the twitter of the story as it develops i believe the hashtag for those in the know with twitter is raceinnerspace or racetoinnerspace and no we are not talking about my story of my upcoming wedding and my bachelor party day today ie yesterday being picked up by the news media but the fact that not only do the triton submarine company have submarines for the  feet and  feet range but they are actually aiming for realizing a submarine that will take passengers all the way to the deepest part of any ocean in the world – the mariana trench located in the western north pacific ocean  as you may know the depths here reaches approximately  feet map of the mariana trench so in other words the race in now on as those who follow us on our facebook page may have picked up in one of my recent posts sir richard branson of virgin has set his heart on getting to the deep with his efforts that you can read more about on their virgin oceanic website if you do not already follow us on facebook please visit our page there and click “like it” don walsh and jacques piccard in the bathyscaphe trieste but as mentioned he now has competition from triton submarines who will try to get there first last time and to my knowledge the only time someone ever went there was about  years ago in a tethered submarine called trieste this was in  january rd when jacques piccard and don walsh paid a visit in the bathyscaphe trieste pictured here to the deepest part named the challenger deep named after the british survey ship challenger ii which discovered this deepest location in  getting to  feet and come back alive is no small feat and is underlined by the fact that no such undertaking has taken place since the trieste event in  in fact the depth is deeper than the tallest mountain mount everest is high and actually if you placed mount everest at the same location it would still be covered by over a mile of water but the guys at triton submarines are genuine submariners with years of experience in the highly specialized industry bruce jones who is the ceo of triton submarine has more than  years in and a long history and experience to draw from from his work with us submarines which includes the also work with underwater habitats and resorts flanked also by another submarine veteran patrick lahey as the president of triton submarines who i believe have an even longer experience in submarines triton submarines may just be the ones able to pull off the feat in fact according to triton submarines’s brochure each member of the full time management and staff at the company averages  years of dedicated civil submarine and submersible experience including part time staff the group collectively represents more than  years of experience it is said that less than  of the seafloor has been explored and that even space has been explored to much greater extent so much opportunities may still lie ahead for discoveries and with advances in technology and in submarines we may just see these depths being reached and explored in the foreseeable future meanwhile the submarine dive that i am venturing out on may not go quite to these astronomical depths but will nevertheless be going deeper than any dive i have ever done before and it will come with one extra very noticeable benefit no need for decompression the inside of the submarine is at  ata that is there is only one atmosphere inside the cockpit which is the same pressure that you have on land at sealevel and therefore you will have no need for decompression usually when you dive ie without a submarine then your are exposed to a rising pressure for each increment you dive further towards the depth at  meters ft the pressure is twice of that on the surface when under pressure your body uptakes nitrogen from your breathing gas which for shallow dives may be just air and your body may become supersaturated with it for deeper and longer dives and said nitrogen will need to be released when you exit your dive exiting your dive or simply going from deep to shallower at too great a speed and this nitrogen release becomes too swift and could cause the nitrogen to be released in bubble form which could be really hazardous or even fatal thus under normal scuba diving you would have to exit your dive by going shallower and shallower in a timely fashion which would often entail stopping at certain intervals for a given time we call these stops decompression stops or deco stops for short for very deep dives these stops become unavoidable and time consuming in fact our friends at global underwater explorers who on fairly regular basis are exploring and mapping the wakulla caves near high spring in florida at an average depth of about  feet typically have to endure  hours of decompression time before they can exit the water again and this is just one issue with “conventional” diving other issues include gas mixes managing all the gear you need to bring with you stress factors etc the elements including temperature effects of being in water and so on with the submarine you really have none of these issues you are completely dry in only one atmosphere breathe just about regular air submarines generally speaking utilizes rebreathing systems to ensuring breatheable air and did i mention stress physical and metal stress which in a submarine is reduced or even nonexistent the triton submarine submarine i discovered is just about the friendliest submarine dive experience i could imagine you sit comfortably in the cockpit which is inside a huge acyclic sphere and have great views almost all around you including not least toward the bottom something that is often not the case with many if not most submarines but which is kind of important as this may be exactly what you want to go and look at and study also you can sit and talk with your captain so that you can discuss what you are seeing so anyways all my fears of enclosure and images of implosion or being stuck or whatever came to shame the experience was in one word awesome i will bring you soon more on this matter and not least images for you to enjoy so do come back

companys executive vicepresident and chief operating officer the company was organized under the laws of the state of nevada and effective october   the company reincorporated to the state of florida pursuant to a plan of conversion effective october   the companys diving and marine based products are generally marketed under the brownies third lung brownies tankfill and brownies public safety trade names results of operations for the three months ended march   as compared to the three months ended march   net revenues for the three months ended march   we had net revenues of  as compared to net revenues of  for the three months ended march   an increase of  or  the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in tankfill and nitrox sales to related parties which increased from  to  between the periods sales of our hookah systems and related products to nonrelated parties remained relatively flat between periods this change in sales and customer mix is not believed to be attributable to any particular sales trend or competitive pressures but rather normal fluctuations in market demand cost of net revenues cost of net revenues declined during the first quarter  compared to the first quarter  representing  of total net revenues compared to  for the prior year this decline reflects the companys cost cutting efforts implemented in  including a  reduction in direct factory labor costs and modified raw materials purchasing procedures further reducing direct manufacturing costs due to technical advances we are now purchasing less expensive and high quality and efficient motors furthermore we have also implemented blanket purchase order procedures despite the fact we operating in a seasonal industry we are committing to strategic larger purchase orders which enables us to purchase at a discount while increasing inventory we are also purchasing certain materials from new vendors under better terms the main product categories of our business brownies third lung and brownies tankfill are seasonal in nature the peak season for brownies third lungs products is the second and third quarters of the year the peak season for brownies tankfills products is the fourth and first quarters of the year since the seasons complement one another we are able to shift crosstrained factory and warehouse personnel between the two product categories as needed thus the company is able to avoid the down time normally associated with seasonal business gross profit for the three months ended march   we had a gross profit of  as compared to gross profit of  for the three months ended march   an increase of  this increase resulted from the  increase in total net revenues coupled with the reduction in cost of revenues as described above operating expenses operating expenses remained relatively constant for the three months ended march   compared to the same period of the preceding year selling general and administrative expenses totaled  and  for the three months ending march   and  respectively this nominal decline despite the  increase in net revenues between the periods reflects the results of the companys cost cutting efforts initiated in  other income expense net other income expense net totaled  in expense and  in income for the three months ended march   and  respectively other income expense for the three months ended march   was comprised of  in other income including  in interest income and  in interest expense other income expense for the three months ended march   was comprised transactions that are generally of a nonrecurring nature the three months ended march   included income of  resulting from the settlement of a convertible debenture and associated interest  royalty payments  reflecting an insurance audit adjustment and miscellaneous income amounts totaling  net income for the three months ended march   we had net income of  as compared to net income of  for the three months ended march   it should be noted that the net income for the first three months of  was attributable to the  recognized on the settlement of a convertible note and related accrued interest absent this settlement transaction we would have had a net loss during the first quarter  of  liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had cash and current assets primarily consisting of inventory of  and current liabilities of  or a current ratio of  to  this represents a working capital surplus of  this compares to working capital of  at december   net cash used in operating activities totaled  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively net cash used in operating activities in the first quarter of  included an increase in inventory of  a reduction in customers deposits of  and an increase in accounts receivable of  the decline of  in royalties payablerelated parties reflects the settlement of the  obligation through the issuance of  shares of our restricted common stock in march  which did not require cash these uses of cash were offset in part by a reduction in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  a reduction in accounts receivablerelated parties of  an increase in accounts payable of  and depreciation and amortization of  net cash used in operating activities for the first quarter  primarily reflected the noncash gain on the collection of debt of  being offset by an increase in accounts payable of  a reduction in accounts receivable of  and depreciation and amortization expense recognized of  the condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelvemonth period following the date of these financial statements although we had net income for the years ended december    and  and for the three months ending march   we have otherwise incurred annual losses since  and expect we may have more losses in future periods the company is behind on payments due for matured convertible debentures and certain vendor payables the company is handling delinquencies on a case by case basis however there can be no assurance that cooperation the company has received thus far will continue we currently do not have any product liability insurance and are a defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit and trebor subject to a default judgment in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification product liabilities relating to defective products could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial conditions which could force us to curtail or cease our business operations the company does not expect that existing cash flow will be sufficient to fund presently anticipated operations this raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern during the twelve month period following the date of the financial statements included herein the company will need to raise additional funds and is currently exploring alternative sources of financing we have issued a number of convertible debentures as an interim measure to finance our working capital needs we have historically paid for some legal and consulting services with restricted stock to maximize working capital and intend to continue this practice in the future when possible we have implemented some cost saving measures and will continue to explore more to reduce operating expenses if we fail to raise additional funds when needed or do not have sufficient cash flows from sales we may be required to scale back or cease operations liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty certain business risks the company is subject to various risks which may materially harm its business financial condition and results of operations you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this report before deciding to purchase the companys common stock these are not the only risks and uncertainties that the company faces if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs the companys business financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed in that case the trading price of the companys common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment our ability to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt absent obtaining adequate new debt or equity financing and achieving sufficient sales levels although we had net income of  and  inclusive of  attributable to the cancellation of debt for the three months ending march   and year ended december   respectively we anticipate that losses may occur in the foreseeable future additionally the company has negative cash flows from operations is behind on payments due for matured convertible debentures and certain vendor payables the company is working out all matters of delinquency on a case by case basis however there can be no assurance that cooperation the company has received thus far will continue this raises a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our continued existence is dependent upon generating working capital and obtaining adequate new debt or equity financing because of our historical operational losses we may not have working capital to permit us to remain in business during the twelve month period following the date of the financial statements included herein without improvements in our cash flow from operations or new financing working capital limitations continue to impinge on our daytoday operations thus contributing to continued operating losses the optional conversion features of a series of convertible debentures issued by the company could require the company to issue a substantial number of shares of common stock which will cause dilution to the companys stockholders and a potentially negative effect on our stock price since october   the company has issued convertible debentures to several lenders and other third parties at march   the outstanding principal balance of these debentures was  the debentures convert under various conversion formulas many of which may be at a significant discount to market price of our common stock the conversion of any of the debentures will result in the issuance of a significant number of shares of our common stock which will cause dilution to our existing shareholders furthermore the conversion at a significant discount to the market price of our common stock may have a negative effect on our stock price our common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and may fluctuate significantly our common stock is traded on the overthecounter markets there is a limited public market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will develop as a result this could adversely affect our shareholders ability to sell our common stock in short time periods or possibly at all thinly traded common stock can be more volatile than common stock traded in an active public market our common stock has experienced and is likely to experience in the future significant price and volume fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance in addition we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially our company is a voluntary filer with the securities and exchange commission and in the event that we cease reporting under the exchange act investors would have limited information available to them about the company while we are subject to section d of the exchange act we do not have a class of securities registered under section g of the exchange act to the extent that our duty to file exchange act reports has automatically suspended under section d of the exchange act as a voluntary filer we may elect to cease reporting under the exchange act at such time which would limit the information available to investors and shareholders about the company our common stock is deemed to be penny stock which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares due to suitability requirements our common stock is deemed to be penny stock as that term is defined under the securities exchange act of  penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system our common stock is covered by an sec rule that imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors which are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse brokerdealers dealing in penny stocks are required to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks moreover brokerdealers are required to determine whether an investment in a penny stock is a suitable investment for a prospective investor these requirements may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of potential investors this may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them this could cause our stock price to decline we depend on the services of our chief executive officer our success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of robert m carmichael our president and chief executive officer mr carmichael has been instrumental in securing our existing financing arrangements mr carmichael is primarily responsible for the development of our technology and the design of our products the loss of the services of mr carmichael could materially harm our business because of the cost and time necessary to recruit and train a replacement such a loss would also divert management attention away from operational issues we do not presently maintain a keyman life insurance policy on mr carmichael we require additional personnel and could fail to attract or retain key personnel we are currently utilizing the services of professional consultants in the absence of a chief financial officer and chief operations officer the loss of the services of these consultants prior to our ability to attract and retain a chief financial officer or chief operations officer may have a material adverse effect upon us also there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified associates in the future our failure to obtain intellectual property and enforce protection would have a material adverse effect on our business our success depends in part on our ability and the ability of our patent and trademark licensors entities owned and controlled by robert m carmichael our president and chief executive officer to obtain and defend our intellectual property including patent protection for our products and processes preserve our trade secrets defend and enforce our rights against infringement and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties both in the united states and in other countries despite our efforts to protect our intellectual proprietary rights existing copyright trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection our industry is characterized by frequent intellectual property litigation based on allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights although we are not aware of any intellectual property claims against us we may be a party to litigation in the future we may be unable to manage growth successful implementation of our business strategy requires us to manage our growth growth could place an increasing strain on our management and financial resources if we fail to manage our growth effectively our business financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed and our stock price may decline reliance on vendors and manufacturers we deal with suppliers on an orderby order basis and have no longterm purchase contracts or other contractual assurances of continued supply or pricing in addition we have no longterm contracts with our manufacturing sources and compete with other companies for production facility capacity historically we have purchased enough inventories of products or their substitutes to satisfy demand however unanticipated failure of any manufacturer or supplier to meet our requirements or our inability to build or obtain substitutes could force us to curtail or cease operations dependence on consumer spending the success of the our business depends largely upon a number of factors related to consumer spending including current and future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment business conditions tax rates and interest rates in times of economic uncertainty consumers tend to defer expenditures for discretionary items which affect demand for our products any significant deterioration in overall economic conditions that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income can reduce our sales and adversely affect our financial results the impact of weakening consumer credit markets layoffs corporate restructurings higher fuel prices declines in the value of investments and residential real estate and increases in federal and state taxation can all negatively affect our results there can be no assurance that in this type of environment consumer spending will not decline beyond current levels thereby adversely affecting our growth net sales and profitability or that our business will not be adversely affected by continuing or future downturns in the economy boating industry or dive industry if declines in consumer spending on recreational marine accessories and dive gear are other than temporary we could be forced to curtail operations government regulations may impact us the scuba industry is selfregulating therefore brownies is not subject to government industry specific regulation nevertheless brownies strives to be a leader in promoting safe diving practices within the industry and is at the forefront of selfregulation through responsible diving practices brownies is subject to all regulations applicable to for profit companies as well as all trade and general commerce governmental regulation all required federal and state permits licenses and bonds to operate its facility have been obtained there can be no assurance that our operations will not be subject to more restrictive regulations in the future which could force us to curtail or cease operations bad weather conditions could have an adverse effect on operating results our business is significantly impacted by weather patterns unseasonably cool weather extraordinary amounts of rainfall or unseasonably rough surf may decrease boat use and diving thereby decreasing sales accordingly our results of operations for any prior period may not be indicative of results of any future period investors should not rely on an investment in our stock for the payment of cash dividends we have not paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future investors should not make an investment in our common stock if they require dividend income any return on an investment in our common stock will be as a result of any appreciation if any in our stock price the manufacture and distribution of recreational diving equipment could result in product liability claims and we currently lack product liability insurance we like any other retailer distributor and manufacturer of products that are designed for recreational sporting purposes face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in injury such claims may include among other things that our products are designed andor manufactured improperly or fail to include adequate instructions as to proper use andor side effects if any we do not anticipate obtaining contractual indemnification from partiessupplying raw materials manufacturing our products or marketing our products in any event any such indemnification if obtained will be limited by our terms and as a practical matter to the credit worthiness of the indemnifying party we currently do not have any product liability insurance and are a defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification product liabilities relating to defective products could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial conditions which could force us to curtail or cease our business operations if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately report our financial results as a result current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock our management has previously determined that we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting for a detailed description of these material weaknesses and our remediation efforts and plans see part ii  item a  controls and procedures if the result of our remediation of the identified material weaknesses is not successful or if additional material weaknesses are identified in our internal control over financial reporting our management will be unable to report favorably as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting andor our disclosure controls and procedures and we could be required to further implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation we currently have no independent directors which poses a risk for us from a corporate governance perspective robert carmichael our only executive officer also serves as our only director our director and executive officer is required to make interested party decisions such as the approval of related party transactions his level of his compensation and oversight of our accounting function our director and executive officer also exercise substantial control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the nomination of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions due to our lack of independent directors we have not implemented various corporate governance measures the absence of which may cause stockholders to have more limited protections against transactions implemented by our board of directors conflicts of interest and similar matters stockholders should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions jun   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage this is
