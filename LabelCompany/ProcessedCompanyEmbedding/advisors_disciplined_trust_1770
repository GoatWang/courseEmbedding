please note that the strategy was applied to select the portfolio at a particular time if wef create additional units of the trust after the trusts inception date the trust will purchase the securities originally selected by applying the strategy this is true even if a later application of the strategy would have resulted in the selection of different securities we disregard any stock in the djiasm where the us government or any of its agencies can exercise any veto power over any current or future dividends whether common or preferred to be distributed in connection with such stock in such cases we will automatically select the next highest dividend yielding stock in the djiasm in addition companies which based on publicly available information as of two business days prior to

this can happen for reasons such as these  stock prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time  an issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the level of dividends declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units  the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period  the trust is considered to be concentrated in securities issued by companies in the health care sector negative developments in this sector will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment  the trusts performance might not sufficiently correspond to published hypothetical performance of the trusts investment strategy this can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully invested timing of the trust offering or timing of your investment and trust expenses  we do not actively manage the portfolio except in limited circumstances the trust will hold

trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total units outstanding we often refer to the public offering price of units as the offer price or purchase price the offer price will be effective for all orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange normally  pm eastern time if we receive your order prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or authorized financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and properly transmit the order to us by the time that we designate then you will receive the price computed on the date of receipt if we receive your order after the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange if authorized financial professionals receive your order after that time or

your order is received in a timely manner on that date it is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the orders that they receive to us in a timely manner certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders value of the securities we determine the value of the securities as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that exchange is open we generally determine the value of securities using the last sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange for this purpose the trustee provides us closing prices from a reporting service approved by us in some cases we will price a security based on its fair value after considering appropriate factors relevant to value of the security we will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national securities exchange or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate we determined the initial prices of the securities shown under portfolio in this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus on the

result the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the public offering price per unit varies the transactional sales fee does not include the creation and development fee which is described under expenses the maximum sales fee equals  of the public offering price per unit at the time of purchase you pay the initial sales fee at the time you buy units the initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee percentage maximum of  of the public offering price per unit and the sum of the remaining fixed dollar deferred sales fee and the total fixed dollar creation and development fee the initial sales fee will be approximately  of the public offering price per unit depending on the public offering price per unit the deferred sales fee is fixed

pay any remaining deferred sales fee upon redemption or sale of your units if you purchase units after the last deferred sales fee payment has been assessed the secondary market sales fee is equal to  of the public offering price and does not include deferred payments reducing your sales fee we offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the fee you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert us of any discount when you order units since the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit your trust must charge these fees per unit regardless of any discounts however if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales fee is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee we will credit you the difference between your total sales fee and these fixed dollar fees at the time you buy units large purchases you can reduce your sales fee by increasing the size of your investment if you purchase your fee will be  less than                    or more  we apply these fees as a percent of the public offering price per unit at the time of purchase we also

orders submitted by the same person for units of any of the trusts we sponsor on any single day from any one brokerdealer to qualify for a purchase level you can also include these orders as your own

notice distributions monthly distributions your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment income along with any excess capital on each monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date provided that the total cash held for distribution equals at least  of the trusts net asset value as determined under the trust agreement the record and distribution dates are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus in some cases your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution for example this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose stock is in your portfolio the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends or trust expenses change the issuers in the trusts portfolio make dividend payments at various times during the year when the trust receives dividends from issuers the trustee credits the dividends to the trusts accounts because the trust does not necessarily receive dividends from the underlying issuers at a constant rate throughout the year the trusts income distributions to unitholders will fluctuate from month to month estimated annual distributions the estimated net annual distributions are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus we generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer or adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign issuers or on scheduled income payments however dividend conventions for certain companies andor certain countries differ from those typically used in the united states and in certain instances dividends paid or declared over several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions due to this and various other factors actual income payments received by the trust will most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled income payments the actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary with changes in the trusts fees and expenses in income payments received and with the sale of securities the estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the first year to pay for organization costs the creation and development fee and the deferred sales fee reports the trustee or your financial professional will make available to you a statement  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trusts activity and certain tax information you can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust if available investment risks all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your portfolio you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security even though we supervise your portfolio you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time strategy correlation risk is the risk that the trusts performance will not sufficiently correspond with the hypothetical performance of the trusts investment strategy this can happen for reasons such as  the impracticability of owning each of the strategy stocks with the exact weightings at a given time  strategy performance is based on a calendar year strategy while trusts may be created at various times during the year and generally have  month terms  the trust may not be fully invested at all times and  trust fees and expenses concentration risk is the risk that the value of your trust is more susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular industry because the portfolio concentrates in companies within that industry a portfolio concentrates in an industry when stocks in a particular industry make up  or more of the portfolio the trust invests primarily in stocks of health care companies companies in the health care industry are subject to governmental regulation of their products and services a factor which could have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or services furthermore such companies face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological advances understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th will render their products obsolete the research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for several years such companies may also have persistent losses during a new products transition from development to production and revenue patterns may be erratic in addition healthcare facility operators may be affected by events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other hospitals efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar thirdparty payor programs legislationlitigation from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities no one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the securities liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading in the security is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist

hypothetical performance information the following table compares hypothetical performance information for the strategy employed by the trust and the actual performance of the djiasm in each of the years listed below and as of the most recent month these hypothetical returns should not be used to predict future performance of the trust returns from the trust will differ from the hypothetical strategy returns for several reasons such as  total return figures shown do not reflect commissions paid by the trust on the purchase of securities or taxes you will incur  strategy returns are for calendar years and through the most recent month while trusts begin and end on various dates  the trust has a scheduled term longer than one year  the trust may not be fully invested at all times or equally weighted in all stocks comprising its strategy and  the trust often purchases or sells securities at prices different from the closing prices used in buying and selling units you should note that the trust is not designed to parallel movements in any index and it is not expected that it will do so in fact the trusts strategy underperformed its comparative index in certain years and we

federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor assets of the trust the trust is expected to hold shares of stock in corporations the stocks that are treated as equity for federal income tax purposes it is possible that the trust will also hold other assets including assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those described above in which case you will have federal income tax consequences different from or in addition to those described in this section all of the assets held by the trust constitute the trust assets neither our counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the trust assets and thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal income tax treatment of the trust assets trust status if the trust is at all times operated in accordance with the documents establishing the trust and certain requirements of federal income tax law are met the trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the trust assets and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg dividends and capital gains if any from each trust asset when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the trust assets this is true even if you elect to have your distributions reinvested into additional units in addition the income from trust assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from the trust may also be subject to a new  percent medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax understanding your investment  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if your trust disposes of trust assets you will generally recognize gain or loss if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will also generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in the related trust assets from your share of the total amount received in the transaction you can generally determine your initial tax basis in each trust asset by apportioning the cost of your units including sales charges among the trust assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire your units in certain circumstances however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units for example in the case of certain dividends that exceed a corporations accumulated earnings and profits as discussed below if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  for net capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years and the  rate is reduced to  for net capital gains from most property regardless of when acquired with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code however treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations dividends from stocks certain dividends received with respect to the stocks may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied these special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates generally apply to taxable years beginning before january   dividends received deduction generally a domestic corporation owning units in a trust may be eligible for the dividends received deduction with respect to such unit owners pro rata portion of certain types of dividends received by the trust however a corporation generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends from most foreign corporations inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may request an inkind distribution of trust

trusts created under the name advisors disciplined trust and registered under the investment company act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among advisors asset management inc as sponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trusts inception date the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in the trust and estimated interest distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment additional units of each trust may be issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities or contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts which will generally maintain the existing relationship among the shares of the securities in such trust thus although additional units will be issued each unit will generally continue to represent the same number of shares of each security if the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees the trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the trust portfolio each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement a trust consists of a the securities listed under portfolio in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust b any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and c any cash held in the accounts of the trust neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales fee attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment objective and policies the trust seeks to provide total return through dividend income and capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio consisting of the  stocks with the highest dividend yield chosen from among the  stocks in the dow jones industrial averagesm djiasm as of the trusts selection date there is of course no guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective the prospectus provides additional information regarding the trusts objective and investment strategy the trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase sale or substitution of securities except in special circumstances as provided in the trust agreement thus the assets of a trust will generally remain unchanged under normal circumstances the trust agreement provides that the sponsor may but need not direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention of such securities would be detrimental to the trust if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer for cash if the supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders pursuant to the trust agreement and with limited exceptions the trustee may sell any securities or other properties acquired in exchange for securities such as those acquired in connection with a merger or other transaction if offered such new or exchanged securities or property other than cash trustee shall generally reject the offer however in the event such securities or property are nonetheless acquired by the trust they may be accepted for deposit in a trust and either sold by the trustee or held in a trust pursuant to the direction of the sponsor the trustee may sell securities designated by the supervisor from a trust for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided herein in the prospectus or in the trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security in the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract failed securities the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities replacement securities to make up the original corpus of such trust the replacement securities must be purchased within  days after delivery of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the failed securities the replacement securities must be equity securities of the type selected for the trust and must not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the trust whenever a replacement security is acquired for a trust the trustee shall notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the replacement security and shall on the next monthly distribution date which is more than  days thereafter make a pro rata distribution of the amount if any by which the cost to the trust of the failed security exceeded the cost of the replacement security once all of the securities in a trust are acquired the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust ie the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market variations to improve a unitholders investment if the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs is not utilized to acquire replacement securities in the event of a failed contract the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such failed securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the cash attributable to such failed securities not more than  days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a replacement security in addition unitholders should be aware that at the time of receipt of such cash they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities at a return equal to or in excess of the return which such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of such trust in the event that a replacement security is not acquired by a trust the income for such trust may be reduced to the best of the sponsors knowledge there is no litigation pending as of the trusts inception in respect of any security that might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust at any time after the trusts inception litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with respect to the securities the sponsor is unable to predict whether any such litigation may be instituted or if instituted whether such litigation might have a material adverse effect on the trust the sponsor and the trustee shall not be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security risk factors market risk because the trust invests in stocks you should understand the risks of investing in stocks before purchasing units these risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st of the stocks and therefore units will fall stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements the value of stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies change these perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding government economic policies inflation interest rates economic expansion or contraction political climates and economic or banking crises the value of units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the trust and may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time because the trust is unmanaged the trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments in addition because some trusts hold a relatively small number of stocks you may encounter greater market risk than in a more diversified investment dividends stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not obligations of the company common stockholders have a right to receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company this means that common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a companys board of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders if a company issues additional debt securities or preferred stock the owners of these securities will have a claim against the companys assets before common stockholders if the company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued first as a result the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay dividends on its common stock health care issuers the trust may invest significantly in health care companies healthcare companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotech managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the healthcare field these companies are subject to governmental regulation of their products and services a factor which could have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or services furthermore such companies face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete the research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for several years such companies may also have persistent losses during a new products transition from development to production and revenue patterns may be erratic in addition healthcare facility operators may be affected by events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other hospitals efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar thirdparty payor programs  pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in congress from time to time these proposals span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs national health insurance incentives for competition in the provision of healthcare services tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans the sponsor is unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals if enacted on the issuers of securities in your trust additional deposits the trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of additional securities or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities in such trust and the issuance of a corresponding number of additional units in connection with these deposits existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and other acquisition costs administration of the trust distributions to unitholders income received by a trust is credited by the trustee to the income account for the trust all other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate capital account for the trust the trustee will normally distribute any income received by a trust on each distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record date unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their pro rata share of the available balance of the income account of the trust all distributions will be net of applicable expenses there is no assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends received may be used to pay expenses in addition excess amounts from the capital account of a trust if any will be distributed on each distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the trustee is not required to make a distribution from the income account or the capital account unless the total cash held for distribution equals at least  of the trusts net asset value as determined under the trust agreement proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the capital account and not distributed until the next distribution date applicable to the capital account the trustee shall be required to make a distribution from the capital account if the cash balance on deposit therein available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at least  per unit the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the capital or income accounts but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of such funds the distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially equal to the unitholders pro rata share of the available balance of the income account of the trust after deducting estimated expenses because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the year such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate persons who purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person becomes a record owner a person will become the owner of units and thereby a unitholder of record on the date  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd of settlement provided payment has been received notification to the trustee of the transfer of units is the responsibility of the purchaser but in the normal course of business the selling brokerdealer provides such notice the trustee will periodically deduct from the income account of a trust and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the capital account of a trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trust the trustee also may withdraw from said accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trusts assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts in addition the trustee may withdraw from the income and capital accounts of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemptions of units distribution reinvestment unitholders may reinvest distributions into additional units of their trust without a sales fee your trust will pay any deferred sales fee and creation and development fee per unit regardless of any sales fee discounts however if you are eligible to receive a discount such that the sales fee you must pay is less than the applicable deferred sales fee and creation and development fee you will be credited the difference between your sales fee and the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee at the time you buy your units accordingly if you reinvest distributions into additional units of your trust you will be credited the amount of any remaining deferred sales fee and creation and development fee on such units at the time of reinvestment statements to unitholders with each distribution the trustee will furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of other receipts if any which are being distributed expressed in each case as a dollar amount per unit the accounts of a trust are required to be audited annually at the related trusts expense by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor unless the sponsor determines that such an audit would not be in the best interest of the unitholders of the trust the accountants report will be furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request within a reasonable

portfolio of stocks of companies involved in the health care sector seeking capital appreciation prospectus june   logo as with any investment the securities and exchange commission has not approved aam or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of advisors this prospectus any contrary asset management representation is a criminal offense investment summary investment objective the trust seeks to provide capital appreciation there is no assurance the trust will achieve its objective principal investment strategy the trust seeks to provide capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of common stocks of companies involved in the health care sector eugene e peroni jr selected the trusts portfolio through the application of his proprietary method of technical analysis the peroni method and consideration of investment opportunities under the health care theme in an effort to reduce risks associated with volatile foreign economies securities markets and currencies mr peroni focused on usbased companies including companies with multinational business exposure but also considered ustraded stocks of foreign companies for inclusion in the portfolio companies within the health care sector include companies involved in biotechnology medical devices technology pharmaceuticals surgical supplies and testing activities the peroni method is a bottomup approach to stock selection that is primarily based on technical analysis the methodology examines a stocks price architecture accumulation and distribution trends and relative strength patterns among other more subtle trading characteristics this information is partly gathered and analyzed through hand drawn point and figure charts which have been a part of the methodology for over half a century while the peroni method is primarily focused on the technical characteristics of individual stocks economic monetary geopolitical and sentiment factors at play in the market place are also incorporated to identify leading stocks and sectors technical analysis differs from fundamental analysis which generally involves financial scrutiny of the issuing company and considers such factors as earnings projections pe ratios cash flow and other balance sheet data the peroni method may be an investment alternative to fundamental analysis mr peroni uses the peroni method to select stocks that he believes are best able to provide capital appreciation he believes that technical factors can help identify industry sector relative strength patterns that may play an important role in investment success the methodology allows an unconstrained approach to stock selection spanning all market caps and investment styles ie growth and value additional information regarding mr peronis stock selection using the peroni method is described under understanding your investmentthe peroni method principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in this trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these  security prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time  the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period  an issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the level of dividends declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units  the trust is considered to be concentrated in securities issued by companies in the health care sector negative developments in this sector will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment  the peroni method may not identify stocks that will satisfy the trusts investment objective  the trust may invest in securities of small and midsize companies these securities are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than securities of larger companies small and midsize companies may have limited products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information  wef do not actively manage the portfolio except in limited circumstances the trust will hold and continue to buy shares of the same securities even if their market value declines f aam we and related terms mean advisors asset management inc the trust sponsor unless the context clearly suggests otherwise  investment summary who should invest

of units includes  the net asset value per unit plus  organization costs plus  the sales fee  understanding your investment the net asset value per unit is the value of the securities cash and other assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total units outstanding we often refer to the public offering price of units as the offer price or purchase price the offer price will be effective for all orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange normally  pm eastern time if we receive your order prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or authorized financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and properly transmit the order to us by the time that we designate then you will receive the price computed on the date of receipt if we receive your order after the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange if authorized financial professionals receive your order after that time or if orders are received by such persons and are not transmitted to us by the time that we designate then you will receive the price computed on the date of the next determined offer price provided that your order is received in a timely manner on that date it is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the orders that they receive to us in a timely manner certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders value of the securities we determine the value of the securities as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that exchange is open we generally determine the value of securities using the last sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange for this purpose the trustee provides us closing prices from a reporting service approved by us in some cases we will price a security based on its fair value after considering appropriate factors relevant to value of the security we will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national securities exchange or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate we determined the initial prices of the securities shown under portfolio in this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus on the first day we sell units we will compute the unit price as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission becomes effective if later organization costs during the initial offering period part of the value of the securities represents an amount that will pay the costs of creating your trust these costs include the costs of preparing the registration statement and legal documents federal and state registration fees the initial fees and expenses of the trustee and the initial audit your trust will sell securities to reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or after six months if earlier the value of your units will decline when the trust pays these costs transactional sales fee you pay a fee in connection with purchasing units we refer to this fee as the transactional sales fee the transactional sales fee has both an initial and a deferred component and equals  of the public offering price per unit based on a  public offering price per unit this percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the unit price on the trusts inception date the transactional sales fee equals the difference between the total sales fee and the creation and development fee as a result the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the public offering price per unit varies the transactional sales fee does not understanding your investment  include the creation and development fee which is described under fees and expenses the maximum sales fee equals  of the public offering price per unit at the time of purchase you pay the initial sales fee at the time you buy units the initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee percentage maximum of  of the public offering price per unit and the sum of the remaining fixed dollar deferred sales fee and the total fixed dollar creation and development fee the initial sales fee will be approximately  of the public offering price per unit depending on the public offering price per unit the deferred sales fee is fixed at  per unit your trust pays the deferred sales fee in equal monthly installments as described on page  if you redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the total deferred sales fee you will pay any remaining deferred sales fee upon redemption or sale of your units if you purchase units after the last deferred sales fee payment has been assessed the secondary market sales fee is equal to  of the public offering price and does not include deferred payments ie unitholders who buy in the secondary market after collection of the deferred sales fees are not charged deferred sales fees minimum

difference between your total sales fee and these fixed dollar fees at the time you buy units large purchases you can reduce your sales fee by increasing the size of your investment if you purchase your fee will be  less than                    or more  we apply these fees as a percent of the public offering price per unit at the time of purchase the breakpoints will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirements that only whole units be issued you aggregate initial offering period unit orders submitted by the same person for units of any of the trusts we sponsor on any single day from any one brokerdealer to qualify for a purchase level if you purchase initial offering period units that qualify for

seven days after it receives all necessary documentation this will usually only take three business days the only time the trustee can delay your payment is if the new york stock exchange is closed other than weekends or holidays the securities and exchange commission determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable and for any other period that the securities and exchange commission permits you can request an inkind distribution of the securities underlying your units if you tender at

discuss this option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment goals have changed whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences we may discontinue this option upon sixty days notice distributions distributions your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment income along with any excess capital on each distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the record and distribution dates are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus in some cases your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution for example this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose stock is in your portfolio the trust will also generally make required distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year because it is structured as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends or trust expenses change estimated annual distributions the estimated net annual distributions are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus we generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer or adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign issuers or on scheduled income payments however dividend conventions for certain companies andor certain countries differ from those typically used in the united states and in certain instances dividends paid or declared over several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions due to this and various other factors actual income payments received by the trust will most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled income payments the actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary with changes in the trusts fees and expenses in income payments received and with the sale of securities the estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the first year to pay for organization costs the creation and development fee and the deferred sales fee reports the trustee or your financial professional will make available to you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trusts activity and certain tax information you can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust if available  understanding your investment investment risks all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your portfolio you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security even though we supervise your portfolio you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund dividend payment risk dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time sector concentration risk sector concentration risk is the risk that the value of your trust is more susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular sector because the portfolio concentrates in companies within that sector a portfolio concentrates in a sector when securities in a particular sector make up  or more of the portfolio refer to the principal risks in the investment summary section in this prospectus for sector concentrations the trust invests primarily in securities of health care companies companies in the health care industry are subject to governmental regulation of their products and services a factor which could have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or services furthermore such companies face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete the research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for several years such companies may also have persistent losses during a new products transition from development to production and revenue patterns may be erratic in addition healthcare facility operators may be affected by events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other hospitals efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar thirdparty payor programs understanding your investment  legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in congress from time to time these proposals span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs national health insurance incentives for competition in the provision of healthcare services tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans we are unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals if enacted on the issuers of securities in your trust foreign issuer risk an investment in securities of foreign issuers involves certain risks that are different in some respects from an investment in securities of domestic issuers these include risks associated with future political and economic developments international trade conditions foreign withholding taxes liquidity concerns currency fluctuations volatility restrictions on foreign investments and exchange of securities potential for expropriation of assets confiscatory taxation difficulty in obtaining or enforcing a court judgment potential inability to collect when a company goes bankrupt and economic political or social instability moreover individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy for reasons including differences in growth of gross domestic product rates of inflation capital reinvestment resources selfsufficiency and balance of payments positions there may be less publicly available information about a foreign issuer than is available from a domestic issuer as a result of different accounting auditing and financial reporting standards some foreign markets are less liquid than us markets which could cause securities to be bought at a higher price or sold at a lower price than would be the case in a highly liquid market securities of certain foreign issuers may be denominated or quoted in currencies other than the us dollar foreign issuers also make payments and conduct business in foreign currencies many foreign currencies have fluctuated widely in value against the us dollar for various economic and political reasons changes in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of foreign securities and income payments generally when the us dollar rises in value against a foreign currency a security denominated in that currency loses value because the currency is worth fewer us dollars conversely when the us dollar decreases in value against a foreign currency a security denominated in that currency gains value because the currency is worth more us dollars the us dollar value of income payments on foreign securities will fluctuate similarly with changes in foreign currency values certain foreign securities may be held in the form of american depositary receipts adrs global depositary receipts gdrs or other similar receipts depositary receipts represent receipts for foreign securities deposited with a custodian which may include the trustee of the trust depository receipts may not be denominated in the same currency as the securities into which they may be converted adrs typically trade in the us in us dollars and are registered with the securities and exchange commission gdrs are similar to adrs but gdrs typically trade outside of the us and outside of the country of the issuer in the currency of the country where the gdr trades depositary receipts generally involve most of the same types of risks as foreign securities held directly but typically also involve additional expenses associated with the cost of the custodians services some depositary receipts may experience less liquidity than the underlying securities traded in their home market certain depositary receipts are unsponsored ie issued without the participation or involvement of the issuer of the  understanding your investment underlying security the issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that may be considered material in the us therefore there may be less information available regarding these issuers which can impact the relationship between certain information impacting a security and the market value of the depositary receipts small and midsize companies the trust may invest in securities issued by small and midsize companies the share prices of these companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors common to many such issuers including limited trading volumes products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information legislationlitigation from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities no one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the securities liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading in the security is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any security no fdic guarantee an investment in the trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency how the trust works your trust your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the investment company act of  we created the trust under a trust agreement between advisors asset management inc as depositorsponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee to create your trust we deposited securities with the trustee or contracts to purchase securities along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay for the securities in exchange the trustee delivered units of your trust to us each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust these units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trusts inception date the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units and fractional interest of each unit in the trust will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment changing your portfolio your trust is not a managed fund unlike a managed fund we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed under normal circumstances the trust will invest at least  of its assets in health care companies your trust will generally buy and sell securities  to pay expenses  to issue additional units or redeem units  in limited circumstances to protect the trust  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the trust or  as permitted by the trust agreement when your trust sells securities the composition and diversification of the securities in the understanding your investment  portfolio may be altered if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to unitholders if an offer by the issuer of any of the portfolio securities or any other party is made to issue new securities or to exchange securities for trust portfolio securities the trustee will at the direction of the sponsor vote for or against or accept or reject any offer for new or exchanged securities or property in exchange for a trust portfolio security if any such issuance exchange or substitution occurs regardless of any action or rejection by a trust any securities andor property received will be deposited into the trust and will be promptly sold by the trustee pursuant to the sponsors direction unless the sponsor advises the trustee to keep such securities or property if any contract for the purchase of securities fails the sponsor will refund the cash and sales fee attributable to the failed contract to unitholders on or before the next distribution date unless substantially all of the moneys held to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement the sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which in the opinion of the sponsor would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust in such a case the sponsor may but is not obligated to direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trusts inception date the sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company we will increase the size of your trust as we sell units when we create additional units we will seek to replicate the existing portfolio when your trust buys securities it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees you could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units and the time your trust buys the securities when your trust buys or sells securities we may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that sell units or are affiliated with us your trust or the trustee pursuant to an exemptive order your trust may be able to purchase securities from other trusts that we sponsor when we create additional units your trust may also be able to sell securities to other trusts that we sponsor to satisfy unit redemption pay deferred sales charges or expenses in connection with periodic tax compliance or in connection with the termination of your trust the exemption may enable each trust to eliminate commission costs on these transactions the price for those securities will be the closing price on the sale date on the exchange where the securities are principally traded as certified by us to the trustee amending the trust agreement the sponsor and the trustee can change the trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect your interest as determined by the sponsor and

may create an undue burden on your investment investors owning twothirds of the units in your trust may also vote to terminate the trust early the trustee will liquidate the trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than  of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust if this happens we will refund any sales charge that you paid the trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining securities the trustee will send your final

less than                    or more  we apply these concessions or agency commissions as a percent of the public offering price per unit at the time of the transaction the brokerdealer concession or

units of the trust the brokerdealer concession or agency commission is  of the public offering price per unit no brokerdealer concession or agency commission is paid to brokerdealers investment advisers or other selling firms in connection with unit sales in fee accounts subject to a wrap fee brokerdealers and other firms that sell units of certain unit investment trusts for which aam acts as sponsor are eligible to receive additional compensation for volume sales the sponsor offers two separate volume concession structures for certain trusts that are referred to as volume concession a and volume concession b the trust offered in this prospectus is a volume concession a trust brokerdealers and other firms that sell units of any volume concession a trust are eligible to receive the additional compensation described below such payments will be in addition to the regular concessions paid to firms as set forth in the applicable trusts prospectus the additional concession is based on total initial offering period sales of all volume concession a trusts during a calendar quarter as set forth in the following table initial offering period sales volume during calendar quarter concession  less than    but less than    but less than    but less than    but less than    but less than    but less than    or more  this volume concession will be paid on units of all volume concession a trusts sold in the initial offering period except as described below for a trust to be eligible for this additional volume concession a compensation for calendar quarter sales the trusts prospectus must include disclosure related to this additional volume concession a compensation a trust is not eligible for this additional volume concession a compensation if the prospectus for such trust does not include disclosure related to this additional volume concession a compensation brokerdealer firms will not receive additional compensation unless they sell at least  million of units of volume concession a trusts during a calendar  understanding your investment quarter for example if a firm sells  million of units of volume concession a trusts in the initial offering period during a calendar quarter the firm will not receive any additional compensation with respect to such trusts once a firm reaches a particular breakpoint during a quarter the firm will receive the stated volume concession on all initial offering period sales of volume concession a trusts during the applicable quarter for example if a firm sells  million of units of volume concession a trusts in the initial offering period during a calendar quarter the firm will receive additional compensation of  of  million and if a firm sells  million of units of volume concession a trusts in the initial offering period during a calendar quarter the firm will receive additional compensation of  of  million in addition dealer firms will not receive volume concessions on the sale of units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge however such sales will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints for volume concessions subject to the policies of the related selling firm secondary market sales of all unit trusts are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions we will pay these amounts out of our own assets within a reasonable time following each calendar quarter any sales fee discount is borne by the brokerdealer or selling firm out of the brokerdealer concession or agency commission we reserve the right to change the amount of concessions or agency commissions from time to time we currently provide at our own expense and out of our own profits additional compensation and benefits to brokerdealers who sell units of this trust and our other products this compensation is intended to result in additional sales of our products andor compensate brokerdealers and financial advisors for past sales a number of factors are considered in determining whether to pay these additional amounts such factors may include but are not limited to the level or type of services provided by the intermediary the level or expected level of sales of our products by the intermediary or its agents the placing of our products on a preferred or recommended product list and access to an intermediarys personnel we may make these payments for marketing promotional or related expenses including but not limited to expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors advertising sponsorship of events or seminars obtaining information about the breakdown of unit sales among an intermediarys representatives or offices obtaining shelf space in brokerdealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of our products we make such payments to a substantial majority of intermediaries that sell our products we may also make certain payments to or on behalf of intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the purpose of facilitating unit sales such as the costs of developing or purchasing trading systems to process unit trades payments of such additional compensation described in this paragraph and the volume concessions described above some of which may be characterized as revenue sharing may create an incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend our products including this trust over other products these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units we generally register units for sale in various states in the us we do not register units for sale in any foreign country this prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully we may reject any order for units in whole or in part understanding your investment  we may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices the gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or redeem them we may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to create units the amount of our profit or loss on the initial deposit of securities into the trust is shown in the notes to portfolio taxes this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status your trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if your trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law your trust generally will not pay federal income taxes if your trust invests in a partnership an adverse federal income tax audit of that partnership could result in the trust being required to pay federal income tax or pay a deficiency dividend without having received additional cash distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into three categories ordinary income distributions capital gain dividends and return of capital ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from your trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gain dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gain dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition your trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you a return of capital although not initially taxable to you will result in a reduction in the basis in your units and subsequently result in higher levels of taxable capital gains in the future in addition if the nondividend distribution exceeds your basis in your units you will have longterm or shortterm gain depending upon your holding period the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax  understanding your investment purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year income from your trust may also be subject to a  percent medicare tax this tax generally applies to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from your trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by your trust from certain corporations may be reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  for taxpayers in the  tax bracket  for taxpayers in the    and  tax brackets and  for taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets some portion of your capital gain dividends may be subject to higher maximum marginal stated federal income tax rates some portion of your capital gain dividends may be attributable to the trusts interest in a master limited partnership which may be subject to a maximum marginal stated federal income tax rate of  rather than the rates set forth above in addition capital gain received from assets held for more than one year that is considered unrecaptured section  gain which may be the case for example with some capital gains attributable to equity interests in real estate investment trusts that constitute interests in entities treated as real estate investment trusts for federal income tax purposes is taxed at a maximum stated tax rate of  in the case of capital gain dividends the determination of which portion of the capital gain dividend if any is subject to the  tax rate or the  tax rate will be made based on rules prescribed by the united states treasury capital gains may also be subject to the medicare tax described above net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal understanding your investment  revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment company such as your trust are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by your trust itself distributions with respect to shares in real estate investment trusts are qualifying dividends only in limited circumstances your trust will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of trust securities when you redeem units or when your trust terminates this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the internal revenue service could however assert that a loss could not be currently deducted rollovers and exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal income tax purposes deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income some individuals may also be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions depending on their income foreign tax credit if your trust invests in any foreign securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries you may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes investments in certain foreign corporations if your trust holds an equity interest in any passive foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the trust could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its unitholders your trust will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes your trust may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case your trust would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election your trust might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock  understanding your investment during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax dividends paid by pfics are not treated as qualified dividend income foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from your trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which your trust properly reports as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below however distributions received by a foreign investor from your trust that are properly reported by your trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that your trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met distributions from your trust that are properly reported by the trust as an interestrelated dividend attributable to certain interest income received by the trust or as a shortterm capital gain dividend attributable to certain net shortterm capital gain income received by the trust may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes when received by certain foreign investors provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met in addition distributions in respect of units may be subject to a us withholding tax of  in the case of distributions to i certain nonus financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the us treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the us treasury and ii certain other nonus entities that do not provide certain certifications and information about the entitys us owners dispositions of units by such persons may be subject to such withholding after december   you should also consult your tax advisor with respect to other us tax withholding and reporting requirements expenses your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations the fees and expenses section of the investment

management inc at  base camp road suite  monument colorado  or at  east nd street north building  suite  wichita kansas  or by calling   contents general information  investment policies  risk factors  administration of the trust  may   general information each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created under the name advisors disciplined trust and registered under the investment company act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the initial date of deposit set forth in the prospectus for such trust under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among advisors asset management inc as sponsordepositor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee when a trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust at the close of the new york stock exchange on a trusts initial date of deposit or the first day units are offered to the public the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in a trust and any estimated income distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment additional units of a trust may be issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities or contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by a trust the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts which will generally maintain the existing relationship among the shares of the securities in such trust thus although additional units will be issued each unit will generally continue to represent the approximately same number of shares of each security if the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay any associated brokerage fees neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales charge attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment policies each trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio  the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase sale or substitution of securities except in special circumstances as provided in the applicable trust agreement thus the assets of a trust will generally remain unchanged under normal circumstances each trust agreement provides that the sponsor may direct the trustee to sell liquidate or otherwise dispose of securities in the trust at such price and time and in such manner as shall be determined by the sponsor provided that the supervisor has determined if appropriate that any one or more of the following conditions exist with respect to such securities i that there has been a default in the payment of dividends after declared and when due and payable ii that any action or proceeding has been instituted at law or equity seeking to restrain or enjoin the payment of dividends or that there exists any legal question or impediment affecting such securities or the payment of dividends from the same iii that there has occurred any breach of covenant or warranty in any document relating to the issuer of the securities which would adversely affect either immediately or contingently the payment of dividends on the securities or the general credit standing of the issuer or otherwise impair the sound investment character of such securities iv that there has been a default in the payment of dividends principal of or income or premium if any on any other outstanding obligations of the issuer of such securities v that the price of the security has declined to such an extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor as evidenced in writing to the trustee the retention of such securities would be detrimental to the trust and to the interest of the unitholders vi that all of the securities in the trust will be sold pursuant to termination of the trust vii that such sale is required due to units tendered for redemption viii that there has been a public tender offer made for a security or a merger or acquisition is announced affecting a security and that in the opinion of the supervisor the sale or tender of the security is in the best interest of the unitholders ix if the trust is designed to be a grantor trust for tax purposes that the sale of such securities is required in order to prevent the trust from being deemed an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes x if the trust has elected to be a regulated investment company for tax purposes that such sale is necessary or advisable a to maintain the qualification of the trust as a regulated investment company or b to provide funds to make any distribution for a taxable year in order to avoid imposition of any income or excise taxes on the trust or on undistributed income in the trust xi that as result of the ownership of the security the trust or its unitholders would be a direct or indirect shareholder of a passive foreign investment company as defined in section a of the internal revenue code or xii that such sale is necessary for the trust to comply with such federal andor state securities laws regulations andor regulatory actions and interpretations which may be in effect from time to time the trustee may also sell securities designated by the supervisor from a trust for the purpose of the payment of expenses in the event a security is sold as a direct result of serious adverse credit factors affecting the issuer of such security and a trust is a regulated investment company for tax purposes then the sponsor may if permitted by applicable law but is not obligated to direct the reinvestment of the proceeds of the sale of such security in any other securities which meet the criteria necessary for inclusion in such trust on the initial date of deposit if the trustee is notified at any time of any action to be taken or proposed to be taken by holders of the portfolio securities the trustee will notify the sponsor and will take such action or refrain from taking any action as the sponsor directs and if the sponsor does not within five business days of the giving of such notice direct the trustee to take or refrain from taking any action the trustee will take such reasonable action or refrain from taking any action so that the  securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion with respect to all issues as are shares of such securities that are held by owners other than the trust notwithstanding the foregoing in the event that the trustee shall have been notified at any time of any action to be taken or proposed to be taken by holders of shares of any registered investment company the trustee will thereupon take such reasonable action or refrain from taking any action with respect to the fund shares so that the fund shares are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion with respect to all issues as are shares of such fund shares that are held by owners other than the related trust in the event that an offer by the issuer of any of the securities or any other party is made to issue new securities or to exchange securities for trust portfolio securities the trustee will reject such offer provided that in the case of a trust that is a regulated investment company for tax purposes if an offer by the issuer of any of the securities or any other party is made to issue new securities or to exchange securities for trust portfolio securities the trustee will at the direction of the sponsor vote for or against or accept or reject any offer for new or exchanged securities or property in exchange for a trust portfolio security if any such issuance exchange or substitution occurs regardless of any action or rejection by a trust any securities cash andor property received will be deposited into the trust and will be promptly sold if securities or property by the trustee pursuant to the sponsors direction unless the sponsor advises the trustee to keep such securities cash or property the sponsor may rely on the supervisor in so advising the trustee proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account of the trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided herein in a prospectus or in a trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security in the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract failed securities the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities replacement securities to make up the original corpus of such trust the replacement securities must be securities as originally selected for deposit in a trust or in the case of a trust that is a regulated investment company for tax purposes securities which the sponsor determines to be similar in character as the securities originally selected for deposit in the trust and the purchase of the replacement securities may not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the trust the replacement securities must be purchased within thirty days after the deposit of the failed security whenever a replacement security is acquired for a trust the trustee shall notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the replacement security and shall on the next monthly distribution date which is more than thirty days thereafter make a pro rata distribution of the amount if any by which the cost to the trust  of the failed security exceeded the cost of the replacement security the trustee will not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any purchase made pursuant to or any failure to make any purchase of replacement securities the sponsor will not be liable for any failure to instruct the trustee to purchase any replacement securities nor shall the trustee or sponsor be liable for errors of judgment in connection with failed securities or replacement securities if the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs is not utilized to acquire replacement securities in the event of a failed contract the sponsor will refund the sales charge attributable to such failed securities to all unitholders of the related trust and the trustee will distribute the cash attributable to such failed securities not more than thirty days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a replacement security in addition unitholders should be aware that at the time of receipt of such cash they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities at a return equal to or in excess of the return which such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of a trust in the event that a replacement security is not acquired by a trust the income for such trust may be reduced risk factors an investment in units of a trust andor shares of other registered investment companies funds held by a trust if any may be subject to some or all of the risks described below in addition you should carefully review the objective strategy and risk of the trust as described in the prospectus and consider your ability to assume the risks involved before making an investment in a trust market risk you should understand the risks of investing in securities before purchasing units these risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the securities and therefore units will fall securities are especially susceptible to general stock market movements the value of securities often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies change these perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding government economic policies inflation interest rates economic expansion or contraction political climates and economic or banking crises the value of units of a trust will fluctuate with the value of the securities in the trust and may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units as with any investment no one can guarantee that the performance of a trust will be positive over any period of time because each trust is unmanaged the trustee will not sell securities in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments in addition because some trusts hold a relatively small number of securities you may encounter greater market risk than in a more diversified investment equity securities investments in securities representing equity ownership of a company are exposed to risks associated with the companies issuing the securities the sectors and geographic locations they are involved in and the markets that such securities are traded on among other risks as described in greater detail below  fixed income securities investments in fixed income and similar securities involve certain unique risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk among other things as described in greater detail below dividends stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not obligations of the company common stockholders have a right to receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company this means that common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a companys board of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders if a company issues additional debt securities or preferred stock the owners of these securities will have a claim against the companys assets before common stockholders if the company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued first as a result the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay dividends on its common stock credit risk credit risk is the risk that a borrower is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on a security this could cause the value of an investment to fall and may reduce the level of dividends an investment pays which would reduce income interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the value of fixed income securities and similar securities will fall if interest rates increase bonds and other fixed income securities typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall securities with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading in the security is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any security investment in other investment companies as with other investments investments in other investment companies are subject to market and selection risk in addition when a trust acquires shares of investment companies unitholders bear both their proportionate share of fees and expenses in the trust and indirectly the expenses of the underlying investment companies investment companies expenses are subject to the risk of fluctuation including in response to fluctuation in a funds assets accordingly a funds actual expenses may vary from what is indicated at the time of investment by a trust there are certain regulatory limitations on the ability of a trust to hold other investment companies which may impact the trusts ability to invest in certain funds the weighting of the fund in a trusts portfolio and the trusts ability to issue additional units in the future closedend funds closedend investment companies closedend funds are actively managed investment companies registered under the investment company act of  that invest in various types of securities closedend funds issue shares of common stock that are generally traded on a securities exchange although some closedend fund shares are not listed on a securities exchange closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the closedend funds investment objective and to manage the closedend fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil  and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change if a trust invests in closedend funds you will bear not only your share of the trusts expenses but also the expenses of the underlying funds by investing in the other funds a trust may incur greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the closedend funds the net asset value of closedend fund shares will fluctuate with changes in the value of the underlying securities that the closedend fund owns in addition for various reasons closedend fund shares frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of closedend fund shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors certain closedend funds employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock debt or other borrowings while leverage often serves to increase the yield of a closedend fund this leverage also subjects the closedend fund to increased risks these risks may include the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closedend funds common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises closedend funds governing documents may contain certain antitakeover provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a funds possible conversion to openend status and limiting the ability of other persons to acquire control of a fund in certain circumstances these provisions might also inhibit the ability of stockholders including a trust to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices this characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that a funds net asset value will decrease in particular this characteristic would increase the loss or reduce the return on the sale of those closedend fund shares that were purchased by a trust at a premium in the unlikely event that a closedend fund converts to openend status at a time when its shares are trading at a premium there would be an immediate loss in value to a trust since shares of openend funds trade at net asset value certain closedend funds may have in place or may put in place in the future plans pursuant to which the fund may repurchase its own shares in the marketplace typically these plans are put in place in an attempt by a funds board of directors to reduce a discount on its share price to the extent that such a plan is implemented and shares owned by a trust are repurchased by a fund the trusts position in that fund will be reduced and the cash will be distributed a trust may be prohibited from subscribing to a rights offering for shares of any of the closedend funds in which it invests in the event of a rights offering for additional shares of a fund unitholders should expect that a trust holding shares of the fund will at the completion of the offer own a smaller proportional interest in such fund that would otherwise be the case it is not possible to determine the extent of this dilution in share ownership without knowing what proportion of the shares in a rights offering will be subscribed this may be particularly serious when the subscription price per share for the offer is less than the funds net asset value per share assuming that all rights are exercised and there is no change in the net asset value per share the aggregate net asset value of each shareholders shares of common stock should decrease as a result of the offer if a funds subscription price per share is below that funds net asset value per share at the expiration of the offer shareholders would experience an immediate  dilution of the aggregate net asset value of their shares of common stock as a result of the offer which could be substantial business development companies business development companies bdcs are closedend investment companies that have elected to be treated as business development companies under the investment company act of  bdcs are required to at least  of their investments in eligible assets which include among other things i securities of eligible portfolio companies generally domestic companies that are not investment companies and that cannot have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or have securities that are marginable that are purchased from that company in a private transaction ii securities received by the bdc in connection with its ownership of securities of eligible portfolio companies or iii cash cash items government securities or high quality debt securities maturing one year or less from the time of investment bdcs ability to grow and their overall financial condition is impacted significantly by their ability to raise capital in addition to raising capital through the issuance of common stock bdcs may engage in borrowing this may involve using revolving credit facilities the securitization of loans through separate whollyowned subsidiaries and issuing of debt and preferred securities bdcs are less restricted than other closedend funds as to the amount of debt they can have outstanding generally a bdc may not issue any class of senior security representing an indebtedness unless immediately after such issuance or sale it will have asset coverage of at least  thus for example if a bdc has  million in assets it can borrow up to  million which would result in assets of  million and debt of  million these borrowings also known as leverage magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and accordingly the risks associated with investing in bdc securities while the value of a bdcs assets increases leveraging would cause the net value per share of bdc common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had such bdc not leveraged however if the value of a bdcs assets decreases leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had such bdc not leveraged in addition to decreasing the value of a bdcs common stock it could also adversely impact a bdcs ability to make dividend payments a bdcs credit rating may change over time which could adversely affect their ability to obtain additional credit andor increase the cost of such borrowing agreements governing bdcs credit facilities and related funding and service agreements may contain various covenants that limit the bdcs discretion in operating its business along with other limitations any defaults may restrict the bdcs ability to manage assets securing related assets which may adversely impact the bdcs liquidity and operations bdcs compete with other bdcs along with a large number of investment funds investment banks and other sources of financing to make their investments competitors may have lower costs or access to funding sources that cause bdcs to lose prospective investments if they do not match competitors pricing terms and structure as a result of this competition there is no assurance that a bdc will be able to identify and take advantage of attractive investment opportunities or that they will fully be able to invest available capital bdc investments are frequently not publicly traded and as a result there is uncertainty as to the value and liquidity of those investments bdcs may use independent valuation firms to  value their investments and such valuations may be uncertain be based on estimates andor differ materially from that which would have been used if a ready market for those investments existed the value of a bdc could be adversely affected if its determinations regarding the fair value of investments was materially higher than the value realized upon sale of such investments due to the relative illiquidity of certain bdc investments if a bdc is required to liquidate all or a portion of its portfolio quickly it may realize significantly less than the value at which such investments are recorded further restrictions may exist on the ability to liquidate certain assets to the extent that subsidiaries or related parties have material nonpublic information regarding such assets bdcs may enter into hedging transaction and utilize derivative instruments such as forward contracts options and swaps unanticipated movements and improper correlation of hedging instruments may prevent a bdc from hedging against exposure to risk of loss bdcs are required to make available significant managerial assistance to their portfolio companies significant managerial assistance refers to any arrangement whereby a bdc provides significant guidance and counsel concerning the management operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company examples of such activities include arranging financing managing relationships with financing sources recruiting management personnel and evaluating acquisition and divestiture opportunities bdcs are frequently externally managed by an investment adviser which may also provide this external managerial assistance to portfolio companies such investment advisers liability may be limited under their investment advisory agreement which may lead such investment adviser to act in a riskier manner than it would were it investing for its own account such investment advisers may be entitled to incentive compensation which may cause such adviser to make more speculative and riskier investments than it would if investing for its own account such compensation may be due even in the case of declines to the value of a bdcs investments bdcs may issue options warrants and rights to convert to voting securities to its officers employees and board members any issuance of derivative securities requires the approval of the companys board of directors and authorization by the companys shareholders a bdc may operate a profit sharing plan for its employees subject to certain restrictions bdcs frequently have high expenses which may include but are not limited to the payment of management fees administration expenses taxes interest payable on debt governmental charges independent director fees and expenses valuation expenses and fees payable to third parties relating to or associated with making investments these expenses may fluctuate significantly over time if a bdc fails to maintain its status as a bdc it may be regulated as a closedend fund which would subject such bdc to additional regulatory restrictions and significantly decrease its operating flexibility in addition such failure could trigger an event of default under certain outstanding indebtedness which could have a material adverse impact on its business exchange traded funds exchangetraded funds etfs are typically investment companies registered under the investment company act of  that have obtained exemptive relief from the securities and exchange commission allowing fund shares to trade on a securities exchange shares of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary  market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of etfs may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors etfs are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the etfs investment objective and to manage the etf portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding etfs or their underlying investments change a trust and any underlying etfs have operating expenses if a trust invests in etfs you will bear not only your share of the trusts expenses but also the expenses of the underlying funds by investing in the other funds a trust may incur greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the funds most etfs replicate the composition or returns of a securities index these etfs face index correlation risk which is the risk that the performance of an etf will vary from the actual performance of the funds target index known as tracking error this can happen due to transaction costs market impact corporate actions such as mergers and spinoffs and timing variances some funds use a technique called representative sampling which means that the fund invests in a representative sample of securities in its target index rather than all of the index securities this could increase the risk of tracking error some etfs are openend funds openend funds of this type can be actively managed or passivelymanaged investment companies that are registered under the investment company act of  these openend funds have received orders from the securities and exchange commission exempting them from various provisions of the investment company act of  regular openend funds generally issue redeemable securities that are issued and redeemed at a price based on the funds current net asset value and are not traded on a securities exchange exchangetraded openend funds however issue shares of common stock that are traded on a securities exchange based on negotiated prices rather than the funds current net asset value these funds only issue new shares and redeem outstanding shares in very large blocks often called creation units in exchange for an inkind distribution of the funds portfolio securities due to a variety of cost and administrative factors a trust that invests in etfs will generally buy and sell shares of its underlying openend fund etfs on securities exchanges rather than engaging in transactions in creation units shares of exchangetraded openend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of openend fund shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors some etfs are unit investment trusts uits uits of this type are passivelymanaged investment companies that are registered under the investment company act of  etfs that are uits differ significantly from your trust in certain respects even though the uits that may be held in the trusts portfolio and the trust itself are registered unit investment trusts uits that are etfs have received orders from the securities and exchange commission exempting them from various provisions of the investment company act of  regular uits such as your trust generally issue redeemable securities that are issued and redeemed at a price based on the uits current net asset value and are not traded on a securities exchange etfs that are uits however issue units that are traded on a securities exchange based on negotiated prices rather than the uits current net asset value these uits only issue new shares and redeem  outstanding shares in very large blocks often called creation units in exchange for an inkind distribution of the uits portfolio securities due to a variety of cost and administrative factors a trust that invests in etfs will generally buy and sell shares of its underlying etfs on securities exchanges rather than engaging in transactions in creation units units of exchange traded uits frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of uit units may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors inverse etfs certain etfs may be inverse etfs an inverse etf sometimes referred to as a bear etf or short etf is a special type of index etf that is designed to provide investment results that move in the opposite direction of the daily price movement of the index to which it is benchmarked put another way an inverse etf is designed to go up in value when its benchmark index goes down in value and go down in value when its benchmark index goes up in value inverse etfs can be used to establish a hedge position within an investment portfolio to attempt to protect its value during market declines though inverse etfs may reduce downside risk and volatility in a down market they are not suitable for all investors the value of an inverse investment may tend to increase on a daily basis by the amount of any decrease in the index but the converse is also true that the value of the investment will also tend to decrease on a daily basis by the amount of any increase in the index investing in inverse etfs involves certain risks which may include increased volatility due to the etfs possible use of short sales of securities and derivatives such as options and futures inverse etfs are subject to active trading risks that may increase volatility and impact the etfs ability to achieve their investment objectives the use of leverage by an etf increases the risk to the etf the more an etf invests in leveraged instruments the more the leverage will magnify any gains or losses on those investments most inverse etfs reset daily meaning that they are designed to achieve their stated objectives on a daily basis only and not over any longer time period due to the effect of compounding the performance of these etfs over longer periods of time can differ significantly from the inverse of the performance of the etfs underlying index or benchmark during the same period of time this effect can be magnified in volatile markets inverse etfs typically are not suitable for retail investors who plan to hold them for more than one trading session particularly in volatile markets leveraged etfs certain etfs may be leveraged etfs these etfs seek to match a multiple or multiples of the performance or the inverse of the performance of a benchmark index on a given day and not for greater periods of time this means that the return of a leveraged etf for a period longer than a single day will be the result of each days returns compounded over the period and not the pointtopoint return of the index over the entire time period as a result the use of leverage will very likely cause the performance of such an etf to be either greater than or less than the index performance times the stated multiple in an etfs investment objective investors should recognize that the degree of volatility of the underlying index can have a dramatic effect on an etfs longerterm performance the greater the volatility given a particular index return the greater the downside deviation will be of the etfs longerterm performance from a simple multiple of its indexs longerterm return leveraged etfs use investment techniques that may be considered aggressive including the use of futures contracts  options on futures contracts securities and indexes forward contracts swap agreements and similar instruments leveraged etfs are typically unsuitable for investors who plan to hold them for longer than one trading session particularly in volatile markets nondiversification risk certain funds held by a trust may be classified as nondiversified such funds may be more exposed to the risks associated with and developments affecting an individual issuer industry andor asset class than a fund that invests more widely foreign issuers an investment in securities of nonus issuers involves certain investment risks that are different in some respects from an investment in the securities of domestic issuers these investment risks include future political or governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment or receipt of payment of dividends on the relevant securities the possibility that the financial condition of the issuers of the securities may become impaired or that the general condition of the relevant stock market may worsen both of which would contribute directly to a decrease in the value of foreign securities the limited liquidity and relatively small market capitalization of the relevant securities market expropriation or confiscatory taxation economic uncertainties and foreign currency devaluations and fluctuations in addition for foreign issuers that are not subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  there may be less publicly available information than is available from a domestic issuer in addition foreign issuers are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers the securities of many foreign issuers are less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers in addition fixed brokerage commissions and other transaction costs in foreign securities markets are generally higher than in the united states and there is generally less government supervision and regulation of exchanges brokers and issuers in foreign countries than there is in the united states securities issued by nonus issuers generally pay income in foreign currencies and principally trade in foreign currencies therefore there is a risk that the us dollar value of these securities will vary with fluctuations in the us dollar foreign exchange rates for the various securities there can be no assurance that exchange control regulations might not be adopted in the future which might adversely affect payment to a trust or a fund held by a trust the adoption of exchange control regulations and other legal restrictions could have an adverse impact on the marketability of foreign securities and on the ability to liquidate securities in addition restrictions on the settlement of transactions on either the purchase or sale side or both could cause delays or increase the costs associated with the purchase and sale of the foreign securities and correspondingly could affect the price of trust units investors should be aware that it may not be possible to buy all securities at the same time because of the unavailability of any security and restrictions applicable to a trust relating to the purchase of a security by reason of the federal securities laws or otherwise  foreign securities generally have not been registered under the securities act of  and may not be exempt from the registration requirements of such act sales of nonexempt securities in the united states securities markets are subject to severe restrictions and may not be practicable accordingly sales of these securities will generally be effected only in foreign securities markets investors should realize that the securities might be traded in foreign countries where the securities markets are not as developed or efficient and may not be as liquid as those in the united states the value of securities will be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or absent emerging markets compared to more mature markets some emerging markets may have a low level of regulation enforcement of regulations and monitoring of investors activities those activities may include practices such as trading on material nonpublic information the securities markets of developing countries are not as large as the more established securities markets and have substantially less trading volume resulting in a lack of liquidity and high price volatility there may be a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries as well as a high concentration of investors and financial intermediaries these factors may adversely affect the timing and pricing of the acquisition or disposal of securities in certain emerging markets registrars are not subject to effective government supervision nor are they always independent from issuers the possibility of fraud negligence undue influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists which along with other factors could result in the registration of a shareholding being completely lost investors could suffer loss arising from these registration problems in addition the legal remedies in emerging markets are often more limited than the remedies available in the united states practices pertaining to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than those in developed markets in large part because of the need to use brokers and counterparties who are less well capitalized and custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable as a result brokerage commissions and other fees are generally higher in emerging markets and the procedures and rules governing foreign transactions and custody may involve delays in payment delivery or recovery of money or investments delays in settlement could result in investment opportunities being missed if a trust or a fund held by a trust is unable to acquire or dispose of a security certain foreign investments may also be less liquid and more volatile than us investments which may mean at times that such investments are unable to be sold at desirable prices political and economic structures in emerging markets often change rapidly which may cause instability in adverse social and political circumstances governments have been involved in policies of expropriation confiscatory taxation nationalization intervention in the securities market and trade settlement and imposition of foreign investment restrictions and exchange controls and these could be repeated in the future in addition to withholding taxes on investment income some governments in emerging markets may impose different capital gains taxes on foreign investors foreign investments may also be subject to the risks of seizure by a foreign government and the imposition of restrictions on the exchange or export of foreign currency additionally some governments exercise substantial influence over the private  economic sector and the political and social uncertainties that exist for many developing countries are considerable another risk common to most developing countries is that the economy is heavily export oriented and accordingly is dependent upon international trade the existence of overburdened infrastructures and obsolete financial systems also presents risks in certain countries as do environmental problems certain economies also depend to a large degree upon exports of primary commodities and therefore are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices which in turn may be affected by a variety of factors depositary receipts certain of the securities in a trust may be in depositary receipt form including american depositary receipts adrs or global depositary receipts gdrs depositary receipts represent stock deposited with a custodian in a depositary depositary receipts are issued by a bank or trust company to evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation these instruments may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the securities into which they may be converted depositary receipts may be sponsored or unsponsored in an unsponsored facility the depositary initiates and arranges the facility at the request of market makers and acts as agent for the depositary receipts holder while the company itself is not involved in the transaction in a sponsored facility the issuing company initiates the facility and agrees to pay certain administrative and shareholderrelated expenses sponsored facilities use a single depositary and entail a contractual relationship between the issuer the shareholder and the depositary unsponsored facilities involve several depositaries with no contractual relationship to the company the depositary bank that issues depositary receipts generally charges a fee based on the price of the depositary receipts upon issuance and cancellation of the depositary receipts this fee would be in addition to the brokerage commissions paid upon the acquisition or surrender of the security in addition the depositary bank incurs expenses in connection with the conversion of dividends or other cash distributions paid in local currency into us dollars and such expenses are deducted from the amount of the dividend or distribution paid to holders resulting in a lower payout per underlying shares represented by the depositary receipts than would be the case if the underlying share were held directly certain tax considerations including tax rate differentials and withholding requirements arising from the application of the tax laws of one nation to nationals of another and from certain practices in the depositary receipts market may also exist with respect to certain depositary receipts in varying degrees any or all of these factors may affect the value of the depositary receipts compared with the value of the underlying shares in the local market in addition the rights of holders of depositary receipts may be different than those of holders of the underlying shares and the market for depositary receipts may be less liquid than that for the underlying shares depositary receipts are registered securities pursuant to the securities act of  and may be subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  for the securities that are depositary receipts currency fluctuations will affect the united states dollar equivalent of the local currency price of the underlying domestic share and as a result are likely to affect the value of the depositary receipts and consequently the value of the securities the foreign issuers of securities that are depositary receipts may pay dividends in  foreign currencies which must be converted into dollars most foreign currencies have fluctuated widely in value against the united states dollar for many reasons including supply and demand of the respective currency the soundness of the world economy and the strength of the respective economy as compared to the economies of the united states and other countries therefore for any securities of issuers whether or not they are in depositary receipt form whose earnings are stated in foreign currencies or which pay dividends in foreign currencies or which are traded in foreign currencies there is a risk that their united states dollar value will vary with fluctuations in the united states dollar foreign exchange rates for the relevant currencies currency risk a trust that invests in securities of nonus issuers will be subject to currency risk which is the risk that an increase in the us dollar relative to the nonus currency will reduce returns or portfolio value generally when the us dollar rises in value relative to a nonus currency a trusts investment in securities denominated in that currency will lose value because its currency is worth fewer us dollars on the other hand when the value of the us dollar falls relative to a nonus currency a trusts investments denominated in that currency will tend to increase in value because that currency is worth more us dollars the exchange rates between the us dollar and nonus currencies depend upon such factors as supply and demand in the currency exchange markets international balance of payments governmental intervention speculation and other economic and political conditions a trust may incur conversion costs when it converts its holdings to another currency nonus exchange dealers may realize a profit on the difference between the price at which a trust buys and sells currencies a trust may engage in nonus currency exchange transactions in connection with its portfolio investments a trust may also be subject to currency risk through investments in adrs gdrs and other nonus securities denominated in us dollars foreign government securities risk the ability of a government issuer especially in an emerging market country to make timely and complete payments on its debt obligations will be strongly influenced by the government issuers balance of payments including export performance its access to international credits and investments fluctuations of interest rates and the extent of its foreign reserves a country whose exports are concentrated in a few commodities or whose economy depends on certain strategic imports could be vulnerable to fluctuations in international prices of these commodities or imports if a government issuer cannot generate sufficient earnings from foreign trade to service its external debt it may need to depend on continuing loans and aid from foreign governments commercial banks and multinational organizations there are no bankruptcy proceedings similar to those in the united states by which defaulted government debt may be collected additional factors that may influence a government issuers ability or willingness to service debt include but are not limited to a countrys cash flow situation the ability of sufficient foreign exchange on the date a payment is due where applicable the relative size of its debt burden to the economy as a whole and the issuers policy towards the international monetary fund the international bank for reconstruction and development and other international agencies to which a government debtor may be subject supranational entities securities certain securities are obligations issued by supranational entities such as the international bank for reconstruction and development the world bank the government members or stockholders usually make initial capital  contributions to supranational entities and in many cases are committed to make additional capital contributions if a supranational entity is unable to repay its borrowings there is no guarantee that one or more stockholders of a supranational entity will continue to make any necessary additional capital contributions if such contributions are not made the entity may be unable to pay interest or repay principal on its debt securities and an investor in such securities may lose money on such investments smallcap and midcap companies smaller company stocks customarily involve more investment risk than larger company stocks smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources may lack management depth or experience and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments than large companies some of these companies may distribute sell or produce products which have recently been brought to market and may be dependent on key personnel the prices of small or midsize company securities are often more volatile than prices associated with large company issues and can display abrupt or erratic movements at times due to limited trading volumes and less publicly available information also because smallcap and midcap companies normally have fewer shares outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large companies it may be more difficult for a trust which contains these securities to buy and sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices real estate investment trusts many factors can have an adverse impact on the performance of a particular real estate investment trust or other real estaterelated investments a reit including its cash available for distribution the credit quality of a particular reit or the real estate industry generally the success of reits depends on various factors including the occupancy and rent levels appreciation of the underlying property and the ability to raise rents on those properties economic recession overbuilding tax law changes higher interest rates or excessive speculation can all negatively impact reits their future earnings and share prices reits are subject to risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate which include among other factors general us and global as well as local economic conditions decline in real estate values the financial health of tenants overbuilding and increased competition for tenants oversupply of properties for sale changing demographics changes in interest rates tax rates and other operating expenses changes in government regulations changes in zoning laws the ability of the owner to provide adequate management maintenance and insurance faulty construction and the ongoing need for capital improvements the cost of complying with the americans with disabilities act regulatory and judicial requirements including relating to liability for environmental hazards natural or manmade disasters changes in the perception of prospective tenants of the safety convenience and attractiveness of the properties changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand and the unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at rates acceptable to developers variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate generally and reits in particular  properties owned by a reit may not be adequately insured against certain losses and may be subject to significant environmental liabilities including remediation costs you should also be aware that reits may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects the real estate industry may be cyclical and if a trust or a fund held by a trust acquires reit securities at or near the top of the cycle there is increased risk of a decline in value of the reit securities and therefore the value of the units reits are also subject to defaults by borrowers and the markets perception of the reit industry generally because of their structure and the legal requirement that they distribute a certain percentage of their taxable income to shareholders annually reits require frequent amounts of new funding through both borrowing money and issuing stock thus reits historically have frequently issued substantial amounts of new equity shares or equivalents to purchase or build new properties this may have adversely affected reit equity share market prices both existing and new share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices in the future especially when reits continue to issue stock when real estate prices are relatively high and stock prices are relatively low the value of reits and other realestate related investments may also be affected by downturns in the housing and mortgage lending markets in the past government authorities have engaged in administrative and legislative action intended to address both short and longterm difficulties facing the housing and mortgage lending markets and the broader economy no one can predict the action that might be taken or the effect any action or inaction will have and it is possible that any actions taken by government authorities will not address or help improve the state of such difficulties as intended downturns in the housing market and corresponding government action may have far reaching consequences into many geographic regions and consequently the value of securities may decline in response to such developments master limited partnerships master limited partnerships mlps are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are generally taxed as partnerships whose interests are traded on securities exchanges mlp ownership generally consists of a general partner and limited partners the general partner manages the partnership has an ownership stake in the partnership and is eligible to receive an incentive distribution the limited partners provide capital to the partnership have a limited if any role in the operation and management of the partnership and receive cash distributions most mlps generally operate in the energy natural resources or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in those sectors mlps are also subject to the risk that authorities could challenge the tax treatment of mlps for federal income tax purposes which could have a negative impact on the aftertax income available for distribution by the mlps bond quality risk bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases or withdraws the bonds rating prepayment risk when interest rates fall among other factors the issuer of a fixed income security may prepay its obligations earlier than expected such amounts will result in early distributions to an investor who may be unable to reinvest such amounts at the yields  originally invested which could adversely impact the value of your investment certain bonds include call provisions which expose such an investor to call risk call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates in general fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond the holder of such bond will receive principal but will not receive any future interest distributions on the bond such investor might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value certain bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events extension risk when interest rates rise among other factors issuers of a security may pay off obligations more slowly than expected causing the value of such obligations to fall when issued and delayed delivery bonds certain debt obligations may have been purchased on a when as and if issued or delayed delivery basis the delivery of any such bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of investors on their respective dates of delivery investors will be at risk with respect to all when as and if issued and delayed delivery bonds ie may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the values of such bonds from the date they purchase their investment premium securities certain securities may have been acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the premium securities at the time they were purchased by the fund were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued securities of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable securities decrease the market premium of previously issued securities will be increased and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities increase the market premium of previously issued securities will be reduced other things being equal the current returns of securities trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable securities of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium securities tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium security at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the redeemed securities have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount securities a premium over the accreted value market discount certain fixed income securities may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on discount securities at the time of purchase are lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued securities of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities increase the market discount of previously issued securities will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities decline the market discount of previously issued securities will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the  value of securities purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than securities purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of securities purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than securities purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount securities will be reduced original issue discount bonds original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value under current law the original issue discount which is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the bonds is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxable interest income for us federal income tax purposes zero coupon bonds certain bonds may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest restricted securities certain securities may only be resold pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  the securities act such securities may not be readily marketable restricted securities may be sold only to purchasers meeting certain eligibility requirements in privately negotiated transactions or in a public offering with respect to which a registration statement is in effect under the securities act where registration of such securities under the securities act is required an owner may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a considerable period may elapse between the time of the decision to sell and the time an owner may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement if during such a period adverse market conditions were to develop an owner might obtain a less favorable price than that which prevailed when it decided to sell preferred stock risks preferred stocks may be susceptible to general stock market movements and to volatile increases and decreases of value as market confidence in and perceptions of the issuers change these perceptions are based on unpredictable factors including expectations regarding government economic monetary and fiscal policies inflation and interest rates economic expansion or contraction market liquidity and global or regional  political economic or banking crises preferred stocks are also vulnerable to congressional reductions in the dividendsreceived deduction which would adversely affect the aftertax return to the investors who can take advantage of the deduction such a reduction might adversely affect the value of preferred stocks in general holders of preferred stocks as owners of the entity have rights to receive payments from the issuers of those preferred stocks that are generally subordinate to those of creditors of or holders of debt obligations or in some cases other senior preferred stocks of such issuers preferred stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and therefore do not offer any assurance of income or provide the same degree of protection of capital as do debt securities the issuance of additional debt securities or senior preferred stocks will create prior claims for payment of principal and interest and senior dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its preferred stock or the rights of holders of preferred stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy the value of preferred stocks is subject to market fluctuations for as long as the preferred stocks remain outstanding and thus the value of the securities may be expected to fluctuate over the life of a trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing on the trusts initial date of deposit trust preferred securities risks holders of trust preferred securities incur risks in addition to or slightly different than the typical risks of holding preferred stocks trust preferred securities are limitedlife preferred securities that are typically issued by corporations generally in the form of interestbearing notes or preferred securities issued by corporations or by an affiliated business trust of a corporation generally in the form of beneficial interests in subordinated debentures issued by the corporation or similarly structured securities the maturity and dividend rate of the trust preferred securities are structured to match the maturity and coupon interest rate of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures trust preferred securities usually mature on the stated maturity date of the interest bearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures and may be redeemed or liquidated prior to the stated maturity date of such instruments for any reason on or after their stated call date or upon the occurrence of certain circumstances at any time trust preferred securities generally have a yield advantage over traditional preferred stocks but unlike preferred stocks distributions on the trust preferred securities are generally treated as interest rather than dividends for federal income tax purposes unlike most preferred stocks distributions received from trust preferred securities are generally not eligible for the dividends received deduction certain of the risks unique to trust preferred securities include i distributions on trust preferred securities will be made only if interest payments on the interest bearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures are made ii a corporation issuing the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures may defer interest payments on these instruments for up to  consecutive quarters and if such election is made distributions will not be made on the trust preferred securities during the deferral period iii certain tax or regulatory events may trigger the redemption of the interest bearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures by the issuing corporation and result in prepayment of the trust preferred securities prior to their stated maturity date iv future legislation may be proposed or enacted that may prohibit the corporation from deducting its interest payments on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures for tax purposes making redemption of these instruments likely v a corporation may redeem the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after a stated call  date vi trust preferred securities holders have very limited voting rights and vii payment of interest on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on the trust preferred securities is dependent on the financial condition of the issuing corporation highyield securities highyield or junk securities the generic names for securities rated below bbb by standard  poors or below baa by moodys or similar ratings of other rating agencies are frequently issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development by established companies whose operations or industries are depressed or by highly leveraged companies purchased in leveraged buyout transactions these obligations that are considered below investment grade and should be considered speculative as such ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade the market for high yield securities is very specialized and investors in it have been predominantly financial institutions highyield securities are generally not listed on a national securities exchange trading of highyield securities therefore takes place primarily in overthecounter markets that consist of groups of dealer firms that are typically major securities firms because the highyield security market is a dealer market rather than an auction market no single obtainable price for a given security prevails at any given time prices are determined by negotiation between traders the existence of a liquid trading market for the securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the securities there can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the securities that any market for the securities will be maintained or of the liquidity of the securities in any markets made not all dealers maintain markets in all highyield securities therefore since there are fewer traders in these securities than there are in investment grade securities the bid offer spread is usually greater for highyield securities than it is for investment grade securities the price at which the securities may be sold to meet redemptions and the value of a trust may be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or absent an investment in highyield highrisk debt obligations or junk obligations may include increased credit risks and the risk that the value of the units will decline and may decline precipitously with increases in interest rates during certain periods there have been wide fluctuations in interest rates and thus in the value of debt obligations generally certain highyield securities may be subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss of income and principal than are investments in loweryielding higher rated securities and their value may decline precipitously because of increases in interest rates not only because the increases in rates generally decrease values but also because increased rates may indicate a slowdown in the economy and a decrease in the value of assets generally that may adversely affect the credit of issuers of highyield highrisk securities resulting in a higher incidence of defaults among highyield highrisk securities a slowdown in the economy or a development adversely affecting an issuers creditworthiness may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings or sell assets at the rate and at the prices respectively that are required to produce sufficient cash flow to meet its interest and principal requirements for an issuer that has outstanding both senior commercial bank debt and subordinated highyield highrisk securities an increase in interest rates will increase that issuers interest expense insofar as the interest rate on the bank debt is fluctuating however many leveraged issuers enter into interest rate protection agreements to fix or cap the interest rate on a large portion of their bank debt this reduces exposure to increasing rates but reduces the benefit to the issuer of declining rates the sponsor cannot predict future economic  policies or their consequences or therefore the course or extent of any similar market fluctuations in the future lowerrated securities tend to offer higher yields than higherrated securities with the same maturities because the creditworthiness of the issuers of lowerrated securities may not be as strong as that of other issuers moreover if a security is recharacterized as equity by the internal revenue service for federal income tax purposes the issuers interest deduction with respect to the security will be disallowed and this disallowance may adversely affect the issuers credit rating because investors generally perceive that there are greater risks associated with the lowerrated securities the yields and prices of these securities tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities with changes in the perceived quality of the credit of their issuers in addition the market value of highyield highrisk securities may fluctuate more than the market value of higherrated securities since these securities tend to reflect shortterm credit development to a greater extent than higher rated securities lowerrated securities generally involve greater risks of loss of income and principal than higherrated securities issuers of lower rated securities may possess fewer creditworthiness characteristics than issuers of higherrated securities and especially in the case of issuers whose obligations or credit standing have recently been downgraded may be subject to claims by debtholders owners of property leased to the issuer or others which if sustained would make it more difficult for the issuers to meet their payment obligations highyield highrisk securities are also affected by variables such as interest rates inflation rates and real growth in the economy should the issuer of any security default in the payment of principal or interest the holders of such security may incur additional expenses seeking payment on the defaulted security because the amounts if any recovered in payment under the defaulted security may not be reflected in the value of a fund held by a trust or units of a trust until actually received and depending upon when a unitholder purchases or sells his or her units it is possible that a unitholder would bear a portion of the cost of recovery without receiving any portion of the payment recovered highyield highrisk securities are generally subordinated obligations the payment of principal and premium if any interest and sinking fund requirements with respect to subordinated obligations of an issuer is subordinated in right of payment to the payment of senior obligations of the issuer senior obligations generally include most if not all significant debt obligations of an issuer whether existing at the time of issuance of subordinated debt or created thereafter upon any distribution of the assets of an issuer with subordinated obligations upon dissolution total or partial liquidation or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the issuer the holders of senior indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in full before holders of subordinated indebtedness will be entitled to receive any payment moreover generally no payment with respect to subordinated indebtedness may be made while there exists a default with respect to any senior indebtedness thus in the event of insolvency holders of senior indebtedness of an issuer generally will recover more ratably than holders of subordinated indebtedness of that issuer municipal bonds certain municipals bonds are general obligation bonds and are general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity  other municipals bonds are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors certain municipal bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from mortgage loans certain of such housing bonds may be fha insured or may be single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds these bonds were issued under provisions of the internal revenue code which include certain requirements relating to the use of the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its taxexempt status in each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations certain issuers of housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds certain municipal bonds may be health care revenue bonds ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other health care facilities efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance the funding of medicare medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs government regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs certain municipal bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas general problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary period the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental  considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain bonds to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds certain municipal bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances certain municipal bonds may be industrial revenue bonds irbs irbs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers in some cases a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected certain municipal bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity lease obligations lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation although the lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for which the municipalitys taxing power is pledged a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipalitys covenant to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation however certain lease obligations contain non appropriation clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby although nonappropriation lease  obligations are secured by the leased property disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove difficult certain municipal bonds may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds general problems relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers certain municipal bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements from time to time the air transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints and other factors and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents certain municipal bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities no one can predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds prior to the stated maturity of the bonds  certain municipal bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity a taxexempt municipal bond purchased at a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates certain municipal bonds may be subject to redemption prior to their stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions call provisions or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise a sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for retirement of debt a callable debt obligation is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer a refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed at or before maturity by the proceeds of a new debt obligation in general call provisions are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium over par than when it is at a discount from par the exercise of redemption or call provisions will except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit redemptions result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions extraordinary optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of certain events generally events that may permit the extraordinary optional redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include among others a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used an exercise by a local state or federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic changes in law or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of the agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to finance the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes excessive liabilities such as taxes not imposed on the date the bonds are issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds an administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the bonds an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to redeem bonds or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the bonds resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds the issuer of certain bonds may have sold or reserved the right to sell upon the satisfaction of certain conditions to third parties all or any portion of its rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions of such bonds in such a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third party a third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold such rights no one can predict all of the circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds see also the discussion of single family mortgage and multifamily revenue bonds above for more information on the call provisions of such bonds  convertible securities convertible securities are generally debt obligations or preferred stock of a company that are convertible into another security of the company typically common stock convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than nonconvertible fixed income securities of similar credit quality because of the potential for capital appreciation the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline however a convertible securitys market value also tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company particularly when the stock price is greater than the convertible securitys conversion price the conversion price is defined as the predetermined price or exchange ratio at which the convertible security can be converted or exchanged for the underlying common stock as the market price of the underlying common stock declines below the conversion price the price of the convertible security tends to be increasingly influenced more by the yield of the convertible security than by the market price of the underlying common stock thus it may not decline in price to the same extent as the underlying common stock and convertible securities generally have less potential for gain or loss than common stocks however mandatory convertible securities as discussed below generally do not limit the potential for loss to the same extent as securities convertible at the option of the holder in the event of a liquidation of the issuing company holders of convertible securities would be paid before that companys common stockholders consequently an issuers convertible securities generally entail less risk than its common stock however convertible securities generally fall below other debt obligations of the same issuer in order of preference or priority in the event of a liquidation and are typically unrated or rated lower than such debt obligations in addition contingent payment convertible securities allow the issuer to claim deductions based on its nonconvertible cost of debt which generally will result in deduction in excess of the actual cash payments made on the securities and accordingly holders will recognize income in amounts in excess of the cash payments received mandatory convertible securities are distinguished as a subset of convertible securities because the conversion is not optional and the conversion price at maturity is based solely upon the market price of the underlying common stock which may be significantly less than par or the price above or below par paid for these reasons the risks associated with investing in mandatory convertible securities most closely resemble the risks inherent in common stocks mandatory convertible securities customarily pay a higher coupon yield to compensate for the potential risk of additional price volatility and loss upon conversion because the market price of a mandatory convertible security increasingly corresponds to the market price of its underlying common stock as the convertible security approaches its conversion date there can be no assurance that the higher coupon will compensate for the potential loss senior loans senior loans may be issued by banks other financial institutions and other investors to corporations partnerships limited liability companies and other entities to finance leveraged buyouts recapitalizations mergers acquisitions stock repurchases debt refinancings and to a lesser extent for general operating and other purposes senior loans generally are of below investment grade credit quality and may be unrated at the time of investment they generally are not registered with the securities and exchange commission or any state securities commission and generally are not listed on any securities exchange  an investment in senior loans involves risk that the borrowers under senior loans may default on their obligations to pay principal or interest when due although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral would satisfy the borrowers obligation in the event of nonpayment or that such collateral could be readily liquidated senior loans are typically structured as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes as a result the yield on an investment in senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment the amount of public information available on senior loans generally will be less extensive than that available for other types of assets no reliable active trading market currently exists for many senior loans although a secondary market for certain senior loans does exist senior loans are thus relatively illiquid if a fund held by a trust invests in senior loans liquidity of a senior loan refers to the ability of the fund to sell the investment in a timely manner at a price approximately equal to its value on the funds books the illiquidity of senior loans may impair a funds ability to realized the full value of its assets in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation of such assets because of the lack of an active trading market illiquid securities are also difficult to value and prices provided by external pricing services may not reflect the true value of the securities however many senior loans are of a large principal amount and are held by financial institutions to the extent that a secondary market does exist for certain senior loans the market may be subject to irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods the market for senior loans could be disrupted in the event of an economic downturn or a substantial increase or decrease in interest rates this could result in increased volatility in the market and in a trusts net asset value if legislation or state or federal regulators impose additional requirements or restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to make loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions the availability of senior loans for investment may be adversely affected in addition such requirements or restrictions could reduce or eliminate sources of financing for certain borrowers this would increase the risk of default if legislation or federal or state regulators require financial institutions to dispose of senior loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions or subject such senior loans to increased regulatory scrutiny financial institutions may determine to sell such senior loans such sales could result in depressed prices the price for the senior loan may be adversely affected if sold at a time when a financial institution is engaging in such a sale some senior loans are subject to the risk that a court pursuant to fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws could subordinate the senior loans to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other action detrimental to lenders such court action could under certain circumstances include invalidation of senior loans any lender which could include a fund held by a trust is subject to the risk that a court could find the lender liable for damages in a claim by a borrower arising under the common laws of tort or contracts or antifraud provisions of certain securities laws for actions taken or omitted to be taken by the lenders under the relevant terms of a loan agreement or in connection with actions with respect to the collateral underlying the senior loan  floating rate instruments a floating rate security is an instrument in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates on a periodic basis based upon changes in a benchmark often related to interest rates as a result the yield on such a security will generally decline with negative changes to the benchmark causing an investor to experience a reduction in the income it receives from such securities a sudden and significant increase in the applicable benchmark may increase the risk of payment defaults and cause a decline in the value of the security assetbacked securities assetbacked securities abs are securities backed by pools of loans or other receivables abs are created from many types of assets including auto loans credit card receivables home equity loans and student loans abs are issued through special purpose vehicles that are bankruptcy remote from the issuer of the collateral the credit quality of an abs transaction depends on the performance of the underlying assets to protect abs investors from the possibility that some borrowers could miss payments or even default on their loans abs include various forms of credit enhancement some abs particularly home equity loan transactions are subject to interest rate risk and prepayment risk a change in interest rates can affect the pace of payments on the underlying loans which in turn affects total return on the securities abs also carry credit or default risk if many borrowers on the underlying loans default losses could exceed the credit enhancement level and result in losses to investors in an abs transaction finally abs have structure risk due to a unique characteristic known as early amortization or early payout risk built into the structure of most abs are triggers for early payout designed to protect investors from losses these triggers are unique to each transaction and can include a big rise in defaults on the underlying loans a sharp drop in the credit enhancement level or even the bankruptcy of the originator once early amortization begins all incoming loan payments after expenses are paid are used to pay investors as quickly as possible based upon a predetermined priority of payment mortgagebacked securities mortgagebacked securities are a type of abs representing direct or indirect participations in or are secured by and payable from mortgage loans secured by real property and can include single and multiclass passthrough securities and collateralized mortgage obligations mortgagebacked securities are based on different types of mortgages including those on commercial real estate or residential properties these securities often have stated maturities of up to thirty years when they are issued depending upon the length of the mortgages underlying the securities in practice however unscheduled or early payments of principal and interest on the underlying mortgages may make the securities effective maturity shorter than this rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of mortgagebacked securities making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates and may reduce the market value of the securities in addition mortgagebacked securities are subject to prepayment risk the risk that borrowers may pay off their mortgages sooner than expected particularly when interest rates decline sovereign debt sovereign debt instruments are subject to the risk that a governmental entity may delay or refuse to pay interest or repay principal on its sovereign debt due for example to cash flow problems insufficient foreign currency reserves political considerations the relative size of the governmental entitys debt position in relation to the economy or the failure to put in place required economic reforms if a governmental entity defaults it may ask for more time in which to pay or for further loans there is no legal process for collecting  sovereign debt that a government does not pay nor are there bankruptcy proceedings through which all or part of the sovereign debt that a governmental entity has not repaid may be collected us government obligations risk obligations of us government agencies authorities instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity however not all us government securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states obligations of certain agencies authorities instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises of the us government are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states eg the government national mortgage association other obligations are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury eg the federal home loan banks and others are supported by the discretionary authority of the us government to purchase an agencys obligations still others are backed only by the credit of the agency authority instrumentality or sponsored enterprise issuing the obligation no assurance can be given that the us government would provide financial support to any of these entities if it is not obligated to do so by law money market securities certain funds held by a trust may invest in money market securities if market conditions improve while a fund has temporarily invested some or all of its assets in high quality money market securities this strategy could result in reducing the potential gain from the market upswing thus reducing a funds opportunity to achieve its investment objective derivatives risk certain funds held by a trust may engage in transactions in derivatives derivatives are subject to counterparty risk which is the risk that the other party in a transaction may be unable or unwilling to meet obligations when due use of derivatives may increase volatility of a fund and reduce returns fluctuations in the value of derivatives may not correspond with fluctuations of underlying exposures unanticipated market movements could result in significant losses on derivative positions including greater losses than amounts originally invested and potentially unlimited losses in the case of certain derivatives there are no assurances that there will be a secondary market available in any derivative position which could result in illiquidity and the inability of a fund to liquidate or terminate positions as valued valuation of derivative positions may be difficult and increase during times of market turmoil certain derivatives may be used as a hedge against other securities positions however hedging can be subject to the risk of imperfect alignment and there are no assurances that a hedge will be achieved as intended which can pose significant loss to a fund recent legislation has called for significant increases to the regulation of the derivatives market regulatory changes and rulemaking is ongoing and the full impact may not be known for some time this increased regulation may make derivatives more costly limit the availability of derivatives or otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives examples of increased regulation include but are not limited to the imposition of clearing and reporting requirements on transactions that fall within the definition of swap and securitybased swap increased recordkeeping and reporting requirements changing definitional and registration requirements and changes to the way that funds use of derivatives is regulated no one can predict the effects of any new governmental regulation that may be implemented on the ability of a fund to use any financial derivative product and there can be no assurance that any new governmental regulation will not adversely affect a funds ability to achieve its investment objective the federal income  tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in the asset that a derivative provides exposure to which may adversely impact the timing character and amount of income a fund realizes from its investment the tax treatment of certain derivatives is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation regulation or administrative pronouncements options a trust may hold a fund or funds that write sell or purchase options as part of its investment strategy in addition to general risks associated with derivatives described above options are considered speculative when a fund purchases an option it may lose the premium paid for it if the price of the underlying security or other assets decreases or remains the same in the case of a call option or increases or remains the same in the case of a put option if a put or call option purchased by a fund were permitted to expire without being sold or exercised its premium would represent a loss to a fund to the extent that a fund writes or sells an option if the decline or increase in the underlying asset is significantly below or above the exercise price of the written option a fund could experience substantial and potentially unlimited losses there can be no assurance that a liquid market for the options will exist when a fund seeks to close out an option position reasons for the absence of a liquid secondary market on an exchange include the following i there may be insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions may be imposed by an exchange on opening transactions or closing transactions or both iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions may be imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options iv unusual or unforeseen of an exchange or the options clearing corporation occ may not at all times be adequate to handle current trading volume or vi one or more exchanges could for economic or other reasons decide or be compelled at some future date to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options if trading were discontinued the secondary market on that exchange or in that class or series of options would cease to exist however outstanding options on that exchange that had been issued by the occ as a result of trades on that exchange would continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms a funds ability to terminate overthecounter options is more limited than with exchangetraded options and may involve the risk that broker dealers participating in such transactions will not fulfill their obligations if a fund were unable to close out a covered call option that it had written sold on a security it would not be able to sell the underlying security unless the option expired without exercise the hours of trading for options may not conform to the hours during which the underlying securities are traded to the extent that the options markets close before the markets for the underlying securities significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the options markets additionally the exercise price of an option may be adjusted downward before the options expiration as a result of the occurrence of certain corporate events affecting the underlying equity security such as extraordinary dividends stock splits merger or other extraordinary distributions or events in certain circumstances a reduction in the exercise price of an option could reduce a funds capital appreciation potential on the underlying security to the extent that a fund purchases options pursuant to a hedging strategy the fund will be subject to the following additional risks if a put or call option purchased by a fund is not sold when it has remaining value and if the market price of the underlying security remains equal to  or greater than the exercise price in the case of a put or remains less than or equal to the exercise price in the case of a call the fund will lose its entire investment in the option also where a put or call option on a particular security is purchased to hedge against price movements in a related security the price of the put or call option may move more or less than the price of the related security if restrictions on exercise were imposed a fund might be unable to exercise an option it had purchased if a fund were unable to close out an option that it had purchased on a security it would have to exercise the option in order to realize any profit or the option may expire worthless the writing selling and purchase of options is a highly specialized activity which involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions the successful use of options depends in part on the ability of a funds adviser to predict future price fluctuations and for hedging transactions the degree of correlation between the options and securities or currency markets if a fund employs a covered call strategy a fund will generally write sell call options on a significant portion of the funds managed assets these call options will give the option holder the right but not the obligation to purchase a security from the fund at the strike price on or prior to the options expiration date the ability to successfully implement the funds investment strategy depends on the fund advisers ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured thus the use of options may require a fund to sell portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on an investment or may cause the fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell the writer seller of an option has no control over the time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation as a writer seller of the option once an option writer seller has received an exercise notice it cannot effect a closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the option and must deliver the underlying security at the exercise price as the writer seller of a covered call option a fund forgoes during the options life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security underlying the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call option but has retained the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline the value of the options written sold by a fund will be affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of the underlying equity securities an increase in interest rates changes in the actual or perceived volatility of securities markets and the underlying securities and the remaining time to the options expirations the value of the options may also be adversely affected if the market for the options becomes less liquid or smaller an option is generally considered covered if a fund owns the security underlying the call option or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration or if required liquid cash or other assets are segregated by the fund upon conversion or exchange of other securities held by the fund in certain cases a call option may also be considered covered if a fund holds a call option on the same security as the call option written sold provided that certain conditions are met by writing selling covered call options a fund generally seeks to generate income in the form of the premiums received for writing selling the call options investment income paid by a fund to its shareholders such as a trust may be derived primarily from the premiums it receives from writing selling call options and  to a lesser extent from the dividends and interest it receives from the equity securities or other investments held in the funds portfolio and shortterm gains thereon premiums from writing selling call options and dividends and interest payments made by the securities in a funds portfolio can vary widely over time swaps certain funds held by a trust may invest in swaps in addition to general risks associated with derivatives described above swap agreements involve the risk that the party with whom a fund has entered into the swap will default on its obligation to pay a fund and the risk that a fund will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to the agreement swaps entered into by a fund may include but are not limited to interest rate swaps total return swaps andor credit default swaps in an interest rate swap transaction two parties exchange rights to receive interest payments such as exchanging the right to receive floating rate payments based on a reference interest rate for the right to receive fixed rate payments in addition to the general risks associated with derivatives and swaps described above interest rate swaps are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk in a total return swap transaction one party agrees to pay another party an amount equal to the total return on a reference asset during a specified period of time in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or on the total return from a different reference asset in addition to the general risks associated with derivatives and swaps described above total return swaps could result in losses if the reference asset does not perform as anticipated and these swaps can have the potential for unlimited losses in a credit default swap transaction one party makes one or more payments over the term of the contract to the counterparty provided that no event of default with respect to a specific obligation or issuer has occurred in return upon any event of default such party would receive from the counterparty a payment equal to the par or other agreedupon value of such specified obligation in addition to general risks associated with derivatives and swaps described above credit default swaps involve special risks because they are difficult to value are highly susceptible to liquidity and credit risk and generally pay a return to the party that has paid the premium only in the event of an actual default by the issuer of the underlying obligation as opposed to a credit downgrade or other indication of financial difficulty forward foreign currency exchange contracts certain funds held by a trust may engage in forward foreign currency exchange transactions forward foreign exchange transactions are contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of a specified currency or multinational currency unit at a price and future date set at the time of the contract forward foreign currency exchange contracts do not eliminate fluctuations in the value of nonus securities but rather allow a fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time this strategy can have the effect of reducing returns and minimizing opportunities for gain indexed and inverse securities certain funds held by a trust may invest in indexed and inverse securities in addition to general risks associated with derivatives described above indexed and inverse securities are subject to risk with respect to the value of the particular index these securities are subject to leverage risk and correlation risk certain indexed and inverse securities have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates or index levels than other securities and a funds investment in such instruments may decline significantly in value if interest rates or index levels move in a way a funds management does not anticipate  futures certain funds held by a trust may engage in futures transactions in addition to general risks associated with derivatives described above the primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts and options are a the imperfect correlation between the change in market value of the instruments held by a fund and the price of the futures contract or option b possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a futures contract and the resulting inability to close a futures contract when desired c losses caused by unanticipated market movements which are potentially unlimited d the investment advisers inability to predict correctly the direction of securities prices interest rates currency exchange rates and other economic factors and e the possibility that the counterparty will default in the performance of its obligations while futures contracts are generally liquid instruments under certain market conditions they may become illiquid futures exchanges may impose daily or intraday price change limits andor limit the volume of trading additionally government regulation may further reduce liquidity through similar trading restrictions repurchase agreement risk a repurchase agreement is a form of shortterm borrowing where a dealer sells securities to investors usually on an overnight basis and buys them back the following day if the other party to a repurchase agreement defaults on its obligation under such agreement a fund held by a trust may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement if the seller fails to repurchase the security under a repurchase agreement and the market value of such security declines such fund may lose money short sales risk certain funds held by a trust may engage in short sales because making short sales in securities that it does not own exposes a fund to the risks associated with those securities such short sales involve speculative exposure risk a fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale if the price of the security increases between the date of the short sale and the date on which such fund replaces the security sold short a fund will realize a gain if the security declines in price between those dates as a result if a fund makes short sales in securities that increase in value it will likely underperform similar funds that do not make short sales in securities they do not own there can be no assurance that a fund will be able to close out a short sale position at any particular time or at an acceptable price although a funds gain is limited to the amount at which it sold a security short its potential loss is limited only by the maximum attainable price of the security less the price at which the security was sold short sale transactions involve leverage because they can provide investment exposure in an amount exceeding the initial investment a fund may also pay transaction costs and borrowing fees in connection with short sales commodities certain funds held by a trust may have exposure to the commodities market this exposure could expose such funds and to greater volatility than investment in other securities the value of investments providing commodity exposure may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments  concentration risk concentration risk is the risk that the value of a trust may be more susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular sector because the trust provides exposure to investments concentrated within a particular sector or sectors consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors the profitability of companies that manufacture or sell consumer products or provide consumer services will be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends in the past there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail industry particularly the department store segment the continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the industrys ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social conditions to attract and retain capable management and to finance expansion weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits in addition competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of sales campaigns increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry in many sectors of the retail industry competition may be fierce due to market saturation converging consumer tastes and other factors many retailers are involved in entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research costs energy sector energy companies may include but are not limited to companies involved in production generation transmission marketing control or measurement of energy the provision of component parts or services to companies engaged in the above activities energy research or experimentation and environmental activities related to the solution of energy problems such as energy conservation and pollution control the securities of companies in the energy field are subject to changes in value and dividend yield which depend to a large extent on the price and supply of energy fuels swift price and supply fluctuations may be caused by events relating to international politics energy conservation the success of exploration projects and tax and other regulatory policies of various governments as a result of the foregoing the securities issued by energy companies may be subject to rapid price volatility any future scientific advances concerning new sources of energy and fuels or legislative changes relating to the energy sector or the environment could have a negative impact on the petroleum products sector while legislation has been enacted to deregulate certain aspects of the oil sector no assurances can be given that new or additional regulations will not be adopted each of the problems referred to could adversely affect the financial stability of the issuers of any petroleum sector securities  financials sector banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business in addition banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulations banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes such as the grammleach bliley financial services overhaul legislation permit new entrants to offer various financial products technological advances such as the internet allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks government authorities in the us and other countries may engage in administrative and legislative action intended to address both short and long term difficulties facing the housing and mortgage lending markets mortgage backed securities the financial services industry and the broader economy these government actions may include but are not limited to restrictions on investment activities increased oversight regulation and involvement in financial services company practices adjustments to capital requirements the acquisition of interests in and the extension of credit to private entities and increased investigation efforts into the actions of companies and individuals in the financial service industry no one can predict any action that might be taken or the effect any action or inaction will have it is possible that any actions taken by government authorities will not address or help improve the state of these difficulties as intended no one can predict the impact that the difficulties will have on the economy generally or financial services companies the difficulties and corresponding government action or inaction may have far reaching consequences and your investment may be adversely affected by such developments banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in the past including but not limited to the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act enacted in august  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of   the grammleachbliley act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the rules and regulations promulgated under these laws companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates and competition from new entrants in their fields of business adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence the financial health of customers equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition from new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in investment management and brokerage activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and self regulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect the stock prices of such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including but not limited to interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other natural or manmade disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophic losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions results of operations and cash flow the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claim settlement practices the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are subject and various regulatory and other legal  actions the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products and the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture health care sector healthcare companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotech managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the healthcare field these companies are subject to governmental regulation of their products and services a factor which could have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or services furthermore such companies face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete the research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for several years such companies may also have persistent losses during a new products transition from development to production and revenue patterns may be erratic in addition healthcare facility operators may be affected by events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other hospitals efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar thirdparty payor programs legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in congress from time to time these proposals span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which might  include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs national health insurance incentives for competition in the provision of healthcare services tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans industrials sector general risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy intense competition consolidation domestic and international politics excess capacity and consumer spending trends in addition capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by

ecommerce initiatives furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their individual industries industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new equipment aircraft order cancellations disputes over or ability to obtain or retain government contracts or changes in government budget priorities changes in aircraftleasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel information technology sector information technology companies generally include companies involved in the development design manufacture and sale of computers and peripherals software and services data networking and communications equipment internet access and information providers semiconductors and semiconductor equipment and other related products systems and services the market for these products especially those specifically related to the internet may be characterized by rapidly changing technology product obsolescence cyclical markets evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions the success of companies in this sector depends in substantial part on the timely and successful introduction of new products an unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting a companys products or in the market for products based on a particular technology could have a material adverse effect on an issuers operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that any particular company will be able to respond in a timely manner to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace factors such as announcements of new products or development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have caused and are likely to cause the market price of hightechnology common stocks to fluctuate substantially in addition technology company stocks have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies such market volatility may adversely affect the market price of shares of these companies some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently available only from single sources there can be no assurance that in the future suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner accordingly an issuers operating results and customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for or an  interruption or reduction in supply of any key components additionally many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product vendors to comply with rigorous industry standards any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or reduction of sales because many products and technologies of technology companies are incorporated into other related products such companies are often highly dependent on the performance of the personal computer electronics and telecommunications industries there can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders or that an issuer will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other customers similarly the success of certain technology companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies accordingly a decline in demand of such products technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse impact on companies in this sector many technology companies rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and protect their proprietary rights in their products and technologies there can be no assurance that the steps taken to protect proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of technology or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to an issuers technology in addition due to the increasing public use of the internet it is possible that other laws and regulations may be adopted to address issues such as privacy pricing characteristics and quality of internet products and services the adoption of any such laws could have a material adverse impact on the issuers of securities in the information technology sector like many areas of technology the semiconductor business environment is highly competitive notoriously cyclical and subject to rapid and often unanticipated change recent industry downturns have resulted in part from weak pricing persistent overcapacity slowdown in asian demand and a shift in retail personal computer sales toward the lowend segment industry growth is dependent upon several factors including the rate of global economic expansion demand for products such as personal computers and networking and communications equipment excess productive capacity and the resultant effect on pricing and the rate of growth in the market for lowpriced personal computers materials sector companies in the basic materials sector are engaged in the manufacture mining processing or distribution of raw materials and intermediate goods used in the industrial sector these may include materials and products such as chemicals commodities forestry products paper products copper iron ore nickel steel aluminum precious metals textiles cement and gypsum basic materials companies may be affected by the volatility of commodity prices exchange rates import controls worldwide competition depletion of resources and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control devices in addition they may be adversely affected by technical progress labor relations and governmental regulation these companies are also at risk for environmental damage and product liability claims production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of overbuilding or economic downturns which may lead to poor investment returns telecommunication services sector general risks of telecommunication services companies include rapidly changing technology rapid product obsolescence loss of patent  protection cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions certain communicationsbandwidth companies are subject to substantial governmental regulation which among other things regulates permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a company may offer such companies can also be negatively impacted by any failure to obtain or delays in obtaining financial or regulatory approval for new products or services companies in this sector are subject to fierce competition for market share from existing competitors and new market entrants such competitive pressures are intense and communications stocks can experience extreme volatility companies in the telecommunications sector may encounter distressed cash flows and heavy debt burdens due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition particularly in formulating new products and services using new technology technological innovations may also make the existing products and services of telecommunications companies obsolete in addition companies in this sector can be impacted by a lack of investor or consumer acceptance of new products changing consumer preferences and lack of standardization or compatibility with existing technologies making implementation of new products more difficult utilities sector general problems of utility companies include risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result of environmental nuclear safety and other regulations regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer energy conservation technological innovations which may render existing plants equipment or products obsolete the effects of local weather maturing markets and difficulty in expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors natural or manmade disasters difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and equity securities and increased competition in addition taxes government regulation international politics price and supply fluctuations and volatile interest rates and energy conservation may cause difficulties for utilities all of such issuers experience

growth for the  fiscal year finished at  which was higher than the original financial plan estimate of  higher overall tax collections were primarily attributable to higher business tax collections across all components which were particularly driven by a stronger underlying liability for the corporate franchise tax higher audits for the bank tax and fewer than anticipated corporate franchise tax refunds paid lower than projected total disbursements occurred in multiple spending categories including local assistance state operations and general state charges lower spending in these

service obligations net operating results for  fiscal year were  million less favorable than anticipated in the final financial plan with net operating results in the final financial plan projected at

by sp global ratings a division of sp global inc and aa by moodys investors service inc any explanation concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies there is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn local issuances it should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations issued by local new york issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of obligations issued by the state of new york and there is no obligation on the part of the state to make payment on such local obligations in the event of default the foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject additionally many factors including national economic social and environmental policies and conditions which are not within the control of the issuers of such bonds could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of the state and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof the sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of such bonds to pay interest on or principal of such bonds additional deposits each trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of additional securities or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities in such trust and the issuance of a corresponding number of additional units in connection with these deposits existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities  between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and other acquisition costs administration of the trust distributions to unitholders by regulated investment companies making semiannualquarterly distributions or grantor trusts the discussion in this section applies to all trusts other than trusts that are regulated investment companies for tax purposes that have monthly distribution dates income received by a trust is credited by the trustee to the income account for the trust all other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate capital account for the trust the trustee will normally distribute any income received by a trust on each distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record date a trust will also generally make required distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year if it has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their pro rata share of the available balance of the income account of the related trust all distributions will be net of applicable expenses there is no assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends received may be used to pay expenses in addition excess amounts from the capital account of a trust if any will be distributed on each distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record date provided that the trustee is not required to make a distribution from the capital account unless the amount available for distribution is at least  per  units proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the capital account and not distributed until the next distribution date applicable to the capital account notwithstanding the foregoing if a trust is designed to be a grantor trust for tax purposes the trustee is not required to make a distribution from the income account or the capital account unless the total cash held for distribution equals at least  of the trusts net asset value as determined under the trust agreement provided that the trustee is required to distribute the balance of the income account and capital account on the distribution date occurring in december of each year the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the capital or income accounts but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of such funds the distribution to the unitholders of a trust as of each record date will be made on the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially equal to the unitholders pro rata share of the available balance of the income account of the trust after deducting estimated expenses because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the year such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate distributions to unitholders by regulated investment companies making monthly distributions the discussion in this section applies if your trust is a regulated investment company that has monthly distribution dates income received by a trust is credited by the trustee to the income account for the trust all other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate capital account for the trust the trustee will normally distribute income received by a trust on each distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the trust generally pays distributions from its income account prorated on an  annual basis along with any excess balance from the capital account on each monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date as described in greater detail below all distributions will be net of applicable expenses the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends or trust expenses change the trust will also generally make required distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year if it has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes excess amounts from the capital account of a trust if any will be distributed at least annually to the unitholders then of record proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the capital account and not distributed until the next distribution date applicable to the capital account the trustee shall not be required to make a distribution from the capital account unless the cash balance on deposit therein available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at least  per  units the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the capital or income accounts but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of such funds the distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on the following distribution date or shortly thereafter when the trust receives dividends from a portfolio security the trustee credits the dividends to the trusts accounts in an effort to make relatively regular income distributions the trusts distribution from the income account on each distribution date to each unitholder is equal to such unitholders pro rata share of the cash balance in the income account calculated on the basis of a fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the total number of distribution dates per year of the estimated annual income to the trust for the ensuing twelve months computed as of the close of business on the record date immediately preceding such distribution after deduction of  the fees and expenses then deductible pursuant to the trust agreement and  the trustees estimate of other expenses properly chargeable to the income account pursuant to the trust agreement which have accrued as of such record date or are otherwise properly attributable to the period to which such distribution relates because the trust does not receive dividends from the portfolio securities at a constant rate throughout the year the trusts income distributions to unitholders may be more or less than the amount credited to the trust accounts as of the record date in the event that the amount on deposit in the income account is not sufficient for the payment of the amount intended to be distributed to unitholders on the basis of the computation described above the trustee is authorized to advance its own funds and cause to be deposited in and credited to the income account such amounts as may be required to permit payment of the related distribution to be made as described above in such an event the trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed without interest out of income payments received by the trust subsequent to the date of such advance any such advance shall be reflected in the income account until repaid general persons who purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person becomes a record owner a person will become the owner of units and thereby a unitholder of record on the date of settlement provided payment has been received notification to the trustee of the transfer of units is the responsibility of the purchaser but in the normal course of business the selling brokerdealer provides such notice  the trustee will periodically deduct from the income account of a trust and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the capital account of the trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trust the trustee also may withdraw from said accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of the related trusts assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts in addition the trustee may withdraw from the income and capital accounts of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemptions of units statements to unitholders with each distribution the trustee will furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of other receipts if any which are being distributed expressed in each case as a dollar amount per unit the accounts of a trust are required to be audited annually at the related trusts expense by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor unless the sponsor determines that such an audit is not required the accountants report for any audit will be furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request
