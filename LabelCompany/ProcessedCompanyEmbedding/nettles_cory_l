comments nettles will focus on bring high paying jobs to wisconsin cory l nettles is not shy about his passion for creative innovative solutions to help stimulate wisconsin’s economy which faces record budget deficits and a reliance on mature industries his challenge as the new secretary of commerce is to stimulate wisconsin’s economy and grow the diversity of its business portfolio wisconsin technology network founder and editorial director mike klein had the opportunity to sit down with cory nettles to discuss his perspectives goals and plans on how technology can have a significant role in building evolving and growing the state’s economy a look around the secretary’s office shows that nettles is all business his office is orderly and appears well run there is an atmosphere that is welcoming but make no mistake about it this secretary is all business he appears to have fun while talking succinctly about his plans to execute new strategies and tactics to grow the wisconsin’s economy nettles relies on the latest technology devices to keep him informed up to date and prepared for the daytoday challenges he faces cory l nettles a yearold milwaukee native is the youngest

has represented corporations in product liability and commercial litigation he also has represented small businesses nonprofit groups and community churches governor doyle appointed cory nettles secretary of the department of commerce in january  he is referred to internally as “the governor’s point man” on economic development issues and will act as a catalyst for economic growth through his leadership of the approximately  department of commerce employees governor doyle and secretary nettles are both committed to a “new day economy” a theme consistent with doyle’s winning election campaign in which the principals of fiscal management reducing the deficit and moving beyond what the governor refers to as “irresponsible budgeting” gov doyle said he chose nettles because “cory is a bright young rising star who will bring energy and enthusiasm to the important job of growing wisconsin ‘s economy and making sure there are good wellpaying jobs available to all citizens of wisconsin  i know that cory has the ability and the confidence to actively and aggressively sell wisconsin as a great state to live do business and raise a family” said doyle “he understands that retaining our best and brightest college students and attracting young professionals and business to our state are essential components to improving wisconsin ‘s business and economic development climate” he added secretary nettles has pledged that he will focus on bringing highpaying jobs to wisconsin  to do that he wants to expand wisconsin’s technology and biotechnology industries increase training in those fields and work closely with the university of wisconsin system here are his specific thoughts on technology and economic development as told to mike klein of the wisconsin technology network wtn wtn governor doyle campaigned on the theme “a new day” in light of the state’s budget crisis with accompanying departmental budget cuts that have been announced what are your goals for technologybased economic development and how do you accomplish them to improve the state’s economic stature nettles we have to do a much better job of marketing ourselves with the right technology–based products message and then by telling our story both within and outside the state wisconsin has a very good intellectual property products and biotechnology story to sell domestically and internationally the medical devices and instrumentation industry is doing very well they have fast growing sales and their exports have been rising off the charts the first steps in getting to a “new day economy” are to manage in a fiscally responsible way and continue to reduce the deficit large deficits hamstring our ability to do effective economic development the second thing we need to do is to manage our resources and do a better job of being leaner smarter and more efficient we cannot assume that bigger governmental budgets and bureaucracy necessarily translate to economic development the department of commerce has to do a great job of managing and marketing even with fewer resources the next thing is that we need to look hard with a fresh eye as to what our strengths and weaknesses are and do a better job of developing those strengths as well as release the power that we have in those particular sectors of the economy that can distinguish ourselves on a national level wtn what are your strategies to balance wisconsin’s current economic activity with the need to grow and expand in new technology market segments nettles wisconsin has some very mature sectors of its economy that have been wonderfully successful and still play a very primary role in our current economy but our past success in those areas cannot limit our thinking about other developing opportunities the governor is thinking about those sectors of the economy that are less traditional and where we wisconsin have distinguished ourselves the opportunities that we have in technology will be a real important part of our economic development plans wtn will the administration focus more on technologybased economic development and less on wisconsin’s traditional manufacturing economy nettles do we focus on technology or do we focus on manufacturing the answer is yes the governor wants to have a very broad and diverse economic development strategy we don’t want to put all our eggs in one basket whether it’s biotech it information technology transportation manufacturing or agriculture we want to look at businesses and start ups that have the ability to distinguish themselves competitively locally nationally and internationally irrespective of markets and to support them as best we can we will not load up on one segment at the detriment of others we are not going to bet the farm on one or two particular segments and hope they pop wtn will the investments in technologybased businesses help the rest of the state nettles what is happening is that the people who are in the marketplace everyday appreciate the practical application of technology in every sector of our economy there are proven benefits of increased efficiencies that are a result of it applications we need to start appreciating and talking about the symbiotic relationship between business and technology and make this message more broad and obvious we need to focus on the integration coordination and application of technology additionally we should take our technology developed in wisconsin and make sure that through proper technology transfer we are applying that technology in manufacturing applications and business so that every sector of our economy can benefit from technological improvements wtn do you plan to offer tax incentives to attract business to wisconsin and to stimulate start up companies in the state nettles i think tax and economic incentives are secondary what we primarily have to offer are really good opportunities for businesses that are looking to expand and grow in wisconsin we have to sell all the benefits that the state has to offer including quality of life as well as the talented well trained hard working people in wisconsin incentives only matter at the margins as it relates to traditional businesses we try to have a broad arsenal of honest incentives which we can provide as deal sweeteners such as tax credits and access to low cost capital the people we need to be working and partnering with whether they are wisconsin businesses venture capitalists or out of state industries are smart enough to take a hard look at what we do wtn recently the governor traveled to eau claire to award silicon logic engineering sle with a  “technology zone” tax credit and a  low interest loan why was this company chosen and what was the process sle is to use the incentives to develop a specific semiconductor intellectual property standard that will target highspeed communication computer chips funding this project is one is part of wisconsin’s new strategy toward promoting technology development and global competitiveness nettles silicon logic engineering was the first company we chose to benefit under the “technology zone” tax credit program this was a nobrainer project this is a company that both on paper and in practice is doing everything right they really have distinguished themselves in terms of their principals who are a spin off from cray computing and are welldocumented success they were a dream first project sle has seasoned expert managers strong intellectual property and a sound business plan with strong equity ratios sle’s project will create  new jobs retain  jobs and leverage  in additional investment for technology research and development wtn how has your professional training as an attorney prepared you for your new job as secretary of commerce nettles my legal training has really helped me with so much that i do day in and day out my training has helped me to be more creative and to appreciate that there is more than one way to help businesses my job is often creative problem solving my objective as a lawyer was to help business with whatever legal issues that were presented i always talk about how the legal issues provide a backbone of underlying business objectives this is a “new day” in wisconsin and we need to ask ourselves “what can we do creatively to bring more resources to the table wtn how will the governor’s approach to economic development differ from the previous administrations nettles the governor is very handson completely engaged and very committed he spends a large part of his day thinking about how to manage through our current budget crisis and on the other hand he thinks about how to alleviate that crisis by growing the economy the governor the administration and the department of commerce will be an active player we will be more aggressive more engaged and creative than the previous administration the governor really gets it he understands the role and benefits that technology can
