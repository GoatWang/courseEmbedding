pinterest twitter youtube  creative inking blog hop two step stamping welcome thank you for stopping by  i have a fresh and summery card for you today i created this card with the delightful daisy stamp set and coordinating punch  this stamp set is considered a two step stamping because the stem is a separate image so you can stamp it as step  in one color old olive was used here and then in step  stamp the flower in a separate color crushed curry  i also used the layered leaves embossing folder for the background and the softly falling embossing folder for the flower centers i stamped the flower two times on crushed curry card stock and punched out both flowers with the daisy punch the i cut the flowers in half to change the daisies into brown eyed susan flowers note this new punch has out sold every other punch we have carried the last  years  because of the extreme popularity stampin up it is currently out of stock the punch and the bundle that includes the punch and the stamp set are currently not able to be ordered until approximately the first week in august  if you would like to be notified when the punch is available to order contact your demonstrator the greeting is from the flourishing phrases stamp set  i stamped it in early espresso and cut it out with the layering ovals dies  the crushed curry  mini chevron ribbon was the perfect accent the flower center is punched out with the  circle punch  additional products used are listed below time to hop along and see what fantastic project bj peters has for us today or you can click here to go back to sue

two or more products that are sold together at a discount  my customers love the bundles because these are products that are made to go together and you can save money  i have several favorite bundles in this new catalog so it was tough to decide which one to focus on today  but in the end i just had to go with the colorful seasons and season layers framelit thinlits dies  i love the versatility of this bundle and i know i will be using it in every season of the year   this card was made using mostly the dies except the outside sentiment which is from the stamp set and this card was made using just the stamps from the colorful season set   as you can see by the huge number of dies in this set ive barely cracked the surface on all the possibilities with this great bundle   both cards also feature the beautiful color theory designer paper stack  this pretty paper is in a  x  stack and features and ombre and paint chip look on one side and a crackle design on the other i love this adirondack chair from the die set  it just says summer to me  and the peek of the branches and color theory paper through the oval window adds a lot of depth to this card here is a peek at the inside of the card  the greetings are from the happy birthday gorgeous stamp set which is part of another great bundle i used the multipurpose liquid glue to attach the branch and mini glue dots to attach the flowers here is a quick peek inside the berry burst card  i used the better together stamp set for the inside of this card i hope you give this bundle a try  it is a lot of fun time to see what bundle bj peters is focusing on today or you can go back and visit sue lehrer and see her favorite bundle click here to place your order in my online store  or click any of the pictures below to go

a simple card with lots of elegance in vanilla and dapper denim i started with an  x   piece of vanilla and cut the detailed circle from the eastern medallion thinlit dies and then laid a circle from the layering circle dies in the center after cutting that out i laid a piece of  x   piece of vanilla behind the front piece and using the top piece as a guide to center one of the smaller detailed circle dies from the eastern medallion thinlits then i removed the top piece to place the next die i love the laser cut look of these dies and how the eastern beauty stamp set was designed to coordinate with this set the inside piece is attached with dimensionals to give the card depth this fabulous bundle is available now from your stampin up demonstrator  you will be amazed with all of

 beautiful blue ombre butterflies with the beautiful wings embosslit another bright happy spring card today  this one im playing with the ombre look again  ombre is very big right now  in clothes

week  i hope you can join us some of the stampin up colors fit perfectly for the ombre technique  for my butterflies ive used soft sky pool party coastal cabana and bermuda bay to cut out the butterflies i used an embosslit for the big shot diecut machine called beautiful wings embosslit  not only does it cut out all of the butterfly shapes but it also embosses a different design on each  as you can see in this close up im really happy with how this card turned out  i love the clean crisp look of white on white with just a dash of color  i used the new arrows embossing folder for the

hexagon hive thinlits die for the big shot on this one   this is a cool new die from the occasions catalog but there are some tips i wanted to share with you for getting the best results from this beautiful die  you need to use wax paper between the die and the card stock when you send it through the machine  this helps the card stock come out of the die without tearing those thin borders  i also found that with my big shot machine i needed to add an extra piece of card stock between the magnetic platform and the bottom plate to shim  what stunning results you will get if you do these two simple things the crazy mixed up love stamp set had the perfect image for this card with the little bee i added some dazzling diamonds glitter to his wings to make him sparkle and punched him out with the hexagon punch of course   i also popped the hive cut out up on dimensionals so it would really standout  i also think it adds depth to the card dont you agree here is a quick peek at the inside of the card  this image is from the delightful dozen set the pink pirouette ribbon made a nice finishing touch to the card and it helps draw the eye to the bee which is the focal point   thanks for

agree the new banner collection framelits really jazzed up the card and the speckle stamp from the gorgeous grunge set adds some interest this was one of the cards we made in my hearts and valentine

 then on another piece of whisper white we stamped the lava lamp image in stazon jet black ink  then we took the black stamped image and cut out the pieces of the lamp that we wanted to be black  in this case the base and top of the lamp  then we glued them over the red version using the two way glue pen   for the inside of the card we used a stamp set tags  you that was in the holiday catalog and is still availabe to order  we punched it out with the label bracket punch  the speckle stamp from the gorgeous grunge was used again to tie it in with the design on the front of the card the

cute im excited to show you this super easy diagonal cut technique which you can adapt to any patterned paper that you have i have short video below and a photo of the super simple cut  so easy that you can make a lot of this card layout in a hurry  perfect for your holiday cards    here is the short video  not fancy but it shows you how  im still dealing with the broken arm and editing a video is a challenge with only one hand so its not fancy but i think it does the job although you can make the diagonal cut any where i wanted all my cards to be the same  so i used these dimensions this photo also shows how to cut paper that has a directional pattern like this one   after i have cut it with the stampin trimmer a peek at the inside of the card with a different pattern from the same package of paper to embellish my card i used an adorable stamp set and punch bundle called cookie cutter christmas i did some simple coloring with the new real red  crumb cake marker twin pack from the stampin up holiday catalog or if you dont like to color you can skip the antlers and just color the nose and the inside of the ears like i did on this version these little jingle bells are adorable  and they really jingle you get both silver and red in the package of bells and the bakers twine is also a two pack with both colors  so what are you waiting for grab some patterned paper and a trimmer and give it a try pups are growing and keeping me amused while my broken arm heals we got a new hammock so that we can hang outside with the pups more and enjoy the gorgeous fall weather

the spotlight technique i will walk you through the technique with step by step on how to watercolor with the watercolor pencils  these pencils have been a hugely popular and are currently on low inventory status  once they sell out we will not be getting more inventory until april so order yours today here this beautiful floral scene is actually preprinted designer paper called inside the lines it is available free with a  stampin up purchase through the end of march or while supplies last  for the spotlight technique you punch out one area that you want to highlight after punching you color just that area and then punch a slightly larger circle to layer it on  this circle basic black on this card makes the image pop the inside of the card with the so in love stamp set watercolor pencils can be used as colored pencils or as a paint with the blender pens  to get the shading variations i follow this technique  first i lightly color the image all over with my main color barely pressing at all to get a light base  if you are going to be blending it with the blender pen it does not have to be pretty or fill in all the areas  just a light base coat  im using the rich razzleberry pencil here next i go back in with the same color pencil and press firmly in areas that i want to shade i like to shade on the bold lines of the image again it does not have to be smooth and perfect that will happen with the blender pen with your blender pen start by blending all of the light areas  then use a circular motion to blend the darker areas being careful to leave some light

favorite permalink  comments      creative inking blog hop color my world   today i want to share a couple of fun stamping techniques on this sweet easter card made with the basket bunch  basket builder framelits dies first i will focus on the coloring since that is the theme of our blog hop today i stamped the images in stazon jet black on thick whisper white card stock and then colored in a few parts of the image using the stampin up watercolor pencils  specific colors used were bermuda bay melon mambo daffodil delight and basic gray i then blended the pencil using the clear wink of stella glitter brush and spread it to fill in the open areas  i was nervous the first time i did this  i was afraid that the color would stain my clear wink of stella  but i quickly discovered all i need to do when i am done with one color is brush the tip on a scrap paper a few strokes and it will turn clear again  then i move on to the next color the basic gray was just a few strokes on each side of the face and sides to add shading  tada  it gives you a beautiful professional coloring effect with a gorgeous shimmer throughout the card itself is called a floating image card  which worked perfectly with my egg juggling bunny  i stamped the images from the basket bunch stamp set colored them and cut them out with the coordinating dies from the basket builder framelits dies then i attached them with glue dots to a piece of window plastic inside my window that i cut with the layering square framelit dies i cut another set of images in plain white to put on the back side of the window to cover up the glue dots here is a close up of the inside greeting thanks for joining me today have fun trying out these two great stamping techniques on your own projects time to hop on over
