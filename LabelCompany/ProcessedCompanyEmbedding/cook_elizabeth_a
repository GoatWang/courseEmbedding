by elizabeth cook was released may   on the thirty one tigers label elizabeth cook comes to country music naturally her parents had a working honky tonk band and her first public performance was onstage with them when she was just a tyke welder songs early in her recording career she tried going the mainstream nashville majorlabel route but she was probably too pure country for that making her home in the indie world shes free to be herself  which is how an album as individualistic as welder came to be  but her topshelf talent still attracts bigtimers like don was who produced the record its telling that not california the only track not written by either cook or her husbandguitaristrighthand man tim carroll sounds immediately anomalous in its broad power ballad feel and seems like a conscious attempt at a radio song the rest of the album is pure cook not only because her offbeat sensibility and potent dolly partonlike delivery brand everything she does but because theres more than a bit of autobiography going on here cooks mother passed away between welder and its predecessor and mamas funeral is an account of the titular event that paints a portrait devoid of mawkishness or manipulation coming off more like the work of prime parton or tom t hall of the late s when she sings unflinchingly  though not without a touch of black humor  about a heroin addict sister it seems a pretty safe bet that cook is speaking from some kind of reallife experience if not being completely literal and it also seems pretty certain that carroll is the character at the center of rock n roll man   see full description welder buy cd music product reviews uncut magazine p   stars out of   shes a throwback to bonnie owens and loretta lynnthe music is tough raw and often
