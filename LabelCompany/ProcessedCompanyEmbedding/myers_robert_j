maryland the interview was transcribed by sharon mohr of ssas office of library records  reprographics mr myers made edits and corrections to the raw transcript the questions and any editorial comments are shown in italics to distinguish them from mr myers remarks q you began your career as a young junior actuary with the committee on economic security in  can you tell us how that happened how you came to be there how you came to start your career with social security what were the circumstances myers well it was a matter really of great good luckbeing in the right place at the right time i had in june of  received my masters degree in actuarial science from the university of iowa which was one of only two schools in the country that at that time had actuarial courses my professor henry lewis rietz was a member of the actuarial advisory committee to the committee on economic security which had been established to make studies looking forward to the development of the social security program and when i graduated there were no jobs available none of the people in my class had got jobs except those who had been sent there by their insurance company and the company took them back so i was back home in philadelphia looking for a job and one day i got a letter from professor rietz saying very complimentarily that i was his unemployed actuarial student who lived nearest to washingtonwould i be interested in a week temporary job as a junior actuary with the committee on economic security i didnt know what that was either but i knew what a job was and  weeks was fine so my principal qualification therefore was geography because most of the other students were from the midwest so i came down and was interviewed for the job by edwin witte and got offered the job and took the job and the  weeks turned out to be much longer because i came down about september  the work at the committee on economic security extended on for a number of months until the recommendations were made and then legislation was developed and congress considered it but the money available to the committee on economic security expired on june   just before the social security act was finally enacted during the first two or three months of this job i was working under two qualified actuaries who were there on loan one from travelers insurance company wr williamson and one from att otto richter and then when they lefti by that time got a bit of educational experience on how to make the cost estimatesi kept making cost estimates for the various proposals that were considered by the committee on economic security and then on the legislation as it went through congress on june   the job expired i got a temporary job with the works progress administration as a statistician as you know the social security board as it was then called didnt get an appropriation for quite awhile because of a filibuster by senator huey long for some peoplelike wilbur cohen and othersthey found some money for them through the labor department to start the planning the social security board didnt really get money until sometime in  and they didnt particularly need actuaries to start with they needed people to plan the administration and that sort of thing and so then i got a temporary actuarial job with the railroad retirement board which was here in washington at the time q before we go to that can i ask you about your first meeting with witte and your first impression of him and what he was like at that first interview did he make any impression on you of a particular kind myers no i guess being a young college student i was scared to death it was a short meeting he didnt ask me much he knew what my qualifications were from professor rietz but he had to have a facetoface meeting with me i guess i cant remember anything much at all about it q ok during that time you worked at ces was he present during your work did you interact with him or did you work mostly with richter myers well mostly with richter who worked on the oldage side williamson worked on the unemployment side and then i also worked with doug brown and barbara armstrong i saw witte occasionally i dont recall any particular meetings q how about altmeyer he was the head of the technical staff which the folks you just mentioned were a part of myers again i dont recall q at that time he wasnt prominent in your day to day work myers not at all q you did mention barbara armstrong douglas brown and i think murray latimer as the three people working on the oldage side did you work with them did you have many dealings with them can you tell us a little bit about them myers essentially my dealings with them initially were just through richter those people would get together and decide on a plan who was to be covered and the benefit formulas and richter would set up the calculations and i would do them so although i saw the people i wasnt in on any of the meetings and i cant say that i developed any of the recommendations specifically then later when richter went back to att id be dealing with latimer doug brown and barbara armstrong to some extent when they would say what would the program look like if it were framed in this and that way what would it cost what are the projections q i believe you have some documents there concerning the actuarial estimates done for the ces what are those documents and what is their significance myers its the actuarial worksheets underlying the original social security act of  i have copies of the worksheets i gave them to your predecessor sid leibowitz and he made a photocopy which i have here it was transmitted to leibowitz on march   so presumably it is somewhere in your files these worksheets are numbered ra ra and ra the r standing for richter otto richter richter being the actuary who was in charge of the oldage pension side of the work of the committee on economic security also im giving you a note of july   which may explain these worksheets a little and indicating some things that are very important that might otherwise be abstruse as well as a letter of april   that i wrote to wilbur cohen and murray latimer explaining the basis underlining these worksheets as i remembered it and did they recall the same and both of them agreed as you recall when the house passed the bill in  it did not include a retirement earnings test not because the house didnt want to do this but they werent quite sure how to write it and they left that up to the senate if benefits were paid to everybody beginning at age  whether they worked or not the cost would be quite high the question then was how to make the estimates for the senate which did put in a retirement earnings test of a general nature in essence the senate provision prohibited paying benefits to a person who had any substantial gainful activity q at one point you were called in to work on providing some actuarial estimates that would account for a retirement test can you just describe what that was about myers yes this was with murray latimer when the senate was going to put an actual retirement test in because i was told the house didnt know exactly how to write it so they just said well well leave that up to the senate but then there was to be the general principle that the plan was to be selfsupporting up through  and the retirement test was in there and what i did was to work backwards as to what assumption of the average retirement age would make the plan selfsupporting and so i made the estimate on that basis the plan is going to be selfsupporting and then worked back to see what that assumption would involve as the average retirement age which turned out to be   which i didnt think was unreasonable if it had taken something like age  i would have said i cant stand in back of this estimate but at that timewith no experience except what you knew about how long people worked and so forth and the benefits werent that big that people were going to rush forth to retire just to get the benefitsthe resulting figure of  seemed to me to be a reasonable assumption q if there had been no retirement test in the law then it would have been more difficult for the program to be selfsupporting for it to be in actuarial balance myers yes because what youre saying in essence is that benefits are paid automatically at age  regardless of cessation of employment and obviously more benefits would be paid than if you assume that people retired at   and the system would not have been selfsupporting with the tax schedule that was in the proposal q im very interested in this issue of the retirement test because theres a very common what i consider to be a myth about the retirement test and i want to check if im right its now said by some people that the retirement test was put in the law in order to discourage older workers to get them out of the labor force so that younger workers could take their place and that was the intent of the retirement test and then these people would argue we no longer need that sort of effect and therefore we dont need a retirement test any more is that an accurate description of what happened and how the retirement test came to be in the law or is that a myth thats evolved myers thats a myth that ive frequently pointed out that was a byproduct perhaps that people would retire but my demonstration of why its a myth is that the average benefit was going to be maybe  a month and the average wage was around  a month so people werent going to rush out leave  jobs to get  benefits and that wasnt going to remove very many people from the labor market at the same time both the house and the senate wanted a bill that was selfsupporting in other words it would be financed solely by the payroll taxes and the interest earnings of the reserve account that is there would be no government subsidy from general revenues the way the committee on economic security left it the program did depend on general revenues and president roosevelt more or less vetoed that idea the house and senate were going along with a selfsupporting program with no effect on the general budget deficit of the government the problem then arose as to how you would actuarially take account of the retirement earnings test obviously this was going to reduce costs very considerably there was no experience to draw on we had to estimate the impact based on general reasoning about what we might expect what was done was to develop various estimates as explained in this note i have just written and as youll see from these worksheets i experimented with various reduction factors in other words reducing the benefits by multiplying by  percent and by  percent and finally by  percent and  percent worked out fine the system was just selfsupporting it built up the famous  billion reserve at the end of  and all the criteria were satisfied now one thing though this  percent reduction had to produce some sort of reasonable result if it required an average retirement age of  that would have been obviously wrong now as i calculated the  percent factor is equivalent to an average retirement age of   which i didnt think was unreasonable as it turned out in actual experience people are retiring earlier and of course  is the earliest you can retire with full benefits so  is on the high side and probably something like  or  might have been better at any rate this was to express the general principle of self support q as you said the proposal that originally came out of ces was for a program that wasnt fully selfsupporting there was going to be some general revenue subsidy in the program president roosevelt had given them guidance to not do that and secretary of the treasury morgenthau was opposed to that but the report as it came out still had those general revenue estimates in it and at the last minute as the bill was being considered in ways and means the ces had to go back and revise the actuarial projections and make it selfsupporting what was your role in all this were you involved in the policy debate or just in doing the calculations myers in the calculations not in the development of what the revisions were and as much as i might have liked to i didnt participate in the meetings when they said were not going to have a government subsidy in the system and weve got to have a selfsupporting system and that sort of thing q did you have a strong view on that at that time myers i think so ive always been opposed to government subsidies because i think that the cost should be out in the open so how strong i felt about it at that time i really cannot say q during those early days i believe you also met wilbur cohen who was also a young staffer at the ces myers yes he was there about a week before i was q and did you know wilbur did you meet him and work with him during that ces period myers yes we were about the same age and we were all around it was a small office and i saw him but i wouldnt say i worked directly with him but a lot of times hed come around and ask for information because he was as you know wittes gofer q the last thing about the ces periodcan you just give us some idea of what the work environment was like was it hectic was it slowpaced just some idea of what it was like if you can myers well it was my first job of that type it didnt seem to me to be overly hectic you worked along and you worked hard but there werent lots of late hours the way ive spent some with some legislation in the s and s and so forth there wasnt any of that people i think just worked hard worked fairly normal hours some of us worked some at night but it wasnt anything that i would say was hectic q which is kind of surprising because you had such a short time period to do all the work myers thats true maybe the others did and i just didnt notice it maybe i had other things on my mind q you mentioned that when the ces came to an end that you briefly went to work for the works progress administration so lets pick back up with that if we can what did you do there and what was that like what was wpa like for that brief period that you were there myers i was just doing statistical work i was only there about three or four months and it was in the same building and somebody i knew was there and they had this job available it was as a junior statistician i was working on various characteristics of the relief population like one thing was a very esoteric problem of what is the geographic center of the relief population as there is the center of the total population in other words the center of population is the place you know the concept is that its the point in the uswhich is somewhere west of the mississippi and then its been moving west over the years where the distance from that point to every person in the united states is a minimum as compared to if that point were somewhere else i guess the census bureau still calculates the center of population but it doesnt get publicity anymore but anyhow the guy that i was working for thought it would be interesting to seesince it had just come out for the  censuswhat was the center of the relief population which i suspected would be somewhat to the east of the center of the total population and various statistical analyses like that but as soon as i got offered an actuarial job at the railroad retirement board rrb i quit because the railroad retirement board was in the field that i had decided i was going into they had an actuary and they had three or four junior actuaries i was made the second in command but way below the chief actuary the rrb was here in washington at the time and so i took that and i was there close to a year until ssa got some money for actuaries and brought williamson back and he wanted me to come so immediately i left q can you tell us a little about williamson he would be at ssa for awhile until i guess about  as the chief actuary myers  actually the title then was actuarial consultant q can you describe him a little to us and give us a little bit of an impression of him his working style what was that period like while you were working there as a junior actuary myers when i was working under williamson there were four or five actuaries doing various types of work my assignment was the continuation of what i had been doing making the cost estimates for the existing system for proposals and so forth some of the others were working on things like coordination of private pensions with social security because there was a lot of talk then about opting outthe clark amendment was being considered and whether people should be able to opt out of social security and some of the other actuaries were working on things like that birchard wyatt in fact was in the actuarial division the actuarial office had an actuarial section and a technical section wyatt was the head of the latter section and they worked on various aspects of the program and i suppose considered some of the plans that were being made to change the program even before it got into operation or just as it was getting into operation also an advisory council was coming into existence so i worked as it were directly under williamson and we did have a deputy chief actuary dorrance bronson but i worked fairly independently without any supervision williamson was a wellqualified actuary he had been at travelers insurance for years he was very much interested in group insurance and of course group insurance is closely related to social insurance in many ways and he was generally supportive of the program in the beginning but then he got less and less enamored of it and particularly he was in favor of what he called social budgeting by that he meant he was in favor of universal flat benefits rather than earningsrelated benefits he had the view which i think had merit that it was unfair that all those who had retired before social security began got nothing and those who were in social security for just a few years just enough to qualify got real actuarial bonanzas and that wasnt equitable and he tried to urge that they ought to change the system and that it ought to not be an earningsrelated system and the more he thought about it the stronger he got that way and he got into a lot of conflict with the social security board and eventually there was a parting of the ways he was a very talkative fellow and sometimes he was hard to follow he talked so much and in long sentences and things like that and sometimes it was hard to understand just what he was driving at i thought so and i think others thought so but essentially there was this conflict and the rift grew and grew until he no longer could staythey didnt fire him he resigned he resigned in part also because another opportunity arose because wyatt went out and formed a pension consulting company and then died at a fairly early age after maybe only two or three years there wyatt was not an actuary but he had a number of actuariesdorrance bronson went there they needed somebody to hold the company together so they convinced williamson to come and be the president and as you probably know the wyatt company theyve changed the name now to watsonwyatt is one of the most prominent actuarial consulting firms in the country so it was a good opportunity as i say with this growing conflict it just seemed to be a good way to resolve the issue q now you left ssa the social security board for awhile when the war started and did a few other things myers well i left when the war started because uncle sam said youre drafted it was not voluntary so i was drafted and i got a three or four month deferment because i was running the second actuarial valuationthey were triennial every three yearsfor the railroad retirement system because the actuary for that program joseph glenn got fired he was a capable guy whom i worked for after i left the committee on economic security but he was also a very hardheaded stubborn guy like actuaries generally i guess and he told the railroad retirement board that he wasnt going to do the second valuation because it wouldnt show anything different than the first well i dont know where he got that view because after all the law said do it so you do it even if it does show the same results and he left and they needed someone to do it and the actuaries they had there were not fullyqualified the way i was and i had the experience so i was loaned to the railroad retirement board and my being drafted into the army was deferred and then after completing the valuation i was drafted after basic training i got pulled back to washington to work in the medical statistics division of the surgeon generals office because the guy who headed that up was a statistician that i knew and he got me and several other actuaries to work there they previously had a bunch of doctors who werent capable doctors running the medical statistics division they werent capable statisticians either so it was a terrible mess so we straightened it outit was just a straight statistical operation statistical recording not much analysis and i was given a direct commission so i fought and won most of the war here in washington q and you came back to myers the way i came back to the social security administration was interesting i dont know whether it was in my book or not but when the war was over in europe and they were saying how you could get out of the armyyou had to have a certain number of points and you didnt get many points if you had only been in the us so it looked as though i was going to be in the army forever i got approached to get out of the army and go to germany as part of the reorganization and review of their social security system so reluctantly in some ways because it meant leaving my family i said yes i would go and they told me to go home and stay at home until they cut the orders for me to go to germany and that gave me some of the best luck in my life i was sitting at home one day and the phone rang and i picked it up and the fellow said this is congressman wolvertonhe was a republican from new jersey and was at that time chairman of the house interstate and foreign commerce committee he said id like you to come and work for me were going to work on railroad retirement legislation and id like to have you work with the committee i said fine id be glad to do it but theres one small problemim in the army at the moment about three days later i was out of the army and i worked for the committee for several months and when that was finished then i was free to go back to social security and i went in the meantime bronson had left social security and gone with the wyatt company he was going to stick around and wait until i got out of the army but he couldnt wait that long so i went back and williamson was still there then williamson left and the opening was there after a number of months they decided that maybe i could be the chief actuary but they thought i was too young theymeaning the social security board and altmeyerinquired around among a number of actuaries as to whether i would be acceptable to the actuarial profession and it turned out that i would so i was named in  as chief actuary or rather actuarial consultant as the position was then called q lets talk a little bit about the profession of the actuary because in many respects its kind of unusual can you just explain a little bit about the profession of the actuary and how you qualify and how was it for example that you were qualified to become the chief actuary at this point in your career myers the actuarial profession is unlike any other that i know the cpas of course have exams but theyre given by the states the actuarial exams are given entirely by what is now the society of actuaries there used to be two life actuarial organizations they merged in essence they worked closely together so they were really one actuarial organization there was also one in the casualty field but lets just talk about the one in the life field which is now the society of actuaries they set these exams anybody can take them and theyve always been nonsexist nobody knew from the papers who the person was that was taking the exam if you passed them you passed them the number of exams has changed from time to time back when i was taking them there were twelve now theres a very complicated system but the exams start off with basic math that most any college student will have they go through actuarial math involving life insurance pensions and annuities and statistics and then go into various subjects one of them being social insurance the others are insurance law insurance accounting insurance underwriting and various aspects of the insurance business from an actuarial standpoint and when you pass all those exams then youre a fellow of the society of actuaries and you are a qualified actuary q now when you came to ssa when you assumed the job of chief actuary what was the role of the actuary within ssa in terms of how you dealt with the policy makers how you dealt with the commissioners office what was your role in the organization as the chief actuary how would you describe how the actuary worked myers lets go back originally the actuaries were all concentrated under williamson and there was this feud as it were between williamson and the social security board they clipped his wings some and set up a separate actuarial unit in baltimore because as you know the actuarial office was in washington and all the records and other things were in baltimore they set up this shortrange unit in baltimore with qualified actuaries and the unit in washington then just dealt with longrange mattersshortrange meaning in the next few years the baltimore unit did things like estimating what the operations of the trust fund were going to be in the next few years and also they did estimating as to the number of claims that would be filed in district offices and various other claims activity that were needed for administrative planning in the longrange unit we looked at the longrange situation of the present plan and various proposed amendmentswere they adequately financed or how they should be financed and so forth and so there was this separation of functions the two offices naturally talked to each otherthe longrange estimates had to tie in with the shortrange ones in  they put the two pieces back together and put it under my supervision but i left the shortrange unit to operate as it was i paid some attention to what they did but it seemed to be operating well and i let it keep operating in this manner q now theres always been this kind of tradition of the actuaries being very objective and apart from policy and politics can you talk a little bit about that tradition myers i feel very strongly about that the actuary regardless of what he or she thinks of various proposals that are put forth should make the best possible estimate for them it may not be right but it should be the best that you can make regardless of whether its a good proposal or a bad proposal and the policy makers shouldnt influence you and say we dont like thisput a high cost on it or this is our proposal lets say it doesnt cost so much and to the best of my knowledge very rarely has anyone ever tried to breach that principle there was a very good writeup about the work of the office of the actuary over the years in the conference report on the independent agency bill and i would refer you to that i use that quite a bit because they talk in there about why they did not put in the bill that there should be a legislated position of chief actuary although later this was done but nonetheless the tradition of the past has been thus and i would say unfortunately at the moment its being breached some for many years we operated on the basis that congress and congressional stafferseither sidecould come to us and ask for estimates and wed give them to them this didnt have to be cleared with anybody else i understand from some of the hill staffers that it isnt that way anymore and i think thats bad usually what was done was that my superiors would be told we had been asked for cost estimates for this or that or the other thing but we would give the inquirers the figures first and just report what we told them in other words the facts were all out there this i think has been one of the strengths of the program that we dont have separate actuarial units in congress and in the administration who might be fighting over whether the assumptions were right in other words everybody played the game on the same assumptions as i say maybe the assumptions turned out not to be good but they were honestly and professionally made one other thing in this respect too that has changedto some extent but not greatly at certain points both the senate finance committee and the house ways and means committee when i was chief actuary asked for my services to be available to them on a confidential basis and the powers that be the secretary or the commissioner agreed that i was to work for them and i did not have to tell the administration what i was doing and what they were thinking because there were times when congress and the executive branch had different ideas when amendments were upnot drastically different like they are now where some people want to destroy the system they had different approaches and i was given the authority so that i was not breaching confidentiality i was given authority to work for them and so i was on their staff at the same time i wouldnt tell them what the administration was up to or i wouldnt tell the administration what wilbur mills was up to this was out in the open and there was no breach in confidence involved because the powers that be in the department thought this was in the best interest of moving things along q thats an extraordinary degree of independence that the actuary has enjoyed over the years myers it isnt that much any more as i understand it q now was that tradition already in place from the earliest days of the social security board would you say that it always functioned that way or that it was something that happened when you were the actuary myers no it happened but not because of me but rather due to the timing because there was no legislation after  amendments for ten years so when the  amendments were started in  this is when this started happening whereas i became chief actuary in  and this has been noted there was a book i think by manley from the brookings institution in which he wrote about the ways and means committee and pointed out that this was a most unusual thing that somebody from the executive branch in essence worked simultaneously for congress and some of my printed actuarial reportsits not this way anymorewere signed robert j myers actuary to the committee sometimes id be working both for the republicans and the democrats and they would come to me as though i was a staffer of the committee they used to have these actuarial cost estimate reports this is one done in  and it just says prepared for use of the committee by its staff and if you look at an earlier oneheres one from  that says by the office of the actuary q very interesting now the other part of that tradition of no one asking you to shade the numbers and shade the estimates i assume was there from the beginning even before you began to work closely with the congress myers i would say so there was only one instance i ever knew when in  the republicans came in roswell perkins was assistant secretary as is frequently the case and as is often justified political figures were often suspicious of the career civil servants and he said one or two things along these lines and i gave him a lecture and that was the end of itwe got along fine q you talked in your book about the tradition of providing longrange forecastsof the idea that we should project the operation of the program far into the future and make certain that it was in actuarial balance and that seems to have been a feature of the actuarial estimates that you introducedit was partly at your insistence could you describe what that issue was and how you introduced that tradition myers you said it well yourself first of all the idea of longrange estimates was not one that was widely accepted throughout the world years and years ago i know from going to international conferences of actuaries or issa international social security association meetings many of the european countries did not believe in longrange projections year by year figuresthey said well just have to look ahead a few years or well use present value calculations do you know what i mean by present value q ive come across it a hundred times and ive never understood it yet myers its very simple if youre a certain age and have a life annuity of  per year coming to you and have a life expectancy of  years thats going to have a present value of  or something like that on the basis of a specified interest rate the reason being that if you have  in a fund and you pay out  each year and you get interest at whatever rate you assume that fund will just run out when the last survivor diesactually you dont use life expectancy because that says that everyone lives exactly  years and then drops dead and that is inaccurate its close but not right actually one uses a life table you start out with  people at a certain age and they drop off until the last one dies if you start with  at  the last one may die at  and by actuarial calculations you can figure out this present value of maybe  in many social insurance systems they did everything by present value and private pension plans often do that the present value of all the future benefits is determined for the duration of the last active employeeso they project out  or  years the present value of the benefits is x million dollars and they figure out what fixed contribution rate do we need say  percent of payroll the present value of all those contributions will equal the present value of the benefits the projection method was not widely usedi didnt invent it but it was not widely used the europeans just didnt look ahead and i think that over the years theres been quite a change of opinion more and more the british did the projections and also the canadians and now others are doing this if theyd done this they would have seen as we did the effects of the baby boom all this talk now about the baby boom has been no surprise to the actuaries of ssa or to the policy makers of ssa who saw the work of the actuaries you see these things by projections that you dont see in a presentvalue calculation q so the idea that were so familiar with now that appears in every trustees report every yearthe longrange year actuarial balance of the system and showing that projection year by yearthat was really an innovation that was introduced while you were the chief actuary myers yes in fact it used to be not a year period but perpetuity some people wonder how can you get a single finite figure for perpetuity when thats millions of years because of the discounting of interest you can and ill give you a simple example suppose somebody agrees to give you and all your survivors  a year forever the total amount that would pay is infinite of course but the present value of that is finite the reason is say interest is  if you have  that will produce  every year forever so the present value of that stream of infinite figures is  we used perpetuity as the basis for some years and assumed that after  years everything stabilized you can make the calculations even though its a perpetual calculation through actuarial mathematics it can be done quite simply as i did that  bank deposit and this was done until about  but some people said we dont understand this perpetuity so why not just do it for  years or  years i objected strongly to that because i saw the baby boom coming and i said you ought to at least encompass that effect and so  years seemed a reasonable period because thats about the maximum lifetime of the youngest worker in the system a year old worker and so it was switched over to a year period it doesnt make that much difference between  years and infinity but it does make some and it made the cost of the program a little less but this was all recognized at the time the change was made im still an infinity guy because even if you have a  year period every year you do a new valuation you have some slippage if conditions were exactly the same the assumptions were not changed and the experience was just like the assumptions the evaluation made later would show if it was in balance in year one by year two it would be out of balance by a tiny amount say  of payroll q due to what myers the way the present system is it wouldnt be that situation if we had a truly payasyougo program but in the present system that situation with a level tax rate in the last year of the year valuation period the cost is higher while in the first year the cost is lower q one of the features of the year estimates that we have now is that we are able to say in a fairly definitive way whether the system is actuarially in balance or not in balance and that concept that test of in balance or not in balance has become the key political measure of the performance of the program so its a very important innovation i would say myers i think it is and should be wilbur mills particularly was very strongly in favor of this procedure he wanted to be able to go to the floor of the congress and say this system is an actuarial balance after what weve done the only problem as i say is with this creep q which is sort of a technical problem myers yes and it wouldnt be there if the tax rates were on a payasyougo basis a level tax rate is too high in the beginning and too low in the end and you get that creep q now you alluded to the fact that some people i think even among your actuarial staff thought that we should just do shortterm estimates myers not the actuarial staff q oh okay myers some of the policy people they took this approach i think because they said about looking at the long range this stops us from expanding the program because things look good right nowthey look great for the next ten years if we only looked ahead ten years wed say theres no problem yet we know there are going to be problems because of the demographic situation q but you would say the responsible thing to do is to do longrange estimating myers yes definitely and recognize that youre not going to be precise youre not going to hit it but its going to give an indication of the trends that are inevitably there from demographic causes q now theres another story of a policy issue that was introduced after you left as chief actuary i think it was in  and i wanted you to talk about that as i understand it prior to this change our estimates didnt factor in inflation it assumed steady wage levels rather than inflating wage levels can you explain what that issue was and what the change meant myers i was always in favor of having what i call static estimates when it was a static program in other words the plan didnt call for automatic increases q youre talking about the cola cost of living allowance myers the cola and raising the earnings base and the retirement test amounts there were some in the policymaking side who said that you ought to make the estimates for a static plan by assuming that the economic conditions are going to change in other words wages are going to increase i argued against this i said when wages go up then well take it into account and thats how a large part of some of the liberalizations or benefit increases in the s and s were enacted when there were several years of wage increases wed take that into account and the cost of the program would show to be lower because of the weighted benefit formula i said you shouldnt count your chickens until theyre hatched as it were i think again that some people wanted to take these economic assumptions into account because it would make a static program look less expensive and therefore you could liberalize the benefits thats not rightyoure counting the chickens before theyre hatched so i stood strong against that now on the other hand when automatic adjustments are introduced into a system then its fine to have dynamic economic assumptions but the two had to go handinhand q i want to clarify in my own mind a few things about the actuarial estimates there are a couple of criticisms that people sometimes make about the actuarial estimates one of them is that the actuarial estimates dont reflect economic cycles a related contention is that they are not based on any kind of economic model can you explain for me what the issue is in these arguments myers yes ill be glad to try well first of all as to why economic cycles are not built into the longrange estimates it seems to me to be virtually impossible to know just when the cycles are going to occur and the point is you make economic assumptions that average out what the cycles do and as long as you have a sufficient fund on hand it can weather these economic cycles now with shortrange estimates in essence economic cycles are built in the highcost estimate in effect assumes there is going to be bad economic conditions and the lowcost estimates assume there is going to be good economic conditions so economic cycles are builtin to the shortrange estimates but in the longrange trying to predict  or  years from now that theres going to be an economic downturn or upturn just seems to be at the heights of impossibility as to econometric models maybe im just an old fogy but i think often that is a matter of windowdressing its just fashionable to say that we have a model and its some kind of secret black box that has more wisdom than mankind does but in a sense what the actuary has always done could be described as a model and what theyre doing now is supposed to be much more refined than what we did in the early days and even in the somewhat later days but it is a model in that you build a method which you can describe in terms of its various steps and assumptions some of these are just actuarial studies that the actuary puts out and in a sense theyre models but they arent the kind that people would describe as an econometric model where you feed in a couple of assumptions and the computer grinds and grinds and out comes a nice answer but rather these type of models you can see step by step whats being done in other words you start off with the basic population of the country and in order to get the payroll taxes we assume what percentage of people of various age groups are going to be gainfully employed and what their average earnings are by various ages and so on in a sense id say its a model im not enough of an expert to really condemn econometric models that much but thats my general impression q on a related point you have said that the actuarial estimates are not forecasts of the future behavior of the program and that people who try to use them as forecasts are making a conceptual error of some kind can you explain this point myers yes its like a weather forecast forget what the weather is going to be tomorrow if its going to be hot and rainy or something like that the farther out into the future you go the less the weather forecaster will actually forecast he or she will say at this time next year theres likely to be no snow or its likely to be hot but they wont give a precise answer in the longterm actuarial estimates we say under these assumptions this is what will happen and we know certain things are bound to occur for example we knew that the baby boomers were going to result in a much larger retirementage population than currently we also knew that as mortality decreased or in other words longevity increased there would be a greater proportion of the population who would be elderly and retired a forecast would say specifically how many but the projections would say we think under these assumptions this will be the result however under other assumptions there would be this many more or this many less the point of distinction between projection and forecast is that the actuary is never one to say we know with certainty whats going to happen and this viewpoint is taken not only out of the standpoint of intellectual honesty but also a matter of personal safety because no matter what you did it was very likely that the future would be somewhat different and at least the estimates would portray the general trends in other words if we only looked ahead  years we might make what i would call a forecast and particularly if we just went a year ahead we could forecast within  or  percent pretty well but the farther out you go the more likely it is to be off but if you stop at  years you would be failing for example to portray what is certain to happen as in this case with the baby boomers we know theyre here we knew  years ago they were here and we know theyre going to be living to  so theres going to be this general trend and thats why we call them projections as against forecasts q let me see if i understand this so the point of the actuarial projections is not to predict for example whether the economy will be growing or contracting in a particular year or whether there will be an up cycle here and a down cycle there that really doesnt matter so much because the point is to depict the broad general trend in the performance of the trust funds over the estimating period and whether we can have confidence that the trust funds will be in balance over the period taken as a whole myers exactly its the trend that youre announcing and i think theres been some experimenting with adding business cycles on top of an existing estimate and you end up in about the same place if you have an economic downturn the trust fund balance falls below the trend line and when you have an economic upturn it rises above the trend line in general the trend is what is important also an important aspect of the cost estimates the longrange cost estimates is to use them as sort of a yard stick to evaluate proposed legislative changes so for example when amendments are proposed to liberalize benefits which used to happen much more than it does now you have a standard to measure them you are then in a position to say if you do this it will increase the cost by say  percent the necessary questions can then be asked as to how we propose to meet that cost and if youre proposing this that or the other thing that the proposal will or will not meet the  percent so even though the estimate wont be a forecast it will be a good indication of whats likely to transpire if you change the system in certain ways q so now let me try to get a handle on the question of how policy makers should use the actuarial projections the actuaries provide a range of forecasts we now show an optimistic projection a pessimistic projection and an intermediate projection would it be correct to say that policymakers are making defensible choices as long as their assumptions fall somewhere within the range of estimates provided by the actuaries and only if they use estimates outside the range provided would the actuaries say that the policy choices are not based on sound estimates myers yes thats right i would go on to say however that over the years the policy makers have always said lets base our policy changes on the intermediate estimates now i think i would have objected if they said lets base it on the optimistic estimates because if we used these estimates and they were off there would be a shortfall in the programs funding and there are sometimes critics of the program who want to look only at the pessimistic estimates the advantage of having the longrange estimates is to let people know that things might not turn out just the way we are thinking they will in the intermediate estimate we arent claiming to be seers and tell you absolutely whats going to happen the system may have more money than it needs or it may have less and so you should be aware of this and particularly dont take just the optimistic estimates because it may be that the financing will fall short if the assumptions in the optimistic estimate do not come to pass now back in the days beforei guess it was in the late s early sthe economic assumptions were always static in other words it was assumed that wages would not increase in the future even though everybody knew that they undoubtedly would but i always insisted this was the proper way to make cost estimates because the benefit structure was designed based on todays earnings levels without automatic adjustments once automatic adjustments were introduced then fine you can have dynamic assumptions now the way this turned out before automatic adjustments were introduced it was in some sense nice for the actuaries you made the estimates in a certain year on current wage rates and two years later wages had gone up you then make a valuation and you show that the system has a surplus and congress says fine you can increase benefits and the increase was able to be supported in effect it was just what a cpi cola would have done so you just work it out without automatic adjustments in a sense it made everybody look good that they could do this and it didnt appear to cost anythingbenefits could be increased without raising taxes but i think it was the only way to proceed because you couldnt assume that wages were going to increase and the benefit formula would stay the same q let me ask you about the estimates made in  i think one of things that happened in  is that for purposes of the shortrange projections the administration focused on the more pessimistic assumptions and for the longrange estimates they focused on the intermediate or revised intermediate assumptions some people have pointed to this as evidence of political manipulation of the estimates saying that we pick and choose optimistic estimates when it suits us and pessimistic estimates when that suits us now if i understand correctly thats a perfectly appropriate way to make public policy myers yes i think so and especially when its openly said now if we can just step back to  the  amendments were supposed to fix the situation for the short and medium range we didnt bite the bullet over the longrange situation but the difficulty was that in the shortrange the financing was on a very close basis very little margin for safety the tax rate was going to go up in the s and then in  but shortly afterwards it was decided well lets not increase taxes too much and we can get by well by the intermediate estimate you could have gotten by but unfortunately economic conditions in the late s and early s were bad wages didnt go up as fast as prices and with the automatic adjustment features the system ran into trouble the trust funds would have been exhausted in  or certainly by the middle of  but if the system could have been kept going for a little longer it would have come out of it to a considerable extent but that isnt the way the system could operate there was no provision that the trust funds could borrow money and pay it back later and a lot of people would have been skeptical about it and that just wouldnt have been a good procedure the problem in  was that legislative action was taken when the system was approaching financial problems the financing changes were made a little too late so in the  considerations and in the  legislation it was decided look we dont want another crisis in the shortrange the next  yearsthe s lets base the financing on high cost estimates and pessimistic assumptions for the longrange estimates we will use the intermediate assumptions with the shortrange we intentionally assumed pessimistic conditions so that we would not have another crisis and actually many people even after the  amendments were passed said well have another crisis in  or  years you cant trust the government they said that in  and look what happened well it was a different situation as i said in  the financing was based on the intermediate assumptions for the shortrange and intentionally in the  amendments we said lets be safe and as you know we sure got through the s beautifully in my files i have some articles where even some responsible organizations said theres going to be another crisis in  or  years the committee for economic development which is a business group quite moderate and quite responsible they thought we were going to have trouble they didnt understand what the national commission recommended and what the congress did to be absolutely sure it would not happen and now we have a  billion reserve fund q now in  when you were back at ssa as deputy commissioner and the chief actuary reported to you there was something introduced that was a little bit novel instead of having the three standard estimates that we usually have optimistic intermediate and pessimistic there was one additional estimate it was something that was a little bit more optimistic than the intermediate assumption but not quite as optimistic as the optimistic assumption a kind of inbetween now some people have talked about the introduction of this additional estimate as being evidence of some political manipulation by the administration with the estimating process i want you to describe to me how we came up with those four sets of assumptions and what their purpose was myers in the shortrange estimates the next  years omb did not like the assumptions that the actuaries developed for alternative iithe intermediate estimate they said were going to restore the economy and your assumptions are too pessimistic now i did not attempt to be chief actuary when i was deputy commissioner but i sure wanted to back the actuaries up so the actuaries with my support and with jack svahns support said the omb estimates were just too optimistic and we just could not support them the compromise was to have two intermediate estimates so the solution finally was to put in both a a and b set of assumptions a being the optimistic intermediate and b being the true intermediate and what happened in practice was everybody just kept using b and after a few years of doing this finally the ssa actuaries and the board of trustees said this is silly why confuse things with four estimates so we dropped the a one q was this unprecedented was this push by omb to have an optimistic set of assumptions something that happened before did you have those kind of conversations while you were chief actuary myers back when i was there before  omb kept its fingers out of things but more and more and not improperly over the years the trustees and the departments of labor and treasury got more and more interested in the assumptions and the actuaries have had to discuss this with them i think the actuaries have always taken the position that theyll listen to people and if people convince them theyll change but they wont take orders if they think certain assumptions are right thats it now before  there was no outside control over the process at all q but you would not describe this as improper political interference myers no i dont think so except for that issue that you brought up about the a estimate and that really didnt amount to too much anyhow because it was put in there and nobody used it q and even though other agencies are now involved at the end of the day the actuaries get to make the call myers yes i think thats fair to say the chief actuary signs the statement its put in at the end of the trustees report and i think the chief actuary is pretty reasonable about it they dont just take an inflexible stand look this is what i think and this is it i wont listen to you i think their views can be modified and if they are reasonably convinced they are willing to change other people have views on these subjects so i think the actuaries have been reasonable and i think theyve had adequate professional control without attempting to be dictators q during your tenure at ssa during your  years as chief actuary you worked with five different commissioners arthur altmeyer william mitchell john tramburg charles schottland and then bob ball i wonder if you could just take a moment and tell us about the actuarys office during each of those tenures and whether there was anything different about the relationship between the commissioners office and the actuarys office under any of those commissioners myers i cant say that there was any great difference in the relationships except as i said in  somebody decided maybe just because the organizational chart would look better to consolidate all the actuaries under me i know at one point they wanted to move all the actuaries to one geographical locationbaltimoreand i objected to that i wanted to stay in washington because i wanted to be near the hill because of the working relations that i had with people in ways and means and senate finance if youre  minutes down the street its different than if youre  miles away so i objected to that and it wasnt done until after i left q so as far as the role of the office of actuary it didnt change under any of those commissioners it basically was the same during that entire period myers i think its fair to say so i got along reasonably well with all the commissioners that you mentioned except you know why i left q alright lets talk about that next in  you ended up resigning as chief actuary and leaving over differences that you hadlargely i think with commissioner ballbut in general on the issue that the agency was politicalizing the program myers well its not quite that simple q ok would you please describe what happened myers bob ball wont agree with some of the things i say and he didnt like my book and i can understand why maybe we come from different angles but i believe that civil servants should be civil servants and that they should support whatever political administration is in and if the administration is proposing to do things they dont like they shouldnt work under cover to undercut them i dont feel it quite the same as lets say if the soviet union invaded the united states and took the government overas a civil servant i would undercut them its not quite that level of patriotism in dealing with social security as i see it i assert that during the eisenhower administration there was much undercutting of the republican administrationand i am a moderate republican but i think that civil servants regardless of their own political or social views should support the administration theyre working for and should not work undercover with people on the hill who may be of their political views much of that went on in ssa in the eisenhower administration speeches would be written for liberal democratic senators or they would be told what the administration was planning and that sort of thing i couldnt prove it in a court of law but im just fairly certaini said it in my book and ill say it againbecause thats the kind of thing that was going on and it became even more apparent when the republican administration went out in  some people chortled with joy that the democrats were back in and that sort of thing i determined at that point that if this ever happened again i was going to blow the whistle some people have said thats because i wanted to be commissioner when the republicans got back in i say that wasnt the case although every little boy wants to be president one day i thought the job of chief actuary was the best job in the world i would have been commissioner if they would have offered it to me but that certainly wasnt my primary purpose my primary view was i just didnt think it was right when the next republican administration came in in  the same thing continued to happenthe speech writing the passing on undercover of what the administration was considering or going to do helping people write speeches attacking it and that sort of thing so i started making speeches which a civil servant shouldnt do and capped it all by having an article in readers digest which you probably know about then i immediately resigned because i knew that you shouldnt do that but i guess my conscience said to do it it hurt me to leave but i felt i had to do it bob ball doesnt see it that way and he has written me about my book where he disagrees with some of the things i said there but thats the way i saw it and thats the way i still see it q one way of looking at this would be to say that the people who formed ssa were sympathetic politically speaking to the democrats and because during the early years of the program democratic administrations were in charge there was a harmony there and then when the republican administrations came in there was a disharmony in the agency and in the administration first is that sort of what youre saying myers yes thats what i am saying q id take it that your decision to leave in  was a difficult decision to make you had been there from the beginning myers very difficult but it had to be done thats all there was to it q theres one other issue that came up after you left and that was the check stuffer issue in  there had been a custom of putting a stuffer in the check whenever there was a cost of living increase in the past these messages had been technical messages then in  when president nixon was campaigning for reelection the white house wanted a message put in there that basically gave the president credit for that cost of living increase so that he could get some political mileage out of it and your view was that this was an inappropriate procedure and you criticized mr ball in your book for not fighting that issue vigorously enough now i know that since your book has been published you have had some correspondence with mr ball on this subject and he represents that he did work against it but behind the scenes and im wondering if your assessment of that incident is still the same or if it has changed at all myers i know that bob ball objected strongly to the way that i wrote that up but thats the way that i saw it but he ought to know he was closer to it im not saying that he was wrong maybe he did fight it but i think he could have fought it more q clearly in your view that was inappropriate for that check stuffer to be used in that way myers yes of course q then you left ssa and you went on to lots and lots of work and a very busy career after government and then you came back briefly in  you came back in march  and stayed for not quite a year as a deputy commissioner at ssa and i want to talk a little bit about that if we can first tell me why did you come back myers the major incentive was that i wanted to come back because there was a financial crisis and i thought i could do something about it so i wanted to come back and i wanted to be commissioner naturally every little boy wants to be president and i guess every little girl too but i didnt make it jack svahn and i were the ones being considered at a meeting i was told that i couldnt be commissioner but they would like me to be deputy commissioner i still thought i could go back in that capacity and do something about the financing crisis q who was the meeting with was it with the white house or the department myers it was with the secretary richard schweiker and i went back of course you know from my book that it wasnt for financial reasons because i got paid  cents an hour net after considering my civil service retirement annuity but i did have a private car and driver q how did you find ssa when you came back after a decade of being away myers i dont know i was so busy there were many things that i wouldve liked to have done but i was so busy worrying about the crisis and also i tried as hard as i could not to act as thought i was still chief actuarynot to meddle with actuaries any more than id like any other political figure to do but of course i came back with the advantageas a political appointeethat the bureaucrats werent going to pull anything over my eyes because i was there before they were so i had no problem that way but there were many things that i would have liked to have done if this was considered to be a permanent situation but i really felt that i was there just to see what i could do about saving the system and thats the reason i left because when the legislative situation got into a tangle and they had to appoint the national commission i knew thats where the action was going to be i wanted to be a commission member but i didnt make it instead i got to be executive director and some people would say i was in an even better position but anyway thats the way it wasthat was the only game in town so thats the way i played it q ok lets move on to the greenspan commission the first thing i wanted to know is what was your role as executive director of the national commission on social security reform what did you do as executive director myers could i go back just a little bit about why i left being deputy commissioner at ssa and why i resigned basically as i may have said before i wanted to be where the action was i didnt go back for the money as you know i wanted to be where the action was there was a serious financing problem facing social security and i wanted to be a part of the solution i didnt expect to be the guy that did all the solutions but i wanted to be in on it and i could see that the national commission was where the solutions were going to be devised i could play a role at ssa and jack svahn was nice about it when i decided i was going because there were going to be a lot of requests at ssa from the commission but i wanted to be where the action was and that was with the national commission i had been working closely with the republicans particularly in the senate and they had three seats to appoint to the commission the senate then was under a republican majority and they had three seats in the house which had a democratic majority they had two seats i hoped to be one of the senate members and i couldnt be if i was still at ssa i had to resign and take my chances on it but unfortunately the three republicans appointees were all senators and naturally i couldnt compete with them the three senate appointees were senators dole armstrong and heinz but i did not know they would be the appointees and i knew the only way i could possibly get on the commission was not to be at ssa so i resigned now perhaps unwisely when i resigned i expressed a great regret for leaving and strong support for what the reagan administration was trying to do but i couldnt resist taking a swipe at omb now politically that wasnt a wise thing to do but im not a politician i just thought that had to come out because i thought the package of legislative proposals the reagan administration had put together under ombs urging was just untenable and i had to defend it before congress two provisions especially concerned me one was they reduced the minimum benefit for people on the rolls now i agreed the minimum benefit was too high and that not everybody who got the minimum benefit were poor people there were a lot of civil servants who worked after retirement or moonlighted just enough to qualify for the minimum benefit and so got benefits intended for lowwage earners but i thought that eliminating the minimum benefit for people on the rolls we just shouldnt do in fact that provision was in legislation that was passed in  and it was repealed before it went into effect so that turned out alright the other thing that was so bad in the administrations proposal was that benefits for people who retired early were to be reduced not actuarially but arbitrarily so instead of benefits actuarially reduced to  percent of the full benefit they would be reduced to only  percent the argument for this was that people shouldnt retire early and so you should penalize them well i dont believe people should retire early but on the other hand i dont think you should unfairly penalize them i also realized what nobody else was saying at the time the worst criticism nobody thought ofmainly that this was penalizing the poor a wealthy guy a high income guy retiring at  would say nuts to you im not going to take a  percent benefit ill wait  years ive got the money and his or her pension plan likely would be adjusted have sort of a bridge benefit but the poor guy who had to retire on low income had to have it to live on was the guy that got hurt so it was something that hurt the poor and the rich could avoid that was a terrible provision so i couldnt help but take a swipe at omb over those two provisions and it was a dumb thing to do politically it probably killed my chances of being appointed a member of the commission so i was hoping to be a member of the senate majority on the commission however that didnt happen i got appointed executive director of the commission i supposed i pushed it some but i didnt go all out because i thought the administration was never going to appoint me after what i had just done but they did and i was appointed with the approval of the democrats because president reagan and the administration were trying to work with the with them and they tried to do it cooperatively so they were searching for somebody that knew something about the subject and was agreeable to the democrats as well as the republicans and nicely enough despite our differences in some ways bob ball who was sort of a democratic voice on the commission and senator moynihan both agreed i would be good for the job so thats apparently how it got through i wasnt aware of any discussions of alternative people it just came all of a sudden do you want to be executive director it seemed like the secondbest option but when i thought about it it seemed pretty good and many people said i had it better than if i had been a member thats what happened q who offered you the job myers i was interviewed by chairman greenspan whom i had not known before and it was more or less a perfunctory interview since he was the chairman and i was satisfactory to him i may have talked to two or three of the other members i dont have any piece of paper that says will you serve i think i just had a phone call and then a piece of paper came out a press release from the white house saying alan greenspan announces the appointment of robert j myers as executive director and so on initially i think it was just a phone call from an anonymous person saying were thinking of appointing you are you willing yes indeed was my reply the job itself i tried to do it on a professional nonpartisan basis and yet had sort of a split personality in the sense that i was appointed by the republicans and i was a republican and as i say i supported in general what the administration was trying to do yet i tried to be professional about it and be fair to the minority because the commission had  republicans and  democrats and  of the democrats were very conservative democrats the  democrats appointed by the democrats in the house and senate tended to be liberal democrats like bob ball and thats alright i dont use liberal as a bad word but the idea is that i would try to provide information services to them i was told that i had a staff of roughly  people and that  of them would be appointed by the congressional democratic members i hired them but it was like when i was hired by alan greenspanmostly a formality i knew most of these people i interviewed them and they had professional qualifications and so forth they had different philosophies perhaps but were certainly qualified for the job q these were politically appointed staff members myers yes there were definitely three democratic political appointees these were betty dushin merton bernstein and eric kingson there were also two staffers appointed by the republicans two people who in essence i was told to appoint unless i had strong objections which i didnt because they were qualified just like the three democrats one of those was carolyn weaver who worked for senator dole another was a lowerlevel professional and in a sense i was a republican appointee then i needed staffers and i got them all from ssa ssa was very good about lending me anybody i wanted i appointed people whom i had known at ssarenny dipentima virginia reno bruce schobel when i was at ssa i had a personal staff of three personal people bruce was the one and suzanne dilk and annette coates so i just brought them along and tim kelleyhe was a great guy as far as knowing legislation benefit computations and the like and then there were a couple of stenographic employees and they were hired without any political consideration some of the ssa staffers were liberal some conservative but they were all civil servants the idea of the staff was to service the commission arrange the meetings work with alan greenspan on the agenda supply information such as what would it cost to do this what would this package do people developed these packages of proposals and we would evaluate them sometimes the congressional democrats held separate meetings and theyd have their congressional staff there they had certain things in confidence that i never knew other things would come forth with requests for cost estimates and we would get the actuaries to do calculations for us it was the same way with the republican members in general the staff got along well although there was sometimes a little conflict politically but in the end it worked reasonably well what conflicts there were i wouldnt name the person it was one of the democratic staffers he looked on it as being a very political thing and years later he apologized to me for a couple of things he had done it was nothing serious but they all had their own positions staked out there was no sabotage or watergatetype scandal or poking through other peoples desks to see what the other side was up to or any of that so i was in the ambivalent role of trying to be neutral and at the same time being a republican political appointee but my main interest was in the programit wasnt political and i think in general it was the other peoples main interest as well for example carolyn weaver tried to do what dole wanted she had her views and carolyn is a great good friend of mine but i think that sometimes her views are a little more towards cutting back social security but she worked for what the commission was trying to do and in the same way so did claude pepper some of the things that we did he didnt like at all he didnt like the idea of raising the retirement age he didnt believe in any benefit cuts but he went along to his credit and he supported the bill even though he said personally he didnt like some of it this was a deal they made and the other people more or less viewed it the same way q how much influence did you have on the various policy issues that they considered the positions that they took did the republican members ask you for advice or suggestions or did you mainly act to review suggestions the members made myers well i tried to walk a tight rope and i think i was honest and had integrity at least i always tried to be that way i didnt go around trying to push my own ideas but the republican members frequently would ask me what i thought and i would say what i thought when minor things came up i would sometimes try to push them for example like social security coverage of employee contributions to k plans which is a minor matter from a policy standpoint but this was something that was just opening up at that time and it was a big loophole so the commission did recommend that we require these contributions to count for social security even though they didnt for income tax purposes so maybe technical things like that i might push but i didnt try to push my own views i know a lot of times i was shown these various packages and asked what to do you think of this and i might say well technically it has this problem and it will cost this much and so on so as i say i tried to balance those things out q you have generously donated to the ssa history archives a set of your numbered memoranda from your work on the commission could you just explain what those memoranda were and what role they played in the commissions deliberations myers i developed this procedure numbered memoranda and they dealt with all sorts of issues for example one suggestion was that the cola instead of being based on the cpi would be based on the increase in wages minus say  percent by basing it on wages everything in the system would be based on wages and it would be more stable im not sure who developed that idea whether i developed it or who but i wrote things up like this for the commission to see various possibilities and in the same way i think there are memos in there on the retirement age and it included changes in mortality if age  is the right age in the s from the mortality standpoint what would be the right age today now this would lead you to the conclusion to raise the retirement age i wasnt indirectly trying to influence them but you try to bring these facts before the public and there were other memos that the commission hadthe more major ones i put in this series and for any advisory commission i would suggest that this is a good device its a very handy reference rather than just the date on the memo q as we look at these numbered memoranda there is a series of actuarial cost estimates provided by you and the professional staff the numbers are revised several times and the revisions get especially noticeable going into the fall of  as the members of the commission began to divide politically some people have pointed to the changes in the cost estimates as evidence that the staff was politically shading the estimates to correspond to the political agenda of the majority on the commission how do you respond to this allegation myers i would say categorically that this just isnt true if the estimates were changed it was because the actuaries believed they should be changed as they do for the trustees report i think i might add about these numbered memos before they went out the whole staff got to see them in other words the political appointees as well as the civil service people reviewed them so make sure not only that they were accurate but that they were not biased for or against any political point of view it was all done on a very cooperative basis q would you describe for us a little bit how the commission worked what was chairman greenspans role how did the members interact myers i think alan greenspan did a great job as chairman he was not a social security expert his own views of what the system ought to be did not guide him so much he wanted to fulfill the responsibility of the commission and make a viable system as the president and the congressional leaders wanted he ran the meetings on a very levelhanded basis and gave all people a chance at it in all the talks i had with him there was never any effort to do things in a political manner in the beginning there was a bit of conflict between the members as we might expect with such a varied membership some were very liberal some were very conservative some of the liberals not bob ball who knew better but some of the others said this whole crisis was just not truethat the president was just trying to destroy social security etc etc well these were not the facts of the matter and i well remember pat moynihan saying that everybody was entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts on that point i made a number of presentations of the issues of what the cost situation was and so forth and i think that after a little while of proceeding in this deliberative manner all the members of the commission being intelligent and fair people came around to the fact that there was a problem and something had to be done about it now what you do about the problemthere are different ways you could just raise taxes or you could just cut benefits or you could have a mixture both there were a little fireworks in the beginning with a couple of members later on everybody settled down and said that weve got a job to do and even though we appeared to be deadlocked in the fall of  it wasnt that this was being done for political reasons its just that the opinions were different q so you did deadlock in the fall of  and president reagan had to extend the life of the commission past its original deadline and the members had to make another push to get a consensus recommendation myers yes and in a recent issue of the congressional record senator moynihan talked about his role in this and senator doles role in this and bob ball and others were involved all of them played an important part to try to get the thing going again because there was that iceberg ahead and in  if nothing had been done the oasi trust fund would have been exhausted at that time you could make good estimates which i did and as i recall the august  checks could not be coveredthere would not have been enough money to send them out q looking at this from the outside there was considerable doubt that the commission would be able to succeed from your point of view inside the commission were you pessimistic at some point myers i was awfully pessimistic i thought this was probably the most important thing i was ever in on and i hated to see it go down in failure not that i took all the responsibility i was just one of the cogs in the wheel still it was there and there was much dismay and discouragement among the staff then the commission asked for more time and in the beginning of  as the story goes dole and moynihan got to talking on the senate floor and got the thing started again q what were you doing what was the staff doing during the period when the deliberations appeared to be deadlocked myers people still were trying to develop packages that would work some of the staff were not fulltime they were fulltime when needed some like virginia reno and tim kelley went back to ssa during this time oh you asked about the republicans on the staff and i forgot to mention the most important one who was nancy altman she was designated to be alan greenspans personal assistant and again she was a very capable person she worked in a very professional way q now the final consensus came out of a small negotiating group were features of that consensus a surprise to you in any way or were they things that had already been under discussion and you had estimated and so on myers oh yes it had all been discussed the exact package probably had never been put together in exactly that way but parts of it were here and there in other packages and so it was just a matter of putting it all together q lets talk about some of the provisions in that final consensus package one of the big things in there and that eventually became a part of the  amendments was a move from payasyougo financing to a partial reserve funding approach tell us about that myers maybe you noticed that i winced a little as you said that because its not correct but it has often been described in that way so i am not being critical of you in the  amendments the system was changed to be on a payasyougo basis the  amendments changed this to some extent by providing for the building up of a sizable reserve but not in the early years unfortunately in the mids and particularly in the s if everything had worked out it would have built up a very large fund so in practice the payasyougo result would have been there for the first  or  years but the underlying financing mechanism was to build up a reserve now over the long run it would have been exhausted but it would have built a large fund in the s and early s now what was done in  in essence was to continue this but to strengthen the early years so you werent going to have another financial crisis and it was also going to hopefully balance out over the long run unlike the  amendments ideally what would have happened if the estimates had been right the trust funds would build up a large fund of some  trillion and then at the end of the year period that would have gone down to maybe years fund so it was what i call temporary partial reserve financing which is a rollercoaster in some ways which is not a good idea and which i didnt think was a good idea at the time but there wasnt time to do anything about it what should have been done is not to have as big a tax increase in  and have tax increases in later years the whole air of crisis in early  was lets fix this system up for the next decade lets also say that we looked at the long run problem and on the average we handled it but on average isnt so good i mean its a lot better than nothing at least it was recognized unlike the  amendments the thought in my mind and i think in other peoples minds was there is going to be time lets fix this up in the future lets not have this big fund build up and then be used up lets have more sensible financing but there was also the attitude of lets not rock the boat now weve got a consensus lets take it and run the consensus fixes the shortrange and on the average it fixes the longrange and thats a pretty good step unfortunately in the early s when senator moynihan made an attempt to do this he didnt get anywhere because of budget limitations which i think were very artificial but the commission never really looked at the long range situation except wanting to be able to say we recognized it weve raised the retirement age to help solve this problem and so forth so in hindsight critics can say hey why didnt you guys do a more thorough job when a house is burning down you cant always take care of every problem that was the situation obviously in an ideal world we would have done a better job i would have done a better job but it would have been silly for me to get up before the commission in the closing days and say hey look guys sure you fixed up the shortrange sure you recognized the longrange problem but you didnt really thoroughly study the longrange problem they couldnt be bothered with that q do you recall whos idea that was who if anybody was pushing this financing approach myers it just developed it wasnt planned nobody said lets do it this way it was just the natural result of saying well fix up the longrange situation in  years on the average well fix it up and well do this in part by having a high tax rate beginning in  when you have a level tax rate and increasing benefit costs then averaging out higher benefits later youre bound to build up a fund and youre bound to use it up q as we look at it today some people rationalize the financing basis by saying that its a way of partially having the baby boomers pay for their own retirement in advance youre telling me now this was not the rationale nobody made that argument or adopted that rationale myers thats correct the statement you made is widely quoted it is widely used but it just isnt true it didnt happen that way it was mostly happenstance that the commission adopted this approach to financing social security the way they thought about it was that in order to achieve longrange balance we have to have this high tax rate in  instead of putting it in steps we could have fixed it up with a series of steps lower in  about the same in  higher in  that could have fixed it up just as easily but there wasnt time it was not intentional it has the effect of baby boomers paying for their own retirement which in a sense is good but it wasnt a controlling element and it was not talked about the main thing that was talked about was how do we fix up the shortrange problem are you sure we arent going to have another crisis in  or  years and can you say that we have looked at the longrange problem and have done something about it q in recent years you have argued that we should return to payasyou go financing myers and i still think so i still think we should have done that in  when senator moynihan was pushing it the reason i think so is that in an ideal world i wouldnt object to having a large fund and have the investment income helping pay the cost of the benefits like in a private pension plan but we dont live in an ideal world with a large fund theres the problem of how to invest it and the problem of using it to hide budget deficits and also another problem that i foresaw and which still might arise when we come to the year  and we start increasing the retirement age i envision people saying hey why are they making me wait a couple months or  months or  months to get full benefits when you have all that money in the fund so that would just destroy the planned financing i think its safer to have a fund balance of  percent which you need for business cycles and then you dont to have worry about how to invest it whats its effect on the economy it produces some investment income but not much its useful but it takes the focus away from the real issue of the benefit protection that is provided and gets people talking about how are we going to use all that moneyits stolen its worthless ious its not going into productive enterprise it hides the budget deficit and so on some of which is true some of which is not if you dont have a big fund you dont get into all that business q you mentioned the idea of raising the retirement age i take it that you supported this part of the commissions proposals myers i supported that idea long before it was done by the  amendments my view has long been that if you have a demographic problem you solve it by demographic means if people are living longer they should work longer many of the political liberals strongly opposed this they saw it as a backdoor way of cutting benefits but it really doesnt reduce lifetime benefits because theyre going to live longer then the argument was how do you know that just because people are going to live longer that they are going to work more you know its possible that the people who live longer will not be capable of working longer i think various studies have shown that peoples health has improved so they could keep working but its conceivable that people could live longer and not work my answer is if this occurs ill be one of the first to say dont raise the retirement age the countrys just going to have to pay more but put it in the law now give people advance notice then if it turns out that you shouldnt raise the retirement age you can easily change it nobodys going to object but if we had waited to take action until say  and then said that the retirement age is going to start increasing in  people would say this is unfair but as it was done theyve got  years advance notice so i was all in favor of doing it then while we are on this subject there is one quirk about raising the retirement age which you may have noticed and you may wonder why the age now goes up  months a year until it gets to  and then it stays there for about  years and then it goes up to  why whats the logic the answer is there is no logic the answer is that when the calculations were made to take it straight up to  it produced too much of a surplus in the longrange unfortunately the assumptions turned out such that it would have been good to do it that way in fact in  the age could easily have been raised to  eventually there were people who gave that idea support jake pickle had a bill in and he wanted it raised to  but apparently they didnt need to in order to obtain longrange balance this is most unfortunate but sometimes the actuarial estimates are too optimistic as they were then and sometimes theyre too pessimistic so its unfortunate we didnt go to  my present position considering the deficit is on the benefits side raise the age to  and go straight up until you get to  by  q or take out that pause myers and take out the pause right now a lot of people even some who are politically liberal when theyre trying to put together a package to solve this problem one of the things they do is take out that pause since it had no logic other then this was the result of actuarial estimates q how did you get age  myers its arbitrary its about the figure you need to get balance my proposal is very simple very traditionalpart benefits part taxes id raise the tax rate by  percent on employers and employees in steps of  percent each in  another  percent in   and  so you have a total of  percent each my argument is that out of increases in wages people usually can deal with this they wont notice it and also i would  as mentioned earlier raise the retirement age to  and this just about does the job q another thing that was introduced in the  amendments was taxation of social security benefits tell me what you thought about that and whether you think thats a good idea myers my own view has always been that it is proper to subject benefits to income taxation like any other retirement income take into account what people have contributed out of their aftertax income not what the employer put in because that was exempt from income taxation and tax it just like any other contributory pension what was done in  was just a step in that direction with the present  percent its pretty close to the proper theoretical basis i just thought that benefits should be subject to taxation just like anything else now a lot of objection to it was that low income people would be affected well they arent only  percent of the people would be affected by proper income taxation of benefitsand only  percent by the present provisions but the opponents made it seem like everybody including the poor are going to have to pay income tax which just wasnt the case but even if they had been taxed properly  percent of the people wouldnt pay anything the only point i had against it was i didnt like that the proceeds from the income taxation went back to the trust funds now i dearly love the trust funds but i dont think they deserve the money thats general revenue just like when a guy gets a pension from general motors and thats subject to income tax the general motors pension fund doesnt get the money back but it was like the saying about why willie sutton robbed banksbecause thats where the money was they needed money to get to balance in the program i said i didnt like this but i supported the whole package and since then i never said this ought to be repealed q so your view is that we should have taxed benefits anyway even if it were not needed as a revenueraiser in the commissions package myers yes benefits should have been subject to income tax from the beginning it was just a historical fluke that they werent but as far as the package i thought well i support the package im not going pick a piece out here that i dont like and try to get that changed not that i had any power to do that but i wouldnt advocate it when they raised the proportion subject to income tax in  to  percent and then the additional money went to the hi trust fund i opposed that some of that money ought to go to the general fund but dont break this bargain made in  to tax  percent of the benefits over the threshold q and did support for taxation of benefits breakdown along partisan lines or was it fairly evenly split myers it was fairly evenly split i would guess somebody like bob dole would not be strongly opposed to it because he recognized the logic of it other people who are more partisan in nature particularly claude pepper didnt like it at all q there was another change introduced in the  amendments it was the coverage of new federal employees under social security beginning in  and optional coverage for existing employees i know that the labor representative lane kirkland opposed that what was your view of that myers i think kirkland had to take that position to support his constituents i was strongly in favor i have always been in favor of universal coverage i was always embarrassed that i spoke in favor of social security at times while i was there and id make speeches and people would ask the embarrassing question if this is such great program why arent you in it and my answer honestly was i think i should be but that isnt the way the law is as a matter of fact despite my  years of government employment ive also had  years of social security coverage some of it simultaneous but most of it after i retired but i was always in favor of it and as i said i think it should have been done from the start by the way i think almost all of the members of the commission were in favor of covering federal employees and bob ball im certain supported it it was a matter of principle universal coverage but lane kirkland had to take that position because his federal unions were strongly opposed q another change that was introduced was this stabilizer provision if i understand correctly the idea is if the trust fund reserves get below a certain level relative to previous years then this provision would kick in and reduce the cola myers you have the right idea the cola would then be either the lesser of the wage increase or the price increase so that what happened in the early s when prices went up more than wages this would offset that and would be a sort of stabilizer and thats again described in one of the numbered memos i dont know who originated the idea maybe i did maybe i didnt sometimes its hard to say who originated a particular idea but to me its an ideal thing to do not necessarily to save the system but it sure will help in unusual economic times and i think its a fair thing to do the only thing that is wrong in present law is that the trigger point is too low when the trust fund gets that small it may be going down hill too fast i hope we never have this time in the country again when wages go up half as fast as prices but if we do it ought to kick in at much higher fund ratio and stop the system from going down hill q now we havent actually used this provision myers never been used because it kicks in when the trust fund is under a  percent fund ratio were at  percent now and an ideal is  or  percent and thats what it ought to be kept at but this is the only way it could be done it has never been used i cant see it being used but if it were set at a higher ratio it could be a help q were there any other policy changes in the commissions package that you think are important myers i think the other things are more minor the other thing that i think was quite good was the windfall elimination provision it stops people with pensions from noncovered employment from getting the advantages of the weighted benefit formula and that i thought was a good idea actually the way it was done it has one problem and it was partly my fault because i worked on this particularly with the staff of the ways and means committee the principle was very good and it works out fine for highpaid government employees like you and me but there are some cases where it works out very badly where a person has  or  years of social security employment and  or  years of government employmentit just makes too large a reduction as you know the maximum reduction in the benefit is  percent of the government pension thats an awfully big reduction for a low wage earner who has minimal social security and a minimal noncovered pension i have a couple of cases in my file of people in that situation ive been advocating that instead of  percent it should have been a  percent or  percent reduction if the maximum reduction were  percent that would still have that windfall taken away from high paid executives i have had this proposal out for awhile i tried to convince narfe to support it but they want the whole provision repealed i keep telling them look something is better then nothing youre not going to just get it repealed so try to help out some of these low income people but nobody wants to liberalize the system at all even when theres a great injustice q now about the procedures of the commission is there anything else that you want to talk about what happened after the consensus was arrived at in january of  can you just tell me how it ended  myers both sides got together and agreed on a compromise package and then the commission met one eveningi dont know the exact dateand  of the  members agreed to it the three that didnt agree seemed to be some of the politically very conservative people and they were not violently opposed but they just couldnt go along with some of the recommendations so  out of  is a pretty good majority and then they called the press in and i had the privilege of explaining the package to the press the place was just jammed it was a relatively small house but that was a most interesting session that was it q you showed me when i came in this morning your memento from the party you had tell me that story myers as you know our offices were in a very elegant townhouse on lafayette square in fact this particular house at a certain point in history was the white house theodore roosevelt i think it was lived there for a while when the white house was being refurnished this was a very elegant house with high ceilings crystal chandeliershardly suited for an office building but we had desks all over the place i was on the second floor and alan greenspan since he didnt come in very much said he would take an office on the rd floor so i didnt have to walk up three flights all the time so we managed to operate with reasonable efficiency when the work of the commission was done my wife rudy and i thought it would be nice to have a party to celebrate the successful completion of the work of the commission it hadnt been enacted by the congress but apparently unlike many commission reports it was going to be acted on so we decided to have a catered party which for the record did not come out of any government funds although we did use government facilities we checked to see if this was proper and it was we invited all the members of the commission all the staff and the commissioner of social security and a few people like that and we just had a very nice party not all members of the commission came because some were out of town but a number of them did come and the members of the commission i dont know who instigated it very kindly got together and bought me this crystal of the sword of excalibur and gave it to me saying i had accomplished the impossible by withdrawing the sword and getting the commission to agree this was generous i was a help but i wasnt the guy who did it no one person did it so naturally it is a very pleasant memento which we treasure q give me your overall assessment of the greenspan commission myers i am very happy with it i feel very pleased about it i have gotten an awful lot of credit for it far more then i deserve i played a role but many other people played a role bob ball senator moynihan barber conable robert beck from prudential and people from the white house and i think the results were great they werent perfect as i indicated nothing could ever be done that everybody would think was perfect but it sure has worked quite well the system from a cash flow standpoint is in good shape solutions are possible in the future and the commission gave me a lot of satisfaction many people point to the commission as an example of how commissions can and should operate but again it was fortunate that people got together as they ought to do nowadays and compromised their differences you cant have everything you want in this world q alright i just want to ask you about a couple of current issues and get your impression and well be close to the end here myers ok q as im sure you know theres a social security advisory council thats about to issue its report and according to the stories that are in the press for the first time in history they are going to propose privatization of the programpartial privatization will be one of the proposals i want to get your views about the recommendations of the advisory council and what you think about those three plans myers from what i know about the proposals id start off saying that to me the translation of the word privatization is destroyed if it wont do it immediately it will do it inevitably so therefore im opposed basically now as to the three plans there are some parts of each of the plans that i like but theres no plan that i am loudly in favor of i suppose if i had to choose one it would be the one which bob ball is supporting the thing i dont like about that one is i dont like building up large assets and investing  of them in the stock market i just think that the social security system is so big an economic impact it should be economically neutral im a strong advocate as you probably know of payasyougo financing and if you have payasyougo financing and if you have a fund of the present size or even a little smaller it really doesnt make much difference what you invest it in then if you get more investment return thats not a big deal but if as in bob balls proposal youd build up a huge fund then the investment income would be significant in financing the program and i just dont think thats they way to go however if you invest even more of the fund in the stock market youd be committing a cardinal investment sin by buying when the markets high and selling when the markets low because when youre in a depression theres less payroll tax coming in and you have to use some of the fund so youd be selling the stocks when the market was low and when times are good youd be buying when the market is high now if only  is in equities maybe youd never touch the  but i just think that building up a big fund is a dangerous thing politically you can sanitize it now and say its all in indexed funds etc but another administration can come in and say lets use the money for social investment now im not against doing social good but i dont think its up to the social security system to do it the congress should decide those things q now in your view we have this problem now because of the funding changes that were introduced in the  amendments right myers which was not intentional and we shouldnt have had it we should have had payasyougo financing but the way that i thought it would happen is for about  years it wouldnt make any difference but i had hoped that in the s things would change over to payasyougo financing the way pat moynihan recommended i worked with him on that but it didnt fly because it seems to unbalance the budget whereas it really doesnt but it seems to i just dont believe in building up a big fund then if this were done i dont believe in putting it in the stock market i cant believe that the supporters of this approach really think this is such a great idea other than it will help them finance the system better or in other words fewer benefit cuts might be necessary my way of solving the problem is to raise the retirement age more than it is at present again gradually and deferred also higher tax ratesthose bad words nonetheless higher tax rates deferred and gradual can be sustainable of course bob ball has a higher tax rate ultimately but id have it a little sooner the other two proposals i think are very bad because oil and water dont mix im all in favor of private sector investments middle income people even some lower income people and certainly higher income people should be building on top of social security social security never was intended to do the whole job it shouldnt and it would be bad if it did again thats the reason i quit in  what i called the expansionists were out to expand the program they did expand it some in the early s but their intentions were to expand it much more so that it would take care of all the economic needs of  percent of the population and i didnt think that would be good for the character of the country people should do something for themselves on top of this basic floor by the same token i dont think this basic floor should be destroyed by people opting out or privatizing out of it leave it alone fix the system up encourage private savings any way you want to id even go for a compulsory ira system where everybody had to contribute  or  or  percent of pay and put it into mutual funds or whatever but leave social security alone as the base thats my thesis and so i dont like either of these proposals what i particularly dont like isnt brought out muchthat theyre dead from the start they cant be enacted because the other two proposals bob balls as well will unbalance the budget create huge budget deficits and yet we have the president and the congress saying theyre going to balance the budget in  years and partly the reason theyre balancing it is because social security is hiding the deficit which i have often objected to but anyhow its a fact of life this is the way theyre measuring it and if the president and congress agree to balance the budget through some plan or other i dont know what it is or what it could be but say they did and then you enacted any of these advisory council proposals it would throw the whole budget out of balance and so it just wont work the trouble with all of this publicity now is that it causes people to say something is wrong with social security and the principal effect is that it is further destroying confidence in the system q thats what i wanted to ask you about that is my last question what do you see as the future of the program given that there is such a low level of confidence in the program now how should we cope with that and what do you see as the future of the program myers what i would do but im not president or emperor yet would be to fix the system up the way i said and then get out and sell it to the public and try to convince the public that government estimates are not biased there were many people back in  and  who said the systems going to have another crisis in the next few yearsyou cant believe the government estimates we will have a crisis every few years we havent had any crisis the systems better financed now the fund balance is  billion more than we estimated in  theres the longrange problem however the assumptions were a little too optimistic and the disability experience turned sour the longrange picture is not in balance the way it was set in  but the sortrange problem was certainly solved by the  amendments you cant argue with that the ssa should get out and convince the public that we have all this money here weve got the situation under control to the best of our knowledge although there very likely is a longrange problem as president reagan said if things go wrong in the future people of good will get together and they can solve it youre familiar of course with reagans statement on signing the  amendments which is a masterpiece i use it all the time particularly when im talking to conservative groups who are bent on destroying the system i say look what reagan said i dont know if he really felt that way or not but hes on the record whoever wrote that speech did a masterpiece thats what i would do fix the present system up if you want more private savings this isnt really my area im not too sure that we have too little savings in this country but some people act as though if we put a lot of money into the private sector this will spur all kinds of new investments i cant see why thats going to happen you put huge sums into the stock market it will just drive the stock prices up then also whos going to buy the government bonds which the trust funds are buying nobody talks about that i never liked the fact that the excess of income over outgo in the trust funds is used to mask the budget deficit ive written about that but thats the way theyre counting it and thats the way theyre going to balance the budget partly on the back of social security but if you do these advisory council things you tear that all down so what will happen is if they ever really consider these things when they got up to that point of the budgetary effect theyd draw back in horror and say we cant do this so all youve done is stir the public up that the systems no good and ought to be revamped or eliminated and yet youre not going to do it one other thing id like to talk aboutwhich i have just written a piece onis moneys worth there are many people who complain about not getting their moneys worth out of the system especially younger workers and its becoming increasingly that way and that old geezers like me get far more than their moneys worth therefore it is argued you ought to do means testing of the benefits i am utterly opposed to means testing means testing is bad because it is degrading its administratively costly it creates fraud and abuse and it discourages savings if you means test the benefits even if you do it right and then the middle income person says youre going to take away part of my benefits if i have savings i dont trust you politicians anyhow you say part now but when i reach retirement age youre going to take it all away so why should i have any savings why should i have a small pension from my employer the people who are millionaires wont be affected of course the average guy who earns  a year is going to have all these disadvantages to save now back to moneys worth thats just the nature of any definedbenefit pension plan like social security that the persons retiring in the early years get more than their moneys worth and that this moneys worth goes down and down otherwise had social security been on a moneys worth basis the benefits in the early decades wouldnt have been effective because the benefits would have been so small also if you had a level tax rate instead of an increasing one you would have this problem that i see of too much money in the trust funds so what we did i think was right were not on a payasyougo basis but weve been near it and in the next  years were going to build up too much money as to moneys worth analyses even though bruce schobel and i did itand the reason we did it was basically not because we thought that this was such a great concept but because if it was going to be done we wanted to do it right its an actuarial matter some of my friends the economists have done it and they hadnt done it right so we said if it was going to be done lets do it right so in moneys worth you get into this argument does the employer share belong to the employee people who dont like the program say yes and that makes the moneys worth look terrible others like me who like the program say if youre going to do it look at just the employees share if you do that it doesnt come out too bad but even then the very highpaid younger people dont make out but my answer to all that is so what this is not supposed to be a moneys worth program its not supposed to be an individual equity programno more than say school taxes its much less than school taxes because school taxes if you never get married youre never getting anywhere near your moneys worth or if youre done having kids you cant say im not going to pay any more school taxes or like many private benefit plans definedbenefit pension plans the same thing happens or under health benefit plansif the employer pays  percent of payroll for health benefits that doesnt mean that each employee gets health benefits worth  percent q its the nature of insurance right myers yes its a broad pooling of the risk and the advocates of the moneys worth principle dont want a broad pooling of the risk they say yes we will pool but they want people with identical characteristics theyre willing to take into account the probability of death but they say lets just take all young peopleand theyll maybe even take into account the probability of being married or not married but they wont take into account the probability of being a low income or a high income person all of your life you may start out high and end up low anyway its broad pooling as i see it moneys worth just is not a prime consideration and shouldnt be given prime consideration if you enter into the debate on these grounds youve lost before you start because it was known from the beginningany actuary could have said it in that this was going to happen this is not due to any devious planning on the part of the greedy old geezersthis is the inevitable course of a plan thats going to provide reasonably adequate benefits regardless of length of coverage in my case i get social security benefits because ive had over  years of coverage and my basic benefits are a great actuarial bargain but each year the reverse happens as to the earnings that i made last year for my consulting workand paid the selfemployment tax onand even if i just look at the employee tax and not the extra part i pay as selfemployed that i paid last yearas to the additional benefits im getting even though theyre relatively large because im before the notch babies the actuarial value of that isnt as much as the taxes i paid so moneys worth is an interesting concept but its not significant or all pervasive q ive always thought that the reason that people get so confused around moneys worth is because they fail to appreciate that this is after all an insurance program and that it operates on insurance principles to some degree myers again yes but you have to use the word insurance right because many people use the word insurance as individual insurance that has individual equity in it if you look at insurance as i would very very broadly spreading the risk in society then its fine but many people consider insurance like individual insurancetwo persons  years old go into an insurance company and buy a policy and they pay the same premium if youre  you pay a different premium but in social security theres a much broader spreading of the risk we should just downplay this moneys worth thing and say  its interestingit does show that you get some individual equity in it but dont expect this to be the guiding principle of the system i just sent joan wainwright a letter in regards to an informational pamphlet which has just been issued and theyre generally excellent but it contains statements that impel people to think that the money theyre getting comes from what they and their employer paid and that in the long run is counterproductive publicity q so are you optimistic about the future of the program considering the assault that it is under these days myers some days yes and some days no historical links
