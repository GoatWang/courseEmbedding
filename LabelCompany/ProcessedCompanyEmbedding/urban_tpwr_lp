with modis and appeears author lp daac date june   image of annual mean accumulated growing degreedays agdd for  agdd is calculated from the modisaqua and modisterra  meter day composites of daytime and nighttime land surface temperature lst five of the eleven study sites from krehbiel and henebry  are labeled in this image areas with higher mean annual agdd are shaded red including major cities such as minneapolisst paul mn and chicago il agdd data provided courtesy of the author june st marks the summer solstice ushering in the arrival of summer and generally warmer temperatures the  million urban dwellers in the us will feel the heat of summer even more so than their rural counterparts why because of the urban heat island uhi effect or the general phenomenon of higher temperatures in urban areas versus the surrounding countryside uhis are generally measured by urbanrural air temperature differences whereas land surface temperatures lst often captured by satellite sensors measure the surface urban heat island suhi the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is a sensor aboard the terra and aqua satellites that provides daily global lst observations air temperature observations from weather stations in and around cities provide longspanning records of urban temperatures at a specific location but they suffer from poor spatial coverage throughout cities in contrast modis lst data products provide total coverage of urban and surrounding rural regions but at a lower spatial resolution of  meters a recent study by krehbiel and henebry  used day composites of daytime and nighttime lst from modisaqua myda and modisterra moda from  to  to calculate growing degreedays and accumulated growing degreedays to characterize the suhi for eleven urban areas in the midwest  they compared the modis lstbased results with corresponding air temperaturebased uhi characterization from  weather station data from the global historical climate network ghcn and  modeled gridded daymet temperature data the study compared daytime vs nighttime urban vs rural and seasonal dynamics of the suhi   the modis lstderived results were closer to the ghcn air temperaturederived results than the daymet modeled air temperature results for the nighttime observations this suggests that modis lst could be used for monitoring nighttime uhi dynamics for cities in the midlatitudes seasonally the study found more pronounced urbanrural differences in thermal time during the summer months once the surrounding rural vegetation canopy developed understanding the thermal climate of cities is important because urban areas impact daily seasonal and annual weather on local to regional scales the lp daac’s application for extracting and exploring analysis ready samples appeears is a data extraction tool that can be used to visualize urban vs rural and daytime vs nighttime differences in the suhi effect below are the results from inputting the eleven urban and corresponding rural  total point locations used in krehbiel and henebry  into appeears for the same time period  for moda and myda daytime lst the boxplots labeled “sites” show differences in the median lst between the eleven urban sites and eleven rural sites appeears also allows the user to select a subset of their results as seen below nd plot bottom for the minneapolisst paul mn urbanrural site pair in minneapolisst paul the median urban modisaqua daytime lst was  k  °c  °f compared to the median rural lst which was  k  °c  °f the visualizations generated by appeears provide a quick and easy way to begin exploring suhi characteristics for any city across the world using modis lst data example of using appeears to compare categories above by city for all modisaqua myda daytime land surface temperature lst observations from  for the study sites from krehbiel and henebry  below appeears compares median decadal lst split between all urban and rural sites both y axes are in kelvin appeears also allows the user to select a subset of the results to adjust the focus of their research as needed in this example only the minneapolisst paul msp urban and rural sites are being compared
