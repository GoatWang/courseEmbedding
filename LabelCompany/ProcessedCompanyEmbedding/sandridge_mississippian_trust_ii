commodity investment didnt pan out jim royal tmfroyal mar   at pm oscar wilde once said that experience is the name we give to our mistakes my investment in sandridge mississippian trust ii nysesdr has been the greatest experience of my special situations portfolio but in investing as in life to be successful you must make the next right decision rather than foolishly holding to a past commitment that has been proven wrong so ive decided to sell my shares in this troubled royalty trust and move on to find a good investment ive got a good one here ouch that hurts this investment has been painful mitigated only by the relatively small stake i took and the ongoing stream of distributions i purchased shortly after the ipo at  per share it was all downhill from there after thursdays close the stock is down to  or about  the only salve is the cash distributions totaling  the overall return comes to  bad work if you can get it its the second year in a row that the trust has recorded a significant downward revision in reserves increasingly the trust is relying on selling natural gas and liquids as opposed to oil as previously indicated in the prospectus that is lowering royalties which hurts cash distributions over time foolish takeaway with little reason to expect things to change now im selling sandridge mississippian trust ii and will move the proceeds into other
