be an acceptable servicer due to its extensive track record as the largest servicer of ffelp loans criteria variation under the counterparty criteria for structured finance and covered bonds dated sept   fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterpartys creditworthiness the definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by fitch which represents a criteria variation since the only available funds to invest are those held in the collection account and the funds can only be invested for a short duration given the payment frequency of the notes fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned rating sensitivities aaasf rated tranches of most ffelp securitizations will likely move in tandem with the us sovereign rating given the strong linkage to the us sovereign by nature of the reinsurance and sap provided by ed sovereign risks are not addressed in fitchs sensitivity analysis fitch conducted a ce sensitivity analysis by stressing both the related lifetime default rate and basis spread assumptions in addition fitch conducted a maturity sensitivity analysis by running different assumptions for the ibr usage and prepayment rate the results below should only be considered as one potential model implied outcome as the

covered bonds dated sept   fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterpartys creditworthiness the definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by fitch which represents a criteria variation since the only available funds to invest are those held in the collection account and the funds can only be invested for a short duration given the payment frequency of the notes fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assignedrating sensitivitiesaaasf rated
