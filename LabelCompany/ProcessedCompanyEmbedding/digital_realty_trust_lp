or from the websites or ir departments of either digital realty or dupont fabros and now id like to turn the call over to bill stein bill stein thank you john good morning and thank you all for joining us lets begin here on page  of our presentation our customers and the desire to better serve them through more offerings in more locations are the key reason and the primary strategic rationale for doing this deal this transaction is consistent with our strategy of offering a comprehensive set of data center solutions from single cabinet colocation and interconnection all the way up to multimegawatt deployments at the far end of the spectrum this combination significantly expands our hyperscale product offering and enhances our ability to meet the rapidly growing needs of the leading cloud service providers this deal is also consistent with our stated investment criteria shown here on page  the transaction expands our presence in the most strategic us data center metro areas and the two portfolios are highly complementary the transaction is expected to be roughly  accretive to core ffo per share in  and roughly  accretive to  affo per share finally the combination continues to enhance the overall strength of the balance sheet lets turn to the key terms on page  the transaction is structured as a  stockforstock transaction each share of dft would be exchanged for  shares of dlr common stock upon completion of the transaction digital realty shareholders are expected to own  and dupont fabros shareholders approximately  of the combined company we expect to maintain the current dlr common stock dividend of  per share on an annual basis the board will be comprised of the  current digital realty directors along with  directors from dupont fabros the total transaction value is approximately  billion including  billion of common equity  million of preferred equity and  billion of assumed debt not including transaction cost we expect to permanently refinance the debt assumed in this transaction with a combination of investmentgrade corporate bonds and other financings we expect to realize approximately  million of annualized overhead synergies and the transaction is subject to approval by both sets of shareholders dupont fabros owns a highquality portfolio of purposebuilt data centers as you can see from the profile on page  and as evidenced by the  occupancy on the inservice portfolio the portfolio is comprised of just  inservice properties which should make for seamless integration dupont fabros portfolio is concentrated in top us data center metro areas across northern virginia chicago and silicon valley as shown here on page  digital realty has an existing presence in each of these metropolitan areas and we believe the two portfolios are highly complementary the merger will benefit digital realty by bolstering its presence in these toptier metro areas while dupont fabros will realize significant benefits of diversification from the combination with digital realtys existing footprint in  properties across  global metropolitan areas both companies have traditionally pursued similar campus strategies in major data center metros as you can see from the clusters on the aerial maps here on page  these campus environments enable both companies to achieve operational efficiencies and we expect the combined portfolio should benefit from additional economies of scale given the complementary campus footprints perhaps even more importantly however the ability to offer more than one campus environment within a single metro area will enable the combined company to compete for multiple availability zones within the same metropolitan area particularly from cloud service providers who may have certain distance requirements between deployments in a given metro area we envision the combined organization really will be the home to the cloud as demonstrated on page  the cloud and cloudlike customers represent a very significant proportion of dupont fabros rent roll which will further expand digital realtys cloud concentration we believe that we are still in the early innings of cloud adoption and supporting the explosive growth of this customer base will represent a tremendous opportunity over the next several years the credit quality of dupont fabros cloud and cloudlike customer base is exceptional and will further enhance the credit quality of digital realtys existing customer base from the perspective of dft shareholders however the transaction also significantly reduces customer concentration as shown on page  the combined companys top three customers will represent  of revenue compared to  for dupont fabros on a standalone basis moving on to market cap on page  the combined organization will be the eighth largest reit in the index with a total enterprise value of more than  billion and more than five times the size of the next largest data center reit the benefits of this scale translate directly to operating efficiencies as shown on page  dupont fabros has always run one of the tightest ships in the business and given the additional economies of scale achieved through the transaction the combined organization will have by far the most efficient cost structure and the highest ebitda margin in the data center sector dupont fabros is also unique in the data center sector in that it owns the dirt under all of its data centers the combined organization will likewise own the greatest percentage of real estate within the sector in addition to the inservice portfolio dupont fabros has six development projects currently underway as well as significant capacity and land held for future development as shown here on page  these six active development projects are  preleased and represent a total expected investment of approximately  million they are also located in metro areas where digital realty has an existing presence they are expected to be delivered over the next  months representing a solid pipeline of future growth potential turning to the balance sheet on page  the combined company will have an equity market cap of approximately  billion and a total enterprise value of  billion the balance sheet impact will be leveraged neutral but given the exceptional credit quality of the customer base and the longterm leases and the high proportion of owned real estate we would expect the combined companys unsecured debt profile should improve due to a broader investor base and greater liquidity that should over time result in an even lower cost of capital turning to page  as mentioned  directors from dupont fabros will be joining the  current digital realty directors by way of quick reminder on our board composition we maintain a destaggered board the majority of our directors compensation is paid in equity each of our directors maintains a sizable investment in the company the board and senior management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements and finally since  the substantial majority of managements longterm incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder return in closing were very excited to share with you today the announcement of this strategic transaction which will enhance our ability to serve our customers and hyperscale cloud customers in particular in the top data center metro areas across the us it will be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow and strengthens our balance sheet the complementary nature of the two footprints customer bases and product offerings provide mirror image diversification and enhancement benefits and enhance our ability to create significant longterm value for both sets of shareholders now wed be pleased to take your questions denise would you please begin the qa session questions and answers operator i would be happy to sir we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions jordan sadler of keybanc capital markets jordan sadler good morning and congratulations so my question relates to strategy and the strategic fit here you have not been competing as readily for the larger csp deals over the course of the last  months dupont obviously has and theyve signed quite a bit of these deals and i think the focus had been that the returns on these deals was a little bit maybe at the skinnier end of where you wanted to be can you talk about what you view as a vision going forward will this be a bigger area of competition for you or a bigger area of your strategic objective scott peterson yes hi jordan scott here i think first off i think pursuing the cloud providers in their deployments has always been a key part of our strategy as a general statement we believe this merger is consistent with our overall strategy of being a full spectrum space power and connectivity provider to our customers in core markets on a global scale admittedly weve focused most of our ma activity on colocation and connectivity this expands our presence of highquality scale data centers in key core markets in the us which is predominantly as you pointed out lease to hyperscale and cloud providers we believe these assets will benefit greatly from our connectivity strategy via the service exchange which ultimately enhances this full spectrum space power and connectivity offering to the cloud providers and their customers through the customers and partners of digital realty andy power ill just add to that jordan i mean a trend i think weve seen coming is theres been on the customer side a consolidation of the buying groups from the smallest footprints network nodes up to the multimegawatt hyperscales into one group on their side so being able to deliver the full product suite to those decision makers be it these large cloud and other digital economy names we think really differentiates us bill stein and thats in a single conversation with the buyer jordan sadler right right and then as a followup the accretion you outlined obviously you mentioned the synergy of  million but im curious is there anything else thats sort of driving the  i guess whats the basis for the  affo per share accretion estimate that you outlined andy power sure jordan so the expense synergies are  let me just take a step back roughly  ffo and roughly  affo accretive to  the components of the  our expense synergies are roughly a percentage of that then you have some financing cost synergies well be replacing that are highyield cap structure with our investmentgrade cap structure so theres interest expense savings and then the last is  so thats roughly about  and then the last percent is roughly due to the relative valuation in terms of the exchange ratio of exchanging their equity for our equity operator paul morgan of canaccord genuity paul morgan congratulations just in following up on the accretion estimates that you just gave i mean is that  number i mean do you expect kind of the full realization of the ga synergies for one and i guess the financing cost as well to be embedded in that  number or kind of is the stabilized synergy accretion higher than that andy power so paul we see the timeline playing out from here we obviously need to both put a proxy on file and solicit the vote of our shareholders so thatll take a month or so then we envision closing in the back half of  and we would expect both the financing synergies because wed obviously have to put the new bonds in place to close on the transaction although we do have a bridge as a backup facility but we do expect the financing and expense synergies to be fully in place for full year  paul morgan okay great and then just you mentioned a few of the kind of opportunities on the revenue side and is there anything you kind of would mention as sort of most compelling there from a revenue synergy perspective whether it be what you mentioned in terms of multiple availability zones for the cloud providers or crossselling sort of exchange et cetera into their portfolio and is any of that contemplated in how you think about  doesnt sound like it  but maybe how you think about being able to quantify that in terms of the impact as you look forward scott peterson yes paul hi its scott i think youre right as we mentioned earlier i think these assets will benefit greatly from our connectivity strategy which will allow the cloud providers and the customers to the cloud to connect and create ecosystems going forward i think also if you look at the development pipeline its pretty substantial and in addition to that theres vacant land that comes with it that well be able to generate future revenue from operator richard choe of jp morgan richard choe can you talk a little bit about potential revenue synergies it seemed like dupont was kind of going full tilt but maybe they will benefit from some of your i guess inventory thats available and then also can you talk a little bit about is there still a focus on colocation or are you seeing more cloud demand in the pipeline and thats the reason for this deal is kind of shifting back a little bit to that hyperscale cloud demand andy power just to reiterate a little bit of what scott says i think theres multiple components of this so you have an active development pipeline of close to  megawatts at roughly  preleased thats going to be really delivering and kicking in late  early  you have a longerterm pipeline of close to  megawatts in multiple core markets where we are today thatll be inaudible receipts for growth i think both of those and the existing inplace customers present an opportunity where quite honestly we have a broader customer base a broader sales force and a broader global organization to sell into that space so i think the combined company has a better opportunity to maximize revenue opportunity be it colocation or large footprint up to multiple megawatt hyperscale scott peterson yes and second part of that richard is this in no way would indicate a shift in our strategy away from colo and connectivity this is merely an outgrowth of an execution of that same comprehensive strategy of being a full spectrum space power and connectivity provider in core markets on a global scale so this is really complementary to that existing strategy were excited about what was the telx which is now all digital and the equicity assets that are part of our overall company and growing those platforms and expanding our presence and our activity of that in the colocation market richard choe great thank you operator jonathan atkin of rbc capital markets mr atkin your line is open mr atkin your line is open please go ahead the next question will come from john petersen of jefferies john petersen just kind of curious on obviously dft has really strong relationships with some customers that you dont have and then the other way around now i know at dft in the past a lot of the leases were signed kind of by the executives so im kind of curious what your thoughts are on maintaining relationships with companies like facebook and microsoft and ensuring that they stay part of the portfolio under a combined company bill stein no i mean we obviously have a fair amount of business with both those companies and we have relationships throughout the organizations their organizations and our organizations at multiple levels so i would expect that that would absolutely continue in fact some of those conversations have already occurred about this deal and the reception has been quite positive john petersen okay good to know and im just kind of curious on the timing i imagine this probably isnt the first time youve had an opportunity to do a deal like this with dft just kind of curious if you guys could reiterate kind of why now and why not at points in the past scott peterson yes john honestly you think about this is something that we probably had conversations on for several years i can tell you that a few years ago our focus was executing on the colocation and connectivity side that was the important part of our strategy that we felt that we were missing and so we really put all of our attention on executing there and as you can see via telx and the equicity portfolio how weve executed there and fundamentally changed the direction of the firm to a more full spectrum space power connectivity company and then also kind of more pointedly in the past the economics werent as attractive as they are today everybody will remember theres a fair amount of rolldown exposure that was concerning people and clearly the management team there has done an excellent job of working through that and a much more stabilized company with great prospects for growth operator colby synesael of cowen and company colby synesael two questions when i think about the various product sets ill describe them as super wholesale which are some of the plus megawatt deals weve been seeing dupont signing of late traditional wholesale which andy when i met with you earlier this week you describe as i think up to  megawatts in terms of what the sweet spot is for digital and then obviously with the telx portfolio you guys have an interconnectretail solution set what was it about the super wholesale that you guys werent able to do on your own that you werent competing or participating in that more aggressively was it you didnt have the relationships for that particular solution or was it that you didnt have the right product set so im trying to get a better sense of what you get by acquiring dupont opposed to doing this on your own and then secondly dupont was in the market or had said it would be in a market to do about a  million equity raise to support the capex requirements for these large buildouts that are ongoing right now i appreciate that this is an equity offer the way youre structuring deal but  or excuse me  its a stock deal but do you anticipate having to go to the equity markets for some form of capital to finance the capex requirements that youre inheriting from dupont thank you scott peterson hi colby scott thanks for the question i think weve always been successful in the super wholesale side of the business its just our portfolio is so large and diverse it maybe gets lost in the numbers but its also a question of how you look at it this is an affirmation of when you land a customer particularly like some of these cloud providers how they will expand and grow so if you look at our portfolio we do a high percentage of our leasing or signings with existing customers and if you look at the dupont portfolio youll see that a lot of these large customers started off and have continued to expand there and showed some of the importance of landing them at the beginning and then continuing to have them grow and expand within your platform andy power and colby to address your second question obviously duponts not going to be doing a standalone equity offering theyll be funding their needs with likely their revolving credit facility we look at the deal today essentially leverage neutral keeps our credit stats right around our five times net debt to ebitda just a touch below that and i would say actually thats with a significant amount of  were absorbing a significant amount of latent ebitda capacity given the amount of development thats coming online from dupont we will on a combined company basis evaluate our capital needs for  later in this year and nothings changed in terms of our financing strategy so continue to target roughly around five times debt to ebitda and fixed charge coverage north of three and if those combined capital needs require some form of nondebt capital we will evaluate all of our options from public and private equity to perpetual fur equity and we also have asset noncore asset sales as a source as well operator michael bilerman of citi michael bilerman good morning mike rollins is here with me too i was wondering if you can talk a little bit about sort of the immediate process of putting the two companies together and i think scott you referenced youve had conversations over the years but in terms of consummating this transaction sort of when did the serious discussion start leading into todays announcement scott peterson the second half of that is there were a couple casual conversations call it say  days ago that warmed up and it really got very serious in say the last  days on that from an integration standpoint i think were viewing this as being a somewhat seamless integration were obviously in all of these markets we know the buildings the physical structures we know the customers we know the operations so we view that as being a fairly straightforward process obviously theres backoffice administrative integration that needs to be executed but from a customerfacing operational standpoint i think were viewing this as being pretty straightforward from an integration standpoint michael bilerman and then how much of a competitive process was it over the last  to  days at what point were you exclusive in these negotiations versus other parties scott peterson we had an exclusivity agreement in place over the last several weeks operator frank louthan of raymond james frank louthan just talk to some of the potential merger issues here obviously the environments better for ma but any thoughts on potential issues with and divestitures in any of the markets and just as a followup how attractive are the portland and toronto markets to you that dupont was expanding in talk to us about how you can exploit those opportunities scott peterson yes the first part of the question is we did a very thorough underwriting analysis on all the aspects of the transaction and really dont want to get into every specific issue as related to the underwriting other than to say that we were very thorough and we feel comfortable where weve come out in all that and wouldnt want to speculate on any hypothetical situations going forward as it relates to portland and toronto i think were very happy to get land in portland which is more of a buildtosuit market so to have control of a site that we can pitch to customers i think is very helpful to us toronto is a market that we are in but we are out of inventory and have considered expansion there for a while and the demand there has been somewhat good and were excited about the opportunity to lease up that inprocess development project there and expand it in the future bill stein i would just add on frank that we in toronto specifically weve had inbound inquiry from top digital customers asking us to expand so this lines up very well scott peterson yes and torontos you may or may not know its a tight market from a site perspective so its not particularly easy to execute there so this is actually going to be very helpful from a timing perspective operator matthew heinz of stifel matthew heinz how do you think the combined scale of the organization kind of impacts your negotiating leverage with larger customers clearly thats a focus a strategic focus in this deal and particularly with respect to one large upcoming customer renewal that dupont had been publicly kind of the working through right now scott peterson yes these are all very competitive markets so i think we always have to be marketoriented and marketfocused on that and we want to be good partners to our customers clearly we have a relationship so you have conversations and you might have better visibility as to when opportunities are coming up but when it comes to a competitive situation i think were going to always have to be marketoriented on that bill stein matt i would just add as an echo to i think in response to the first question were seeing the buying groups of these customers consolidating at the decisionmaker level so we view anything we can do to be more relevant and important to these customers across all the major us markets the four continents we operate from a small footprint to the multiple megawatts just differentiates ourselves and allows us go deeper and broader with the top customers matthew heinz okay thanks and just can you talk about sort of the strategic opportunities behind combining the hyperscale workloads with your interconnection business i think you mentioned that earlier what kind of strategic role are these workloads taking on as it pertains to interconnection and how customers want to interact with those workloads on your sites and then just kind of to tag onto that in the long run what gives you the confidence that these guys are going to be all sticking around because its certainly been a fear for investors scott peterson from a workload standpoint we see as the cloud evolves and as software as a service evolves the execution of the hybrid multicloud strategies by our customers will become more and more important to them and so having better access and connectivity to the cloud providers will be more important to them strategically being able to facilitate that connectivity and do it in a way that lowers latency and adds better security will be of great value to both the cloud providers and their customers which are ultimately our customers bill stein and i think it speaks to the confidence that these customers are likely to be in our combined companys portfolio for the long run is the fact that they continue to grow on these campuses theyve been growing on the digital campuses where we service many of these customers and theyve been growing on me dupont campuses at the same time and theyve been doing that in large quantums of space and power and theyve been contracting for long durations of leases operator craig robbins of nisa investment advisors craig robbins i just had a question on recent acquisitions like telx you guys have kind of taken your time to fully integrate the acquisition before you looked for future targets is that the expectation going forward and then i just had a quick followup scott peterson yes i would say this acquisition this quite unique in that it is incredibly overlapping in our core major markets primarily ashburn chicago and silicon valley given what the company was it is i would say peoplelight relative to the size of the company were talking low one hundreds of people from an integration standpoint its also fairly straightforward in terms of contractual cash flows in terms of integrating with our systems so this is a transaction that i would say is on the easier side and closer to more of a seamless transaction or integration than our previous integrations and i would also say having gone through the last two acquisition and integrations i think weve learned more and more from each of those transactions have gotten better each time craig robbins got you thank you and then on its been a while but you finally just gotten some positive ratings momentum a positive outlook at sp and so i mean if you look at your top  peers here in the reit space now most of them are either high bbb or a i mean do you see this accelerating that momentum stalling it and just any color you had with rating agencies around this transaction and whether you have a high bbb or a target now to help with financing costs andy power so i would say the balance sheet strategy is not changing were still targeting that roughly five times debt to ebitda and the fixed charge coverage north of three mentioned but its not lost on us that we were about  billion when we got the bbb ratings in  and pro forma for this transaction were north of  billion enterprise value with what we view a bluechip high credit quality customer base thats very diversified and almost fully on a covered balance sheet so were not doing anything from a financial strategy thats going to drive the upgrade but we definitely have our fingers crossed that it may be coming operator robert gutman of guggenheim securities robert gutman congratulations on the deal couple questions here so what does the dupont transition to super wholesale pricing how does that blend in with your renewal pricing outlook on a consolidated basis and also sort of in the same camp of accounting what does the merger mean for straightline accounting and the gap between ffo and affo per share and lastly in terms of dupont being primarily triple net lease how will you incorporate that into your broader footprint andy power sure so let me just make sure weve got all three of them so the second one was  scott peterson super wholesale straightline accounting triple net lease andy power yes so let me try to tackle these and bill and scott please chime in i would say i mean we dont have an aggregate outlook for the cash marktomarket retention we do think based on duponts historical retention ratios thats a slight improvement to our retention ratios which have all obviously historically been quite high to begin with and then on mark to markets no change in our standalone outlook and we did a very thorough underwriting led by scott and his team and i think we came out at a place where we feel pretty good about those cash mark to markets and we also like the fact that we believe the combined company has a greater ability to potentially hold rate in certain markets be it a silicon valley which is very tight given our large sales force and larger customer base where if we are unable to meet the commercial terms with a customer upon a renewal we have a little bit better options for the releasing of that space going to the technicals of straightline rents we pencil the restraightlining of the rents positive roughly  million in  based on our diligence and then what was the third question scott peterson the third one was how does the triple net lease structures fit within our current structure listen im an old real estate guy and triple net and fullservice gross is a function of high  they end up kind of netting out in the same place in most cases if you structure it properly triple net obviously can be straightforward i would say that generally speaking i think the trend in the industry is towards full service gross but we can certainly structure our lease contracts with our customers in any way that makes sense for them operator michael bilerman of citi michael bilerman two quick follow ups the first is just sort of cadence on future development in some regards dupont just given they were a smaller entity sort of had a slower cadence in some regards how will you sort of go forward in terms of activating new development within the land bank both from a preleasing perspective but also just terms of what youre willing to build without preleasing and how should we think about sort of size of development going forward within the scope of what dupont has today bill stein michael i guess in terms of megawatts actually their active development pipeline was actually on par last season a little bit bigger our active development pipeline as of the end of the first quarters about plus megawatts roughly  preleased and their most recently updated active development pipeline just call it  megawatts about  preleased so fairly close i think our strategy around thats not going to change in terms of making sure we have the full supply chain lined up from the land to the shell to the fully builtout suites and as i mentioned to many that i met with this week i think its a barbell approach and markets like osaka we went fully  and fully preleased the site before we even moved dirt and in markets which weve been tried and true demonstrated success like ashburn we built out incremental spec shells and spec suites because we know we have customers to fill those quite efficiently scott peterson and michael what i can add to that is first and foremost we will be responsive to our customers and the markets so we will always respond to their needs and what we think is prudent within the supplyanddemand fundamentals of a market kind of pros and cons as i think about it we try to handicap it on one level we can be more efficient in terms of building in a market we could build one building at a time instead of each of us building on the other side is we may lease those up faster and start the next development a little quicker with a broader footprint and a broader customer base in those markets and the expansions that come out of those existing customers that should actually be a net positive to what would be our typical develop pipeline in the market michael bilerman and then just as a followup in terms of the why now question which was asked before there was some commentary about dupont sort of rollover and the roll downs that they had and managing that that made it more attractive its also a stockforstock deal and so part of its just exchange ratio and stocks react to certain things so i guess why now from the perspective of where the companies are in their life cycle why does it make more sense today relative to at some point before if it is a stockforstock transaction scott peterson yes and i think it really is going to go back to what we were discussing earlier is that a few years ago we were clearly way more focused on executing on the colocation and connectivity side so that was where the majority of our efforts were placed this is not to indicate that were not highly focused on that anymore because we are this is an extension of the overall strategy of a full spectrum space power and connectivity in core markets on a global scale so this fits in is very complementary to that overall strategy i will say more specifically when we looked at this before our projections as it related to accretion were particularly optimistic and we were a little bit apart from a valuation perspective as i said before the management team has done an excellent job of managing the rolldown exposure and stabilizing that side of the portfolio as well as executing on a growth and new development pipeline strategy so i think this is a different company than you would have seen three years ago operator jonathan atkin of rbc capital markets jonathan atkin so i wondered if this has any bearing im guessing not on the type of product that you offer in toronto and then in portland which is in process and then just going forward around data center design and thoughts about product it may be a bit too soon but any implication as you go forward with kind of the digital way of doing things or is there anything that dupont brings to the mix going forward john stewart ill take the design side of that so if you look at dupont historically built an n design on the ups and the generators which is honestly very close to an n you also see that they had been designing flexibility into their new developments to accommodate n or a higher level of redundancy in those so i think well benefit from a little bit of ip transfer between the two on design they view ups a little bit differently than we knew so i think were looking forward to that analysis on it but i think the net of it all is that were still in that same direction towards an overall kind of n execution on design scott peterson and john just to go to your toronto question we think it presents a really great opportunity where you have similar to our design  or delivery philosophy theyre bringing on roughly six megawatts in the toronto star building but also having optionality for another  megawatts in subsequent phases all at that same site so we think itll be accretive to the growth in that market as well operator and ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our questionandanswer session and it will also conclude our conference call for this morning thank you for

center facilities with extensive tenant improvements in  metropolitan areas across  countries our portfolio of data center facilities is equipped to meet the power and cooling requirements for customers with smaller footprints up to the most demanding corporate it applications many of the properties in our portfolio are located on major aggregation points formed by the physical presence of multiple major telecommunications service providers which reduces our customers’ costs and operational risks and enhances the attractiveness of our properties in addition our strategically located global data center campuses offer our customers a place to grow as their businesses grow and we believe that expanding connectivity offerings in our campus facilities will also enhance the attractiveness of these facilities further the network density interconnection infrastructure and connectivitycentric customers in certain of our facilities has led to the formation of densely connected ecosystems that are difficult to replicate and valuable to customers we believe that a highquality global portfolio like ours could not be easily replicated today on a costcompetitive basis

dallas los angeles new york northern virginia phoenix san francisco seattle and silicon valley metropolitan areas in the united states the amsterdam dublin frankfurt london and paris metropolitan areas in europe and the singapore sydney melbourne hong kong and osaka metropolitan areas in the asia pacific region our portfolio is geographically diversified so that no one metropolitan area represented more than approximately  of the aggregate annualized rent of our portfolio as of december    see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—overview—revenue base” • proven experience attracting and retaining customers we have considerable experience in identifying and attracting new customers and retaining existing customers our specialized data center sales force provides a robust pipeline of new clients while existing customers continue to grow and expand with us during the year ended december    we commenced new leases

other uses • demonstrated investment acumen we have developed detailed standardized procedures for evaluating acquisitions including incomeproducing properties as well as vacant buildings and land suitable for development to ensure that they meet our strategic financial technical and other criteria these procedures and our indepth  table of contents index to financial statements knowledge of the technology and data center industries as well as the real estate industry allow us to identify strategically located properties and evaluate investment opportunities efficiently and as appropriate commit and close quickly our broad network of contacts within a highly fragmented universe of sellers and brokers of technologyrelated real estate enables us to capitalize on acquisition opportunities as a result we acquired a substantial portion of our properties before they were broadly marketed by real estate brokers • flexible data center solutions we provide flexible customeroriented solutions

the power and cooling capabilities to support missioncritical it enterprise applications we believe our turnkey flex ® facilities are effective solutions for customers who may lack the bandwidth

solution provides the physical location required power and network access necessary to support a stateoftheart data center furthermore our data center campuses offer our customers the opportunity to expand and grow in or near their existing deployments within a campus our critical facilities management ® services and team of technical engineers and data center operations experts provide  support for these missioncritical facilities • leading colocation and interconnection platform we believe the acquisition of telx or the telx acquisition and the european portfolio acquisition have established us as a leading provider of colocation interconnection and cloudenablement services globally we believe interconnection is an attractive line of business that would be difficult to build organically and enhances the overall value proposition of our colocation and largefootprint data center product offerings in addition to enhancing our presence in toptier locations throughout the us and europe providing significant opportunities for additional growth we believe the telx acquisition and the european portfolio acquisition expanded our product mix to appeal to a broader spectrum of data center customers • differentiating development advantages our extensive development activity operating scale and processbased approach to data center design construction and operations result in significant cost savings and added value for our customers we have leveraged our purchasing power by securing global purchasing agreements and developing relationships with major equipment

® facilities in our existing powered base building ® facilities on average we are able to deliver a fully commissioned facility in under  weeks finally our access to capital allows us to provide data center solutions for customers who do not want to invest their own capital • diverse customer base across a wide variety of industry sectors we use our indepth knowledge of the requirements and trends for social networking mobile communications analytics cloud and content providers network providers information technology services providers and data center users including financial services companies to market our properties to domestic and international customers with specific technology needs at december    we had over  customers across a variety of industry verticals ranging from cloud and information technology services to financial services manufacturing energy gaming life sciences and consumer products our largest customer ibm accounted for approximately  of the aggregate annualized rent as of december   and no other single customer accounted for more than approximately  of the aggregate annualized rent of our portfolio • experienced and committed management team and organization our senior management team has many years of experience in the technology or real estate industries including experience as investors in advisors to and founders of technology companies we believe that our senior management team’s extensive knowledge of both the real estate and the technology industries provides us with a key competitive advantage further a significant portion of compensation for our senior management team and directors is in the form of common equity interests in our company and we recently instituted minimum stock ownership requirements further aligning their interests with those of external stockholders we have also implemented an employee stock purchase plan which allows our employees to increase their ownership in the company business and growth strategies our primary business objective is maximize value creation on a per share and unit basis through achieving superior organic growth prudently allocating capital and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet  table of contents index to financial statements • achieve superior returns we believe that achieving appropriate riskadjusted returns on our business including on our development pipeline and leasing transactions will deliver superior stockholder returns at december    we had approximately  million square feet of space under active development for turnkey flex ® and powered base building ® products in five us metropolitan areas three european metropolitan areas one canadian metropolitan area and one asian metropolitan area consisting of approximately  million square feet of base building construction and  million square feet of data center construction we may continue to build out our development pipeline when justified by anticipated returns we also believe that providing an even stronger value proposition to our customers including through new and enhanced product offerings as well as improving operational efficiencies will further drive improved returns for our business • provide foundational services to enable customers and partners we believe that our global infrastructure platform through which we offer the foundational services of space power and connectivity will enable our customers and partners to serve their customers and grow their businesses we believe our internet gateway facilities individual data centers and data center campuses are attractive to a wide variety of customers and partners of all sizes furthermore we believe our colocation and interconnection offerings as well as the densely connected ecosystems that have developed within our facilities are valuable and critical to our customers and partners • prudently allocate capital  we believe that the accretive deployment of capital at sufficiently positive spreads above our cost of capital enables us to increase cash flow and create longterm stockholder value our relationships with corporate information technology groups technology tenants and real estate brokers who are dedicated to serving these tenants provide us with ongoing access to potential investment opportunities and frequently enable us to avoid competitive bidding in addition the specialized nature of technologyrelated real estate makes it more difficult for traditional real estate investors to underwrite resulting in reduced competition for investments relative to other property types we believe this dynamic creates an opportunity for us to generate better riskadjusted returns on our capital we employ a collaborative approach to deal analysis risk management and asset allocation focusing on key elements such as market fundamentals accessibility to fiber and power and the local regulatory environment • preserve the flexibility of our balance sheet we are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure we target a debttoadjusted ebitda ratio at or less than x fixed charge coverage of greater than three times and floating rate debt at less than  of total outstanding debt in addition we strive to maintain a wellladdered debt maturity schedule and we seek to maximize the menu of our available sources of capital while minimizing the cost since digital realty trust inc’s initial public offering in  our company has raised approximately  billion of capital through common preferred and convertible preferred equity offerings exchangeable debt offerings nonexchangeable bond offerings our global revolving credit facility our term loan facility the prudential shelf facility secured mortgage financings and refinancings joint venture partnerships and sales of noncore assets we endeavor to maintain financial flexibility while using our liquidity and access to capital to support operations including our acquisition leasing and development programs and global campus expansion which are important sources of our growth • maximize propertylevel cash flow  we aggressively manage our properties to maximize cash flow we often acquire properties with substantial inplace cash flow and some vacancy which enables us to create upside through leaseup we control our costs by negotiating expense passthrough provisions in tenant leases for operating expenses including power costs and certain capital expenditures we also control costs by driving operating efficiencies which include focusing on centralizing functions and optimizing operations as well as improving processes and technologies we believe that expanding our global data center campuses will also contribute to operating efficiencies because we expect to achieve economies of scale on our campus environments • leverage strong industry relationships we use our strong industry relationships with national and regional corporate enterprise information technology groups and technologyintensive companies to identify and comprehensively respond to their data center needs our sales professionals are real estate and technology industry specialists who can develop complex facility solutions for the most demanding data center and other technology tenants  table of contents index to financial statements sustainability we believe that addressing sustainability matters

americans with disabilities act of  or the ada to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ada the ada may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable we believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ada and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ada however noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect environmental matters under various laws relating to the protection of the environment a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at or emanating from that property such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of the contaminants and the liability may be joint and several the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  or cercla established a regulatory and remedial program intended to provide for the investigation and cleanup of facilities where or from which a release of any hazardous substance into the environment has occurred or is threatened cercla’s primary mechanism for remedying such problems is to impose strict joint and several liability for cleanup of facilities on current owners and operators of the site former owners and operators of the site at the time of the disposal of the hazardous substances any person who arranges for the transportation disposal or treatment of the hazardous substances and the transporters who select the disposal and treatment facilities regardless of the care exercised by such persons cercla also imposes liability for the cost of evaluating and remedying any damage to natural resources the costs of cercla investigation and cleanup can be very substantial cercla also authorizes the imposition of a lien in favor of the united states on all real property subject to or affected by a remedial action for all costs for which a party is liable subject to certain procedural restrictions cercla gives a responsible party the right to bring a contribution action against other responsible parties for their allocable shares of investigative and remedial costs our ability to obtain reimbursement from others for their allocable shares of such costs would be limited by our ability to find other responsible parties and prove the extent of their responsibility their financial resources and other procedural requirements various state laws also

assessments do not generally include soil samplings subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey and the assessments may have failed to reveal all material environmental conditions liabilities or

jointly and severally liable under cercla and various state laws for the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination caused by previous owners or operators fuel storage tanks are present at most of our properties and if releases were to occur we may be liable for the costs of cleaning any resulting contamination the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to thirdparty liability or materially adversely affect our ability to sell lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral in addition some of our tenants particularly those in the biotechnology and life sciences industry and those in the technology manufacturing industry routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties environmental laws and regulations subject our tenants and potentially us to liability resulting from these activities or from previous industrial or retail uses of those properties we could be held jointly and severally liable under cercla and various state laws for the investigation and remediation of hazardous substances released

investigation and remediation of environmental matters will not affect our ability to pay dividends to digital realty trust inc’s stockholders and distributions to digital realty trust lp’s unitholders or that such costs or other remedial measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations or our competitive position our properties and their uses often require permits from various government agencies including permits related to zoning and land use such as permits to operate data center facilities certain permits from state or local environmental regulatory agencies including regulators of air quality are usually required to install and operate dieselpowered generators which provide emergency backup power at most of our facilities these permits often set emissions limits for certain air pollutants including oxides of nitrogen in addition various federal state and local environmental health and safety requirements such as fire requirements and treated and storm water discharge requirements apply to some of our properties changes to applicable regulations such as air quality regulations or the permit requirements for equipment at our facilities could hinder or prevent our construction or operation of data center facilities the environmental laws and regulations to which our properties are subject

factors constitute forwardlooking statements please refer to the section entitled “forwardlooking statements” starting on page  risks related to our business and operations global economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition general economic conditions and the cost and availability of capital may be adversely affected in some or all of the metropolitan areas in which we own properties and conduct our operations instability in the us european and other international financial markets and economies may adversely affect our ability and the ability of our tenants to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may result in adverse effects on our and our tenants’ businesses financial condition and results of operations in addition our access to funds under our global revolving credit facility depends on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us we cannot assure you that longterm disruptions in the global economy and tighter credit conditions among and potential failures or nationalizations of third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse effect on our lenders if our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to us our business results of operation cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected if we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow additional funds access our existing lines of credit or raise equity or debt capital we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation curtailing development activity disposing of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms or entering into or renewing leases on less favorable terms than we otherwise would our business depends upon the demand for technologyrelated real estate our portfolio of properties consists primarily of technologyrelated real estate and data center real estate in particular a decrease in the demand for data center space internet gateway facilities or other technologyrelated real estate would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a portfolio with a more diversified tenant base or less specialized use our substantial development activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns including recessions as well as adverse developments in the data center internet and data communications and broader technology industries any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate it spending or reduced demand for data center space reduced demand could also result from business relocations including to metropolitan areas that we do not currently serve changes in industry practice or in technology such as virtualization technology more efficient or miniaturization of computing or networking devices or devices that require higher power densities than today’s devices could also reduce demand for the physical data center space we provide or make the tenant improvements in our facilities obsolete or in need of significant upgrades to remain viable in addition the development of new technologies the adoption of new industry standards or other factors could render many of our tenants’ current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and contribute to a downturn in their businesses thereby increasing the likelihood that they default under their leases become insolvent or file for bankruptcy  table of contents index to financial statements we may be unable to lease vacant or development space renew leases or release space as leases expire at december    we owned approximately  million square feet of space under active development and approximately  million square feet of space held for future development we intend to continue to add new space to our development inventory and to continue to develop additional space from this inventory a portion of the space that we develop has been and may continue to be developed on a speculative basis meaning that we do not have a signed lease for the space when we begin the development process we also develop space specifically for tenants pursuant to leases signed prior to beginning the development process in those cases if we fail to meet our development obligations under those leases these tenants may be able to terminate the leases and we would be required to find a new tenant for this space in addition in certain circumstances we lease data center facilities prior to their completion if we fail to complete the facilities in a timely manner the tenant may be entitled to terminate its lease seek damages or penalties against us or pursue other remedies and we may be required to find a new tenant for the space we cannot assure you that once we have developed space or land we will be able to successfully lease it at all or at rates we consider favorable or expected at the time we commenced development if we are not able to complete development in a timely manner or successfully lease the space that we develop if development costs are higher than we currently estimate or if lease rates are lower than expected when we began the project or are otherwise undesirable our financial condition results of operations cash flow cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected in addition as of december    leases representing  of the square footage of the properties in our portfolio excluding space held for development were scheduled to expire through  and an additional  of the net rentable square footage excluding space held for development was available to be leased some of this space may require substantial capital investment to meet the power and cooling requirements of our customers or may no longer be suitable for their needs in addition we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be released at all or at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates if the rental rates for our properties decrease our existing tenants do not renew their leases we do not lease or release our available space including newly developed space and space for which leases are scheduled to expire or it takes longer for us to lease or release this space or for rents to commence on this space our financial condition results of operations cash flow cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected additionally leasing space in one of our data centers typically involves a significant commitment of resources and due diligence on the part of our customers regarding the adequacy of our facilities as a result the leasing of data center space can have a long sales cycle and we may expend significant time and resources in pursuing a particular transaction that may not result in revenue our inability to adequately manage the risks associated with the sales cycle may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our growth depends on external sources of capital which are outside of our control in order for digital realty trust inc to maintain its qualification as a reit it is required under the internal revenue code of  as amended which we refer to as the code to annually distribute at least  of its net taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain in addition digital realty trust inc will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes less than  of its net taxable income including any net capital gains digital realty trust lp is required to make distributions to digital realty trust inc that will enable the latter to satisfy this distribution requirement and avoid income and excise tax liability because of these distribution requirements we may not be able to fund future capital needs including any necessary acquisition or development financing from operating cash flow consequently we rely on thirdparty sources to fund our capital needs our access to thirdparty sources of capital depends on a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our business prospects and growth potential our current and expected future earnings funds from operations our cash flow and cash distributions and the market price per share of digital realty trust inc’s common stock we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing at all or on terms favorable or acceptable to us any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage further equity markets have experienced high volatility recently and we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise capital through the sale of equity securities at all or on favorable terms sales of equity on unfavorable terms could result in substantial dilution to digital realty trust inc’s common stockholders and digital realty trust lp’s unitholders in addition we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms if we cannot obtain capital from thirdparty sources we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist satisfy our debt service obligations pay cash dividends to digital realty trust inc’s stockholders or make distributions to digital realty trust lp’s unitholders  table of contents index to financial statements declining real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition we review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price a significant adverse change in how the property is being used or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development a change in our intended holding period due to our intention to sell an asset or a history of operating or cash flow losses when such impairment indicators exist we review an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment’s use and eventual disposition and compare it to the carrying value of the property we consider factors such as future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand competition and other factors if our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods a worsening real estate market may cause us to reevaluate the assumptions used in our impairment analysis impairment charges could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash available for distribution we depend on significant tenants and many of our properties are singletenant properties or are currently occupied by single tenants as of december    the  largest tenants in our property portfolio represented approximately  of the total annualized rent generated by our properties our largest tenants by annualized rent are subsidiaries of ibm centurylink inc savvisqwest and equinix operating company inc in july  ibm acquired softlayer technologies inc including space leased by softlayer ibm leased approximately  square feet of net rentable space as of december    representing approximately  of the total annualized rent generated by our properties in  centurylink inc acquired savvis communications corporation or savvis and qwest communications international inc or qwest which are our direct tenants savvis and qwest are now whollyowned subsidiaries of centurylink inc centurylink inc savvisqwest leased approximately  million square feet of net rentable space as of december    representing approximately  of the total annualized rent generated by our properties in addition  of our  operating properties are occupied by single tenants including properties occupied solely by ibm and centurylink inc savvisqwest in november  centurylink inc announced its entry into a definitive agreement to divest its data centers and colocation business although we are assessing the situation at this time we cannot estimate what impact if any that this transaction may have on our business many factors including global economic conditions may cause our tenants to experience a downturn in their businesses or otherwise experience a lack of liquidity which may weaken their financial condition and result in their failure to make timely rental payments or their default under their leases if any tenant defaults or fails to make timely rent payments we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our tenants may choose to develop new data centers or expand their own existing data centers which could result in the loss of one or more key tenants or reduce demand for our newly developed data centers which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations our tenants may choose to develop new data centers or expand or consolidate into data centers that we do not own in the future in the event that any of our key tenants were to do so it could result in a loss of business to us or put pressure on our pricing if we lose a tenant we cannot assure you that we would be able to replace that tenant at a competitive rate or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties if any tenant becomes a debtor in a case under the federal bankruptcy code we cannot evict the tenant solely because of the bankruptcy in addition the bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us our claim against the tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in either case our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full our revenue and cash available for distribution could be materially adversely affected if any of our significant tenants were to become bankrupt  table of contents index to financial statements or insolvent or suffer a downturn in its business or fail to renew its lease or renew on terms less favorable to us than its current terms as of february   we had no material tenants in bankruptcy    our contracts with our customers may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with our customers pursuant to which our customers lease or license data center space and power from us as well as purchase connectivity products these contracts typically contain indemnification and liability provisions in addition to service level commitments which could potentially impose a significant cost on us in the event of losses arising out of certain breaches of such agreements services to be provided by us or our subcontractors or from third party claims customers increasingly are looking to pass through their regulatory obligations and other liabilities to their outsourced data center providers and we may not be able to limit our liability or damages in an event of loss suffered by such customers whether as a result of our breach of agreement or otherwise  further liabilities and standards for damages and enforcement actions including the regulatory framework applicable to different types of losses vary by jurisdiction and we may be subject to greater liability for certain losses in certain jurisdictions additionally in connection with our acquisitions we have assumed existing agreements with customers that may subject us to greater liability for such an event of loss if such an event of loss occurred we could be liable for material monetary damages and could incur significant legal fees in defending against such an action which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our portfolio of properties depends upon local economic conditions and is geographically concentrated in certain locations our portfolio is located in  metropolitan areas some of these areas have experienced downturns in recent years we depend upon the local economic conditions in these areas including local real estate conditions and our operations revenue and cash available for distribution could be materially adversely affected by a downturn in local economic conditions in these areas our operations may also be affected if too many competing properties are built in any of these areas or supply otherwise increases or exceeds demand we cannot assure you that these locations will grow or will remain favorable to technologyrelated real estate such as our properties as of december    our portfolio including the  properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was geographically concentrated in the following metropolitan areas   metropolitan area percentage of december   total annualized rent  new york   northern virginia   london united kingdom   dallas   silicon valley   chicago   phoenix   san francisco   singapore   atlanta   seattle   boston   los angeles   other   total      table of contents index to financial statements  annualized rent is monthly contractual rent defined as cash base rent before abatements under existing leases as of december    multiplied by  the aggregate amount of abatements for the year ended december   was approximately  million in addition we are currently developing properties in certain of these metropolitan areas any negative changes in real estate technology or economic conditions in these metropolitan areas in particular could negatively impact our performance our growth depends upon the successful development of our existing space and developable land and new properties acquired for development and any delays or unexpected costs in such development may delay and harm our growth prospects future operating results and financial condition at december    we had approximately  million square feet of space under active development and approximately  million square feet of space held for future development we have built and may continue to build out a large portion of this space on a speculative basis at significant cost our successful development of these projects is subject to many risks including those associated with • delays in construction • budget overruns • changes to the plans or specifications • construction site accidents and other casualties • increased prices for raw materials or building supplies • lack of availability andor increased costs for specialized data center components including long lead time items such as generators • financing availability including our ability to obtain construction financing and permanent financing • increases in interest rates or credit spreads • labor availability and costs • labor disputes and work stoppages with contractors subcontractors or others that are constructing the project • failure of contractors to perform on a timely basis or at all or other misconduct on the part of contractors • timing of the commencement of rental payments • access to sufficient power and related costs of providing such power to our tenants • environmental issues • fire flooding earthquakes and other natural disasters • geological construction excavation and equipment problems and • delays or denials of entitlements or permits including zoning and related permits or other delays resulting from requirements of public agencies and utility companies in addition while we intend to develop data center properties primarily in metropolitan areas we are familiar with we may in the future develop properties in new geographic regions where we expect the development of property to result in favorable riskadjusted returns on our investment we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the development of properties in other metropolitan areas which could adversely affect our ability to develop such properties successfully or at all or to achieve expected performance development activities regardless of whether they are ultimately successful also typically require a substantial portion of our management’s time and attention this may distract our management from focusing on other operational activities of our business if we are unable to complete development projects successfully our business may be adversely affected we may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions on favorable terms or at all we continually evaluate the market of available properties and businesses and may acquire additional real estate when opportunities exist our ability to acquire properties or businesses on favorable terms may be subject to the following significant risks • we may be unable to acquire a desired property or business because of competition from other real estate investors with significant capital including both publicly traded reits and institutional investment funds  table of contents index to financial statements • even if we are able to acquire a desired property or business competition from other potential acquirors may significantly increase the purchase price or result in other less favorable terms • even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of real estate or businesses these agreements are subject to customary conditions to closing including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction and • we may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or at all additionally we may acquire properties or businesses subject to liabilities and without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown or contingent liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by tenants vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties or businesses tax liabilities claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties or businesses and other liabilities whether incurred in the ordinary course of business or otherwise the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with acquired properties or businesses may exceed our expectations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   further we have entered and may in the future enter into transactions with limited representations and warranties or with representations and warranties that do not survive the closing of such transactions in which event we would have no or limited recourse against the sellers of such properties or businesses while we usually require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive such indemnification is often limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties finally indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the properties or businesses acquired by us while the sellers are generally contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses as well if we cannot complete property or business acquisitions on favorable terms or at all our financial condition results of operations cash flow cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected we may be unable to successfully integrate and operate acquired properties or businesses even if we are able to make acquisitions on advantageous terms our ability to successfully operate them may be subject to the following significant risks • we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties • we may be unable to integrate new acquisitions quickly and efficiently particularly acquisitions of operating businesses or portfolios of properties into our existing operations • acquired properties may be subject to reassessment which may result in higher than expected property tax payments and • market conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates on acquired properties if we cannot integrate and operate acquired properties or businesses to meet our financial expectations our financial condition results of operations cash flow cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected our recent acquisitions may not achieve the intended benefits or may disrupt our plans and operations acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial or strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of the transaction we acquired telx in october  and a portfolio of european properties in july  which we refer to as the european portfolio there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate telx or the european portfolio with our business or otherwise realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions depends to a large extent on our ability to integrate telx and the european portfolio with our business the combination of two independent businesses can be a complex costly and timeconsuming process our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to effectively manage our expanded operations further the integration process requires significant time and focus from our management team and may divert attention from the daytoday operations of our business  table of contents index to financial statements the expected synergies from the acquisitions may not be fully realized which could result in increased costs and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses and loss of customer relationships among other potential adverse consequences the risks of combining businesses include among others • we may have underestimated the costs to make any necessary improvements to the acquired properties • the acquired properties may be subject to reassessment which may result in higher than expected tax payments • we may face difficulties in integrating employees and in retaining key personnel and • we may face challenges in keeping existing customers including key magnet customers which could adversely impact interconnection and colocation revenue   many of these risks are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenue and diversion of our management’s time and energy which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition even if our operations are integrated successfully with the operations of our acquisitions we may not realize the full benefits of the the acquisitions including the synergies operating efficiencies or sales or growth opportunities that are expected these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all all of these factors could decrease or delay any potential accretive effect of the acquisitions and negatively impact the price of our common stock due to the acquisition of telx and the european portfolio we may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no or limited recourse against the sellers telx and the european portfolio may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no or limited recourse against the sellers unknown or contingent liabilities might include liabilities for cleanup or remediation of environmental conditions claims of customers vendors or other persons dealing with the acquired entities tax liabilities and other liabilities whether incurred in the ordinary course of business or otherwise with respect to the telx acquisition we have entered into an insurance policy with a syndicate of insurers providing for coverage for breaches of certain representations and warranties contained in the agreement and plan of merger subject to certain exclusions and a deductible however there can be no assurance that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches of telx’s representations and warranties in addition the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with telx or the european portfolio may exceed our expectations which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we may be unable to source offmarket deal flow in the future a component of our growth strategy is to continue to acquire additional technologyrelated real estate to date a substantial portion of our acquisitions were acquired before they were widely marketed by real estate brokers or “offmarket” properties that are acquired offmarket are typically more attractive to us as a purchaser because of the absence of competitive bidding which could potentially lead to higher prices we obtain access to offmarket deal flow from numerous sources if we cannot obtain offmarket deal flow in the future our ability to locate and acquire additional properties at attractive prices could be adversely affected we have substantial debt and face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities including refinancing and interest rate risks our total consolidated indebtedness at december   was approximately  billion and we may incur significant additional debt to finance future acquisition and development activities as of december    we have a  billion global revolving credit facility which has a borrowing limit that we may increase to up to  billion subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent at december    approximately  billion was available under this facility net of outstanding letters of credit as of february   we had approximately  billion available under the refinanced global revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit our substantial indebtedness has important consequences in that it currently requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures expansion efforts distributions and other general corporate purposes additionally it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or obtain financing for expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes on  table of contents index to financial statements terms and conditions acceptable to us if at all or affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions in addition we may violate restrictive covenants or fail to maintain financial ratios specified in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and our secured lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties or our interests in the entities that own the properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases a foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our access to capital financial condition results of operations cash flow and cash available for distribution further our default under any one of our loans could result in a cross default on other indebtedness furthermore foreclosures could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds a circumstance which could hinder digital realty trust inc’s ability to meet the reit distribution requirements imposed by the code additional risks related to our indebtedness are described below we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness it is likely that we will need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures if we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions then our cash flow may not be sufficient in all years to repay all such maturing debt and to pay distributions further if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase fluctuations in interest rates could materially affect our financial results and may increase the risk our counterparty defaults on our interest rate hedges  because a significant portion of our debt including debt incurred under our global revolving credit facility bears interest at variable rates increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense if the united states federal reserve increases shortterm interest rates this would have a significant upward impact on shorterterm interest rates including the interest rates that our variable rate debt is based upon potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and therefore negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations and reduce our access to capital markets we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for a significant portion of our floating rate debt other than the debt we incur under our global revolving credit facility increased interest rates may increase the risk that the counterparties to our swap agreements will default on their obligations which could further increase our exposure to interest rate fluctuations conversely if interest rates are lower than our swapped fixed rates we will be required to pay more for our debt than we would have had we not entered into the swap agreements adverse changes in our company’s credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity the credit ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt and digital realty trust inc’s preferred stock are based on our company’s operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of our company our company’s credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur we cannot assure you that our company will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event our current credit ratings are downgraded we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing also a downgrade in our company’s credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments for example if the credit ratings of our senior unsecured longterm debt are downgraded to below investment grade levels we may not be able to obtain or maintain extensions on certain of our existing debt adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our refinancing and other capital market activities our ability to manage our debt maturities our future growth our financial condition the market price of digital realty trust inc’s stock and our development and acquisition activity our global revolving credit facility term loan facility   notes due   notes due   notes due   notes due   notes due  notes due   notes due   guaranteed notes due  and  notes due  restrict our ability to engage in some business activities  our global revolving credit facility and term loan facility contain negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that among other things • restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness • restrict our ability to make certain investments • restrict our ability to merge with another company • restrict our ability to create incur or assume liens and  table of contents index to financial statements • require us to maintain financial coverage ratios including with respect to unencumbered assets in addition the global revolving credit facility and the term loan facility restrict digital realty trust inc from making distributions to its stockholders or redeeming or otherwise repurchasing shares of its capital stock after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default except in limited circumstances including as necessary to enable digital realty trust inc to maintain its qualification as a reit and to avoid the payment of income or excise tax in addition our  notes due  or the

due  or the   notes and our  notes due  or the   notes are governed by indentures which contain various restrictive covenants including limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness and requirements to maintain a pool of unencumbered assets these restrictions and the restrictions in our global revolving credit facility and term loan facility could cause us to default on our   notes   notes  notes   notes   notes  notes  notes   notes and   notes global revolving credit facility or term loan facility as applicable or negatively affect our operations or our ability to pay dividends to digital realty trust inc’s stockholders or distributions to digital realty trust lp’s unitholders which could have a material adverse effect on the market value of digital realty trust inc’s common stock and preferred stock   failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect results of operations  we seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements such as interest rate cap or swap lock agreements these agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable our policy is to use these derivatives only to hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings not for speculative or trading purposes and to enter into contracts only with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors however we may choose to change this policy in the future approximately  of our total indebtedness as of december   was subject to fixed interest rates or variable rates subject to interest rate swaps we do not currently hedge our global revolving credit facility and as our borrowings under our global revolving credit facility increase so will our percentage of indebtedness not subject to fixed rates and our exposure to interest rates increase hedging may reduce the overall returns on our investments failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations we have owned or managed certain of our properties for a limited time our portfolio consisted of  properties at december    including  properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures fortyfour of our properties have been under our management for less than five years the properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us that could affect their valuation or revenue potential we cannot assure you that the operating performance of the properties will not decline under our management we may have difficulty managing our growth we have significantly and rapidly expanded the size of our company our growth may significantly strain our management operational and financial resources and systems in addition as a reporting company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  and the sarbanesoxley act of  or the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of these rules and regulations will increase our accounting legal and financial compliance costs and may strain our management and financial legal and operational resources and systems an inability to manage our growth effectively or the increased strain on our management of our resources and systems could result in deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting and could negatively impact financial condition results of operations and our cash available for distribution  table of contents index to financial statements potential losses may not be covered by insurance we currently carry commercial general liability property business interruption including loss of rental income and other insurance policies to cover insurable risks to our company we select policy specifications insured limits and deductibles which we believe to be appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss the cost of the coverage and standard industry practices our insurance policies contain industry standard exclusions and we do not carry insurance for generally uninsurable perils such as loss from war or nuclear reaction although we purchase earthquake insurance  it is subject to high deductibles and a significant portion of our properties is located in seismically active zones such as california which represents approximately  of our portfolio’s annualized rent as of december    one catastrophic event for example in california could significantly impact multiple properties the aggregate deductible amounts could be significant and the limits we purchase could prove to be insufficient which could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore a catastrophic regional event could also severely impact some of our insurers rendering them insolvent or unable to fully pay on claims despite their current financial strength in addition we may discontinue purchasing insurance against earthquake flood or windstorm or other perils on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any of these policies exceeds in our judgment the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss in addition many of our buildings contain extensive and highly valuable technologyrelated improvements under the terms of our leases tenants are obligated to maintain adequate insurance coverage applicable to such improvements and under most circumstances use their insurance proceeds to restore such improvements after a casualty event in the event of a casualty or other loss involving one of our buildings with extensive installed tenant improvements our tenants may have the right to terminate their leases if we do not rebuild the base building within prescribed times in such cases the proceeds from tenants’ insurance will not be available to us to restore the improvements and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to replicate the technologyrelated improvements made by such tenants furthermore the terms of our mortgage indebtedness at certain of our properties may require us to pay insurance proceeds over to our lenders under certain circumstances rather than use the proceeds to repair the property if we or one or more of our tenants experience a loss which is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties in addition if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness even if these properties were irreparably damaged we face significant competition which may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties we compete with numerous data center developers owners and operators many of whom own properties similar to ours in some of the same metropolitan areas where our properties are located including coresite realty corporation cyrusone inc dupont fabros technology inc equinix inc qts realty trust inc and various local developers in the us as well as global switch holdings limited and various regional operators in europe asia and australia in addition we may in the future face competition from new entrants into the data center market including new entrants who may acquire our current competitors some of our competitors and potential competitors have significant advantages over us including greater name recognition longer operating histories preexisting relationships with current or potential customers significantly greater financial marketing and other resources and more ready access to capital which allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities if our competitors offer space that our tenants or potential tenants perceive to be superior to ours based on numerous factors including available power security considerations location or connectivity or if they offer rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we are offering we may lose tenants or potential tenants or be required to incur costs to improve our properties or reduce our rental rates in addition recently many of our competitors have developed and continue to develop additional data center space if the supply of data center space continues to increase as a result of these activities or otherwise rental rates may be reduced or we may face delays in leasing or be unable to lease our vacant space including space that we develop   further if tenants or potential tenants desire services that we do not offer we may not be able to lease our space to those tenants our financial condition results of operations cash flow cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any or all of these factors joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers’ financial condition and disputes between us and our coventurers we currently and may in the future coinvest with third parties through partnerships joint ventures or other entities acquiring noncontrolling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property partnership joint venture or other entity in these events we are not in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain  table of contents index to financial statements circumstances involve risks not present when a third party is not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic tax or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives our joint venture partners may take actions that are not within our control which would require us to dispose of the joint venture asset or transfer it to a taxable reit subsidiary in order for digital realty trust inc to maintain its status as a reit such investments may also lead to impasses for example as to whether to sell a property because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and effort on our daytoday business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers may subject properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers each of these factors may result in returns on these investments being less than we expect or in losses and our financial and operating results may be adversely affected our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed we depend on the efforts of key personnel of our company particularly a william stein digital realty trust inc’s chief executive officer andrew p power digital realty trust inc’s chief financial officer jarrett appleby digital realty trust inc’s chief operating officer and scott peterson digital realty trust inc’s chief investment officer they are important to our success for many reasons including that each has a national or regional reputation in our industry and the investment community that attracts investors and business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with investors lenders existing and potential tenants and industry personnel if we lost their services our business and investment opportunities and our relationships with lenders and other capital markets participants existing and prospective tenants and industry personnel could suffer many of our company’s other senior employees also have strong technology finance and real estate industry reputations as a result we have greater access to potential acquisitions financing leasing and other opportunities and are better able to negotiate with tenants as the number of our competitors increases it becomes more likely that a competitor would attempt to hire certain of these individuals away from our company the loss of any of these key personnel would result in the loss of these and other benefits and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations our properties may not be suitable for leasing to data center or traditional technology office tenants without significant expenditures or renovations because many of our properties contain tenant improvements installed at our tenants’ expense they may be better suited for a specific data center user or technology industry tenant and could require significant modification in order for us to release vacant space to another data center user or technology industry tenant the tenant improvements may also become outdated or obsolete as the result of technological change the passage of time or other factors in addition our development space will generally require substantial improvement to be suitable for data center use for the same reason our properties also may not be suitable for leasing to traditional office tenants without significant expenditures or renovations as a result we may be required to invest significant amounts or offer significant discounts to tenants in order to lease or release that space either of which could adversely affect our financial and operating results our data center infrastructure may become obsolete and we may not be able to upgrade our power and cooling systems costeffectively or at all our data center infrastructure may become obsolete due to the development of new systems to deliver power to or eliminate heat in our data center facilities additionally our data center infrastructure could become obsolete as a result of the development of new server technology that does not require the levels of critical load and heat removal that our facilities are designed to provide and could be run less expensively on a different platform in addition our power and cooling systems are difficult and expensive to upgrade accordingly we may not be able to efficiently upgrade or change these systems to meet new demands without incurring significant costs that we may not be able to pass on to our customers which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations ownership of properties located outside of the united states subjects us to foreign currency and related risks which may adversely impact our ability to make distributions we owned  properties located outside of the united states at december    in addition we are currently considering and will in the future consider additional international acquisitions  table of contents index to financial statements the ownership of properties located outside of the united states subjects us to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar we expect that our principal foreign currency exposure will be to the british pound the euro and the singapore dollar changes in the relation of these currencies to the us dollar will affect our revenues and operating margins may materially adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flow cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt obligations we may attempt to mitigate some or all of the risk of currency fluctuation by financing our properties in the local currency denominations although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so or that this will be effective we may also engage in direct hedging activities to mitigate the risks of exchange rate fluctuations in a manner consistent with our qualifications as a reit although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so or that this will be effective our international activities are subject to unique risks different than those faced by us in the united states and we may not be able to effectively manage our international business we have acquired and developed and may continue to acquire and develop properties outside the united states our foreign operations involve risks not generally associated with investments in the united states including • our limited knowledge of and relationships with sellers tenants contractors suppliers or other parties in these metropolitan areas • complexity and costs associated with managing international development and operations • difficulty in hiring qualified management sales and construction personnel and service providers in a timely fashion • differing employment practices and labor issues • multiple conflicting and changing legal regulatory entitlement and permitting and tax and treaty environments • exposure to increased taxation confiscation or expropriation • currency transfer restrictions and limitations on our ability to distribute cash earned in foreign jurisdictions to the united states • difficulty in enforcing agreements in nonus jurisdictions including those entered into in connection with our acquisitions or in the event of a default by one or more of our tenants suppliers or contractors • local business and cultural factors and • political and economic instability including sovereign credit risk in certain geographic regions our inability to overcome these risks could adversely affect our foreign operations and could harm our business and results of operations we face risks with our international acquisitions associated with investing in unfamiliar metropolitan areas we have acquired and may continue to acquire properties on a strategic and selective basis in international metropolitan areas that are new to us when we acquire properties located in these metropolitan areas we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy and culture forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures in addition due diligence transaction and structuring costs may be higher than those we may face in the united states we work to mitigate such risks through extensive diligence and research and associations with experienced partners however we cannot assure you that all such risks will be eliminated the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business which could adversely affect our results of operations we are a global company with worldwide operations including material business operations in europe in june  a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum the referendum was advisory and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the united kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process nevertheless the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union and has given rise to calls for the governments of other european union member states to consider withdrawal these developments or the perception that any of them could occur have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and could significantly reduce global  table of contents index to financial statements market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets asset valuations currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility lack of clarity about future united kingdom laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital in the united kingdom if the united kingdom and the european union are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other european union member states pursue withdrawal barrierfree access between the united kingdom and other european union member states or among the european economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations future consolidation in the technology industry could materially adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our potential tenants and could make us more dependent on a more limited number of tenants mergers or consolidations of technology companies in the future could reduce the number of our tenants and potential tenants if our tenants merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our tenants they may discontinue or reduce the use of our data centers in the future any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations we depend on third parties to provide network connectivity to the tenants in our data centers and any delays or disruptions in connectivity may materially adversely affect our operating results and cash flow we are not a telecommunications carrier although our tenants generally are responsible for providing their own network connectivity we still depend upon the presence of telecommunications carriers’ fiber networks serving the locations of our data centers in order to attract and retain tenants we believe that the availability of carrier capacity will directly affect our ability to achieve our projected results any carrier may elect not to offer its services within our data centers any carrier that has decided to provide network connectivity to our data centers may not continue to do so for any period of time further some carriers are experiencing business difficulties or have announced consolidations as a result some carriers may be forced to downsize or terminate connectivity within our data centers which could have an adverse effect on the business of our tenants and in turn our own operating results our new data centers require construction and operation of a sophisticated redundant fiber network the construction required to connect multiple carrier facilities to our data centers is complex and involves factors outside of our control including regulatory requirements and the availability of construction resources we have started to obtain the right to use network resources owned by other companies including rights to use dark fiber in order to attract telecommunications carriers and customers to our portfolio if the establishment of highly diverse network connectivity to our data centers does not occur is materially delayed or is discontinued or is subject to failure our operating results and cash flow may be materially adversely affected additionally any hardware or fiber failures on this network may result in significant loss of connectivity to our data centers this could negatively affect our ability to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations failure to attract grow and retain a balanced customer base including key magnet customers could harm our business and operating results our ability to attract grow and retain a balanced customer base consisting of a variety of enterprises including companies such as financial services companies and social mobile analytics cloud digital content and network service providers some of which we consider to be key magnets drawing in other customers may affect our ability to maximize our revenues balanced customer bases within each facility will enable us to better generate significant interconnection revenues which in turn increases our overall revenues our ability to attract customers to our data centers will depend on a variety of factors including our product offerings the presence of carriers the overall mix of customers the presence of key customers attracting business through ecosystems the data center’s operating reliability and security and our ability to effectively market our product offerings our inability to develop provide or effectively execute any of these factors may hinder the development growth and retention of a balanced customer base and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations any failure of our physical infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business reputation and could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition our business depends on providing customers with highly reliable service including with respect to power supply physical security and maintenance of environmental conditions we may fail to provide such service as a result of numerous factors including mechanical failure power outage human error physical or electronic security breaches war terrorism and  table of contents index to financial statements related conflicts or similar events worldwide fire earthquake hurricane flood and other natural disasters sabotage and vandalism problems at one or more of our data centers whether or not within our control could result in service interruptions or equipment damage substantially all of our customer leases include terms requiring us to meet certain service level commitments to our customers any failure to meet these or other commitments or any equipment damage in our data centers including as a result of mechanical failure power outage human error or other reasons could subject us to liability under our lease terms including service level credits against customer rent payments monetary damages or in certain cases of repeated failures the right by the customer to terminate the lease service interruptions equipment failures or security breaches may also expose us to additional legal liability and monetary damages and damage our brand and reputation and could cause our customers to terminate or not renew their leases in addition we may be unable to attract new customers if we have a reputation for service disruptions equipment failures or physical or electronic security breaches in our data centers any such failures could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are dependent upon thirdparty suppliers for power and certain other services and we are vulnerable to service failures of our thirdparty suppliers and to price increases by such suppliers we rely on third parties to provide power to our data centers and we cannot ensure that these third parties will deliver such power in adequate quantities or on a consistent basis if the amount of power available to us is inadequate to support our customer requirements we may be unable to satisfy our obligations to our customers or grow our business in addition our data centers may be susceptible to power shortages and planned or unplanned power outages caused by these shortages power outages may last beyond our backup and alternative power arrangements which would harm our customers and our business any loss of services or equipment damage could adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results and harm our reputation in addition we may be subject to risks and unanticipated costs associated with obtaining power from various utility companies utilities that serve our data centers may be dependent on and sensitive to price increases for a particular type of fuel such as coal oil or natural gas in addition the price of these fuels and the electricity generated from them could increase as a result of proposed legislative measures related to climate change or efforts to regulate carbon emissions increases in the cost of power at any of our data centers would put those locations at a competitive disadvantage relative to data centers served by utilities that can provide less expensive power even if we have additional space available for lease at any one of our data centers our ability to lease this space to existing or new customers could be constrained by our ability to provide sufficient electrical power as current and future customers increase their power footprint in our facilities over time the corresponding reduction in available power could limit our ability to increase occupancy rates or network density within our existing facilities furthermore at certain of our data centers our aggregate maximum contractual obligation to provide power and cooling to our customers may exceed the physical capacity at such data centers if customers were to quickly increase their demand for power and cooling if we are not able to increase the available power andor cooling or move the customer to another location within our data centers with sufficient power and cooling to meet such demand we could lose the customer as well as be exposed to liability under our leases in addition our power and cooling systems are difficult and expensive to upgrade accordingly we may not be able to efficiently upgrade or change these systems to meet new demands without incurring significant costs that we may not be able to pass on to our customers any such material loss of customers liability or additional costs could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we may be vulnerable to breaches or unauthorized access to or disruption of our physical and information security infrastructure and systems any of which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations security breaches or disruption of our or our customers physical or information technology infrastructure networks and related management systems could result in among other things unauthorized access to our facilities a breach of our and our customers’ networks and information technology infrastructure the misappropriation of our or our customers’ or their customers’ proprietary or confidential information interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers’ operations delays or interruptions to our ability to meet customer needs breach of our legal regulatory or contractual obligations inability to access or rely upon critical business records or other disruptions in our operations we may be required to expend significant financial resources to protect against or to remediate such security breaches we may not be able to implement security measures in a timely manner or if and when implemented these measures could be circumvented any breaches that may occur could expose  table of contents index to financial statements us to increased risk of lawsuits material monetary damages potential violations of applicable privacy and other laws penalties and fines loss of existing or potential customers harm to our reputation and increases in our security and insurance costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although our customers’ computing equipment resides in our buildings we do not have access to nor do we have knowledge of what data is being housed and processed on their equipment  in the event of a breach resulting in loss of data such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws we may be liable for damages fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks despite not handling the data  further the regulatory framework around data custody data privacy and breaches varies by jurisdiction and is an evolving area of law  we may not be able to limit our liability or damages in the event of such a loss illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition because real estate investments are relatively illiquid and because there may be even fewer buyers for our specialized real estate our ability to promptly sell properties in our portfolio in response to adverse changes in their performance may be limited which may harm our financial condition further digital realty trust inc is subject to provisions in the code that limit a reit’s ability to dispose of properties which limitations are not applicable to other types of real estate companies see “risks related to our organizational structure—tax consequences upon sale or refinancing” while digital realty trust inc has exclusive authority under digital realty trust lp’s limited partnership agreement to determine whether when and on what terms to sell a property any such decision would require the approval of digital realty trust inc’s board of directors these limitations may affect our ability to sell properties this lack of liquidity and the code restrictions may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and as a result could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow cash available for distribution and ability to access capital necessary to meet our debt payments and other obligations we could incur significant costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters including existing conditions at some of our properties under various laws relating to the protection of the environment a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at a property and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at or emanating from a property such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of the contaminants and the liability may be joint and several the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  or cercla established a regulatory and remedial program intended to provide for the investigation and cleanup of facilities where or from which a release of any hazardous substance into the environment has occurred or is threatened cercla’s primary mechanism for remedying such problems is to impose strict joint and several liability for cleanup of facilities on current owners and operators of the site former owners and operators of the site at the time of the disposal of the hazardous substances any person who arranges for the transportation disposal or treatment of the hazardous substances and the transporters who select the disposal and treatment facilities regardless of the care exercised by such persons cercla also imposes liability for the cost of evaluating and remedying any damage to natural resources the costs of cercla investigation and cleanup can be very substantial cercla also authorizes the imposition of a lien in favor of the united states on all real property subject to or affected by a remedial action for all costs for which a party is liable subject to certain procedural restrictions cercla gives a responsible party the right to bring a contribution action against other responsible parties for their allocable shares of investigative and remedial costs our ability to obtain reimbursement from others for their allocable shares of such costs would be limited by our ability to find other responsible parties and prove the extent of their responsibility their financial resources and other procedural requirements various state laws also impose strict joint and several liability for investigation cleanup and other damages associated with hazardous substance releases previous owners used some of our properties for industrial and retail purposes so those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination independent environmental consultants have conducted phase i or similar environmental site assessments on all of the properties in our portfolio site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties these assessments do not generally include soil samplings subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey and the assessments may fail to reveal all environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns in addition material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after these reviews were completed or may arise in the future we could be held jointly and severally liable under cercla and various state laws for the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination caused by  table of contents index to financial statements previous owners or operators fuel storage tanks are present at most of our properties and if releases were to occur we may be liable for the costs of cleaning any resulting contamination the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to thirdparty liability or materially adversely affect our ability to sell lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral in addition some of our tenants particularly those in the biotechnology and life sciences industry and those in the technology manufacturing industry routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties environmental laws and regulations subject our tenants and potentially us to liability resulting from these activities or from previous industrial or retail uses of those properties we could be held jointly and severally liable under cercla and various state laws for the investigation and remediation of hazardous substances released by our tenants environmental liabilities could also affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us we cannot assure you that costs of investigation and remediation of environmental matters will not affect our ability to pay dividends to digital realty trust inc’s stockholders and distributions to digital realty trust lp’s unitholders or that such costs or other remedial measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations some of the properties may contain asbestoscontaining building materials environmental laws require that asbestoscontaining building materials be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements these laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestoscontaining building materials our properties and their uses often require permits from various government agencies including permits related to zoning and land use such as permits to operate data center facilities certain permits from state or local environmental regulatory agencies including regulators of air quality are usually required to install and operate dieselpowered generators which provide emergency backup power at most of our facilities these permits often set emissions limits for certain air pollutants including oxides of nitrogen in addition various federal state and local environmental health and safety requirements such as fire requirements and treated and storm water discharge requirements apply to some of our properties changes to applicable regulations such as air quality regulations or the permit requirements for equipment at our facilities could hinder or prevent our construction or operation of data center facilities also drought conditions in certain markets have resulted in water usage restrictions and proposals to further restrict water usage  our data center facilities could face restrictions on water usage water efficiency mandates or higher water prices the environmental laws and regulations to which our properties are subject may change in the future and new laws and regulations may be created future laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability such laws include those directly regulating our climate change impacts and those which regulate the climate change impacts of companies with which we do business such as utilities providing our facilities with electricity see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — factors which may influence future results of operations — climate change legislation” we do not know if or how the requirements will change but changes may require that we make significant unanticipated expenditures and such expenditures may materially adversely impact our financial condition cash flow results cash available for distributions common stock’s per share trading price our competitive position and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs to remedy the problem when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold may grow particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen viruses and bacteria indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation in addition the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants employees of our tenants and others if property damage or health concerns arise we may incur significant costs complying with the americans with disabilities act and similar laws under the americans with disabilities act of  or the ada all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our  table of contents index to financial statements properties to determine our compliance with the ada if one or more of the properties in our portfolio does not comply with the ada then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance additional federal state and local laws also may require modifications to our properties or restrict our ability to renovate our properties we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada and any other similar legislation or are subject to awards of damages to private litigants our financial condition results of operations cash flow cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected we may incur significant costs complying with other regulations the properties in our portfolio are subject to various federal state and local regulations such as state and local fire and life safety regulations if we fail to comply with these various regulations we may have to pay fines or damage awards to private litigants in addition we do not know whether existing regulations will change or whether future regulations will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will materially adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flow cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations our business could be adversely impacted if there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting the design and

inc owns a controlling interest in our operating partnership any conflict that cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either digital realty trust inc’s stockholders or the limited partners will be resolved in favor of digital realty trust inc’s stockholders the provisions of maryland law that allow the fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been tested in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict digital realty trust inc’s fiduciary duties digital realty trust inc’s stockholders and digital realty trust lp’s unitholders are also subject to the following additional conflict of interest tax consequences upon sale or refinancing sales of properties and repayment of certain indebtedness will affect holders of common units in our operating partnership and digital realty trust inc’s stockholders differently consequently these holders of common units in our operating partnership may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and  table of contents index to financial statements timing of any such sale or repayment of debt while digital realty trust inc has exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether when and on what terms to sell a property any such decision generally would require the approval of digital realty trust inc’s board of directors certain of digital realty trust inc’s directors and executive officers could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some or a majority of digital realty trust lp’s unitholders including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness digital realty trust inc’s charter digital realty trust lp’s partnership agreement and maryland law contain provisions

holder of common units will receive or have the right to elect to receive the greatest amount of cash securities or other property which such holder would have received if it exercised its right to redemption and received shares of digital realty trust inc common stock in exchange for its common units immediately prior to the expiration of such purchase tender or exchange offer and thereupon accepted such purchase tender or exchange offer and the transaction was then consummated or • the following conditions are met • substantially all of the assets directly or indirectly owned by the

securities with an exchange ratio based on the determination of relative fair market value of such securities and the shares of digital realty trust inc common stock these provisions may discourage others from trying to acquire control of digital realty trust inc and may delay defer or prevent a change of control transaction that might be beneficial to digital realty trust inc’s stockholders and digital realty trust lp’s unitholders the change of control conversion features of digital realty trust inc’s preferred stock may make it more difficult for a party to take over our company or discourage a party from taking over our company upon the occurrence of specified change of control transactions holders of our series f preferred stock series g preferred stock series h preferred stock and series i preferred stock will have the right unless prior to the change of control conversion date we have provided or provide notice of our election to redeem such preferred stock to

alternative consideration subject to caps set forth in the articles supplementary governing the applicable series of preferred stock the change of control conversion features of the series f preferred stock series g preferred stock series h preferred stock and series i preferred stock may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of

g preferred stock series h preferred stock and series i preferred stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thencurrent market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests digital realty trust inc could increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of stock and issue stock without stockholder approval digital realty trust inc’s charter authorizes the company’s board of directors without stockholder approval to amend the charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock or the number of authorized shares of stock of any class or series to issue authorized but unissued shares of the company’s common stock or preferred stock and subject to the voting rights of holders of preferred stock to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of the company’s common stock or preferred stock into other classes of series of stock and to set the preferences rights and other terms of such classified or reclassified shares although digital realty trust inc’s board of directors has no such intention at the present time it could establish an additional class or series of preferred stock that could depending on the terms of such class or series delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might be in the best interest of digital realty trust inc’s stockholders and digital realty trust lp’s unitholders certain provisions of maryland law could inhibit changes in control certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law or mgcl may have the effect of impeding a third party from making a proposal to acquire digital realty trust inc or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could be in the best interests of digital realty trust inc’s stockholders and digital realty trust lp’s unitholders including • “business combination” provisions that subject to limitations prohibit certain business combinations between digital realty trust inc and an “interested stockholder” defined generally as any person who beneficially owns directly or indirectly  or more of the voting power of the company’s outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the company who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of  or more of the voting power of the company’s then outstanding shares of stock or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and thereafter imposes special appraisal rights and supermajority voting requirements on these combinations and • “control share” provisions that provide that “control shares” of digital realty trust inc defined as shares which when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy  table of contents index to financial statements entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors acquired in a “control share acquisition” defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding “control shares” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the company’s stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding all interested shares digital realty trust inc has opted out of these provisions of the mgcl in the case of the business combination provisions of the mgcl by resolution of its board of directors and in the case of the control share provisions of the mgcl pursuant to a provision in its bylaws however digital realty trust inc’s board of directors may by resolution elect to opt in to the business combination provisions of the mgcl and the company may by amendment to its bylaws opt in to the control share provisions of the mgcl in the future the provisions of digital realty trust inc’s charter on removal of directors and the advance notice provisions of digital realty trust inc’s bylaws could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of the company that might be in the best interest of digital realty trust inc’s stockholders and digital realty trust lp’s unitholders likewise if digital realty trust inc’s board of directors were to opt in to the business combination provisions of the mgcl or the provisions of title  subtitle  of the mgcl not currently applicable to the company or if the provision in the digital realty trust inc’s bylaws opting out of the control share acquisition provisions of the mgcl were rescinded these provisions of the mgcl could have similar antitakeover effects the conversion rights of digital realty trust inc’s preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of digital realty trust inc’s common stock digital realty trust inc currently has  shares of  series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock outstanding  shares of  series g cumulative redeemable preferred stock outstanding  shares of  series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock outstanding and  shares of  series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock outstanding which may be converted into digital realty trust inc common stock upon the occurrence of limited specified change in control transactions the conversion of the series f preferred stock series g preferred stock series h preferred stock or series i preferred stock for digital realty trust inc common stock would dilute stockholder ownership in digital realty trust inc and unitholder ownership in digital realty trust lp and could adversely affect the market price of digital realty trust inc common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities digital realty trust inc’s board of directors may change our investment and financing policies without stockholder approval or approval of digital realty trust lp’s other partners and we may become more highly leveraged which may increase our risk of default under our debt obligations digital realty trust inc’s board of directors adopted a policy limiting our indebtedness to  of our total enterprise value our total enterprise value is defined as the sum of the market value of digital realty trust inc’s outstanding common stock which may decrease thereby increasing our debt to total capitalization ratio excluding options issued under our incentive award plans plus the aggregate value of digital realty trust lp units not held by digital realty trust inc with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of digital realty trust inc common stock and excluding longterm incentive units and class c units plus the liquidation preference of digital realty trust inc’s outstanding preferred stock plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness however the organizational documents of digital realty trust inc and digital realty trust lp do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness funded or otherwise that we may incur digital realty trust inc’s board of directors may alter or eliminate our current policy on borrowing at any time without stockholder or unitholder approval if this policy changed we could become more highly leveraged which could result in an increase in our debt service and which could materially adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends to digital realty trust inc’s stockholders or distributions to digital realty trust lp’s unitholders higher leverage also increases the risk of default on our obligations digital realty trust inc’s rights and the rights of its stockholders to take action against its directors and officers are limited maryland law provides that digital realty trust inc’s directors have no liability in their capacities as directors if they perform their duties in good faith in a manner they reasonably believe to be in the company’s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances as permitted by the mgcl digital realty trust inc’s charter limits the liability of the company’s directors and officers to the company and its stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from  table of contents index to financial statements • actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money property or services or • a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated in addition digital realty trust inc’s charter authorizes the company to obligate itself and the company’s bylaws require it to indemnify the company’s directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities and to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law and digital realty trust inc has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors as a result digital realty trust inc and its stockholders may have more limited rights against its directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law accordingly in the event that actions taken in good faith by any of digital realty trust inc’s directors or officers impede the performance of the company the company’s stockholders’ ability to recover damages from that director or officer will be limited risks related to taxes and digital realty trust inc’s status as a reit failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to digital realty trust inc and its stockholders and to digital realty trust lp and its unitholders digital realty trust inc has operated and intends to continue operating in a manner that it believes will allow it to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code digital realty trust inc has not requested and does not plan to request a ruling from the irs that it qualifies as a reit qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code is greater in the case of a reit that like digital realty trust inc holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within digital realty trust inc’s control may affect its ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit digital realty trust inc must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the ownership of its stock requirements regarding the composition of its assets and a requirement that at least  of its gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources such as “rents from real property” also digital realty trust inc must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least  of its net taxable income excluding any net capital gains if digital realty trust inc loses its reit status it will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce its cash available for distribution including cash available to pay dividends to its stockholders for each of the years involved because • digital realty trust inc would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates • digital realty trust inc also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and • unless digital realty trust inc is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions it could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which it was disqualified in addition if digital realty trust inc fails to qualify as a reit it will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and accordingly distributions digital realty trust lp makes to its unitholders could be similarly reduced as a result of all these factors digital realty trust inc’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would materially adversely affect the value of digital realty trust inc’s stock and digital realty trust lp’s units in certain circumstances digital realty trust inc may be subject to federal and state taxes as a reit which would reduce its cash available for distribution to its stockholders even if digital realty trust inc qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes it may be subject to some federal state and local taxes on its income or property and in certain cases a  penalty tax in the event it sells property as a dealer in addition our domestic corporate subsidiary digital services inc which is a taxable reit subsidiary of digital realty trust inc could be subject to federal and state taxes and our foreign properties and companies are subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which they operate and are located any federal state or other taxes digital realty trust inc pays will reduce its cash available for distribution to stockholders  table of contents index to financial statements to maintain digital realty trust inc’s reit status we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions to qualify as a reit digital realty trust inc generally must distribute to its stockholders at least  of its net taxable income each year excluding capital gains and digital realty trust inc will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that it distributes less than  of its net taxable income each year in addition digital realty trust inc will be subject to a  nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by digital realty trust inc in any calendar year are less than the sum of  of its ordinary income  of its capital gain net income and  of its undistributed income from prior years while historically digital realty trust inc has satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to its stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property we may need to borrow funds for digital realty trust inc to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends income from “qualified dividends” payable to us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates are generally subject to tax at preferential rates dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends payable by reits to the extent that the preferential rates continue to apply to regular corporate qualified dividends investors who are individuals trusts and estates may perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including the per share trading price of digital realty trust inc’s capital stock the tax imposed on reits engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes a reit’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a  penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes digital realty trust inc must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things its sources of income the nature and diversification of its assets including its proportionate share of digital realty trust lp’s assets the amounts it distributes to its stockholders and the ownership of its capital stock if digital realty trust inc fails to comply with one or more of the asset tests at the end of any calendar quarter it must correct the failure within  days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego investments we might otherwise make or to liquidate otherwise attractive investments thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our performance and reduce amounts available for distribution to digital realty trust inc’s stockholders and digital realty trust lp’s unitholders legislative or other actions could have a negative effect on our stockholders or us the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect digital realty trust inc’s stockholders digital realty trust lp’s unitholders and us we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors and us new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect digital realty trust inc’s ability to qualify as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us moreover the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit  table of contents index to financial statements tax liabilities and attributes inherited in connection with acquisitions may adversely impact our business  from time to time we may acquire other corporations or entities and in connection with such acquisitions we may succeed to the historic tax attributes and liabilities of such entities for example if we acquire a c corporation and subsequently dispose of its assets within five years of the acquisition we could be required to pay tax on any builtin gain attributable to such assets determined as of the date on which we acquired the assets in addition in order to qualify as a reit at the end of any taxable year we must not have any earnings and profits accumulated in a nonreit year as a result if we acquire a c corporation we must distribute the corporation’s earnings and profits accumulated prior to the acquisition before the end of the taxable year in which we acquire the corporation we also could be required to pay the acquired entity’s unpaid taxes even though such liabilities arose prior to the time we acquired the entity telx was a c corporation at the time of the telx acquisition which raises each of these issues changes in us or foreign tax laws regulations including changes to tax rates may adversely affect our results of operations we are headquartered in the us with subsidiaries and operations globally and are subject to income taxes in these jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes although we believe that we have adequately assessed and accounted for our potential tax liabilities and that our tax estimates are reasonable there can be no assurance that additional taxes will not be due upon audit of our tax returns or as a result of changes to applicable tax laws  the us government as well as the governments of many of the countries in which we operate are actively discussing changes to the corporate recognition and taxation of worldwide income the nature and timing of any changes to each jurisdiction’s tax laws and the impact on our future tax liabilities cannot be predicted with any accuracy but could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows additionally each of our properties is subject to real property and personal property taxes these taxes may increase as tax rates change and as the properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities any increase in property taxes on our properties could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations the power of digital realty trust inc’s board of directors to revoke digital realty trust inc’s reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to digital realty trust inc’s stockholders and digital realty trust lp’s unitholders digital realty trust inc’s charter provides that its board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate its reit election without the approval of its stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in digital realty trust inc’s best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if digital realty trust inc ceases to qualify as a reit it would become subject to us federal income tax on its taxable income and it would no longer be required to distribute most of its taxable income to its stockholders and accordingly distributions digital realty trust lp makes to its unitholders

which may influence future results of operations global market and economic conditions general economic conditions and the cost and availability of capital may be adversely affected in some or all of the metropolitan areas in which we own properties and conduct our operations in june  a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum the referendum was advisory and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the united kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process nevertheless the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union and has given rise to calls for the governments of other european union member states to consider withdrawal instability in the us european asia pacific and other international financial markets and economies may adversely affect our ability and the ability of our tenants to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may result in adverse effects on our and our tenants’ financial condition and results of operations in addition our access to funds under our global revolving credit facility depends on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us we cannot assure you that longterm disruptions in the global economy and the return of tighter credit conditions among and potential failures or nationalizations of third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse effect on our lenders if our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to us our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected if we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow additional funds access our existing lines of credit or raise equity or debt capital we may need to source alternative ways to increase our liquidity such alternatives may include without limitation curtailing development activity disposing of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms or entering into or renewing leases on less favorable terms than we otherwise would foreign currency exchange risk for the years ended december   and    we had foreign operations in the united kingdom ireland france the netherlands germany switzerland canada singapore australia japan and hong kong and as such are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements of foreign currencies which may affect future costs and cash flows our foreign operations are conducted in the british pound sterling euro swiss franc canadian dollar singapore dollar australian dollar japanese yen and the hong kong dollar our primary currency exposures are to the british pound sterling the euro and the singapore dollar the possible exit of the united kingdom or any other country from the european union or prolonged periods of uncertainty relating to any of these possibilities could result in increased foreign currency exchange volatility we attempt to mitigate a portion of the risk of currency fluctuation by financing our investments in the local currency denominations although there can be no assurance that this will be effective as a result changes in the relation of any such foreign currency to us dollars may affect our revenues operating margins and distributions and may also affect the book value of our assets and the amount of stockholders’ equity rental income  the amount of rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends on several factors including our ability to maintain or improve the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations excluding approximately  million square feet of space under active development and approximately  million square feet of space held for future development as of december    the occupancy rate of the properties in our portfolio including the  properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was approximately  of our net rentable square feet as of december    we had over  tenants in our portfolio including the  properties held in our managed portfolio of unconsolidated joint ventures as of december    approximately  of our leases on a rentable square footage basis contained base rent escalations that were either fixed generally ranging from  to  or indexed based on a consumer price index or other similar inflation related index we cannot assure you that these escalations will cover any increases in our costs or will otherwise keep rental rates at or above market rates the amount of rental income we generate also depends on maintaining or increasing rental rates at our properties which in turn depends on several factors including supply and demand and market rates for data center space included in our approximately  million net rentable square feet excluding space under active development and space held for future development and  properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures at december   is approximately  million square feet of data center space with extensive installed tenant improvements available for lease since our ipo we have leased over  million square feet of similar space including turnkey flex ® space our turnkey flex ® product is an effective solution for tenants who prefer to utilize a partner with the expertise or capital budget to provide extensive data center infrastructure and security our expertise in data center construction and operations enables us to lease space to these tenants at a premium over other uses in addition as of december    we had approximately  million square feet of space under active development and approximately  million square feet of space held for future development or approximately  of the total rentable space in our portfolio including the  properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures our  table of contents index to financial statements ability to grow earnings depends in part on our ability to develop space and lease development space at favorable rates which we may not be able to obtain development space requires significant capital investment in order to develop data center facilities that are ready for use and in addition we may require additional time or encounter delays in securing tenants for development space we may purchase additional vacant properties and properties with vacant development space in the future we will require additional capital to finance our development activities which may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us including as a result of the conditions described above under “global market and economic conditions” in addition the timing between when we sign a new lease with a tenant and when that lease commences and we begin to generate rental income may be significant and may not be easily predictable certain leases may provide for staggered commencement dates for additional space the timing of which may be delayed significantly economic downturns including as a result of the conditions described above under “global market and economic conditions” or regional downturns affecting our metropolitan areas or downturns in the technologyrelated real estate industry that impair our ability to lease or renew or release space or otherwise reduce returns on our investments or the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments as in the case of tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties scheduled lease expirations our ability to release expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations in addition to approximately  million square feet of available space in our portfolio which excludes approximately  million square feet of space under active development and approximately  million square feet of space held for future development as of december   and the two properties held as investments in our nonmanaged unconsolidated joint ventures leases representing approximately  and  of the net rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending december   and

space our ability to release or renew expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations we continue to see strong demand in most of our key metropolitan areas for data center space and subject to the supply of available data center space in these metropolitan areas expect the rental rates we are likely to achieve on released or renewed data center space leases for  expirations on an average aggregate basis will generally be higher than the rates currently being paid for the same space on a gaap basis and flat on a cash basis for the year ended december    rents on renewed space increased by an average of  on a gaap basis on our turnkey flex® space compared to the expiring rents and increased by an average of  on a gaap

properties will be released at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates further releasedrenewed rental rates in a particular metropolitan area may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio as a whole and may fluctuate from one period to another due to a number of factors including local real estate conditions local supply and demand for data center space competition from other data center developers or operators the condition of the property and whether the property or space within the property has been developed geographic concentration we depend on the market for data centers in specific geographic regions and significant changes in these regional metropolitan areas can impact our future results as of december    our portfolio

ended december   was approximately  million operating expenses our operating expenses generally consist of utilities property and ad valorem taxes property management fees insurance and site maintenance costs as well as rental expenses on our ground and building leases in particular our buildings require significant power to support the data center operations contained in them many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for all or a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us however we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses other than utility expense and real estate taxes under our leases for turnkey flex® facilities we also incur general and administrative expenses including expenses relating to our asset management function as well as significant legal accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance sec reporting and compliance with the various provisions of the sarbanesoxley  table of contents index to financial statements act increases or decreases in such operating expenses will impact our overall performance we expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand climate change legislation in june  the us house of representatives approved comprehensive clean energy and climate change legislation intended to cut greenhouse gas or ghg emissions via a capandtrade program the us senate did not subsequently pass similar legislation new climate change legislation was introduced in the us senate in  but significant opposition to federal climate change legislation exists in the absence of comprehensive federal climate change legislation over the past several years regulatory agencies primarily the us environmental protection agency or epa and states took the lead in regulating ghg emissions in the us under the obama administration epa moved aggressively to regulate ghg emissions from automobiles and large stationary sources including electricity producers using its own authority under the clean air act the trump administration has signaled that it intends to eliminate or modify certain of the epa’s ghg emissions regulations and refocus epa’s mission away from such regulation the epa made an endangerment finding in  that allows it to create regulations imposing emissions reporting permitting control technology installation and monitoring requirements applicable to certain emitters of ghgs including facilities that provide electricity to our data centers although the materiality of the impacts will not be fully known until all regulations are finalized and legal challenges are resolved under the obama administration the epa finalized rules imposing permitting and control technology requirements upon certain newlyconstructed or modified facilities which emit ghgs under the clean air act new source review prevention of significant deterioration or nsr psd and title v permitting programs as a result newlyissued nsr psd and title v permits for new or modified electricity generating units egus and other facilities may need to address ghg emissions including by requiring the installation of “best available control technology” the epa implemented in december  the “clean power plan” regulating carbon dioxide co emissions from new and existing coalfired and natural gas egus existing egus are subject to statewide co emissions reduction targets an effort designed to achieve a thirtytwo percent reduction in nationwide existing egu co emissions by  in comparison to  levels new modified and reconstructed egus are subject to “new source performance standards” that include both technological requirements and numeric emission limits however twentyfour states and a number of industry groups challenged the clean power plan in federal court and in february  the us supreme court issued a stay of the clean power plan until the legal challenges have been decided further president trump has voiced opposition to the clean power plan and he could seek to eliminate it separately the epa’s ghg “reporting rule” requires that certain emitters including electricity generators monitor and report ghg emissions the trump administration may seek to revise or reverse these regulations as a result states may drive nearterm regulation to reduce ghg emissions in the united states at the state level california implemented a ghg capandtrade program that began imposing compliance obligations on industrial sectors including electricity generators and importers in january  in september  california adopted legislation calling for a further reduction in ghg emissions to  below  levels by  outside the united states the european union or eu including the united kingdom has been operating since  under a capandtrade program which directly affects the largest emitters of ghgs including electricity producers from whom we purchase power and the eu has taken a number of other climate changerelated initiatives including a directive targeted at improving energy efficiency which introduces energy efficiency auditing requirements  the paris agreement which was adopted by the united states and  other countries and looks to prevent global average temperatures from increasing by more than  degrees celsius above preindustrial levels officially went into force on november   however president trump has signaled that he may withdraw the united states from the paris agreement national legislation may also be implemented independently by members of the eu  for example in the united kingdom the implementation of the crc energy efficiency scheme introduced a mandatory reporting and pricing scheme that is designed to incentivize energy efficiency and cut emissions by large energy users it is not yet clear how brexit will impact the united kingdom’s or the eu’s approach to climate change regulation in canada the first compliance period under ontario’s ghg capandtrade program began in january  climate change regulations are in various stages of implementation in other nations as well including nations where we operate such as australia where a ghg emissions cap was implemented in  the cost of electric power comprises a significant component of our operating expenses any additional taxation or regulation of energy use including as a result of i new legislation that congress may pass ii the regulations that the epa has proposed or finalized iii regulations under legislation that states have passed or may pass or iv any further legislation or regulations in the eu or other regions where we operate could significantly increase our costs and we may not be able to effectively pass all of these costs on to our tenants these matters could adversely impact our business results of operations or financial condition  table of contents index to financial statements interest rates  as of december    we had approximately  billion of variable rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements on certain tranches of our unsecured term loan along with  million and  million of variable rate debt that was outstanding on the  global revolving credit facility and the unswapped portion of the  unsecured term loan respectively the availability of debt and equity capital may decrease or be on unfavorable terms as a result of the circumstances described above under “global market and economic conditions” or other factors the effects on commercial real estate mortgages if available include but may not be limited to higher loan spreads tightened loan covenants reduced loantovalue ratios resulting in lower borrower proceeds and higher principal payments potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and fixed charges and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations potentially impacting our future access to the debt and equity capital markets increased interest rates may also increase the risk that the counterparties to our swap agreements will default on their obligations which could further increase our interest expense if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist satisfy our debt service obligations or pay the cash dividends to digital realty trust inc’s stockholders necessary to maintain its qualification as a reit demand for data center space  our portfolio of properties consists primarily of data centers a decrease in the demand for or increase in supply of data center space internet gateway facilities or other technologyrelated real estate would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a portfolio with a more diversified tenant base or less specialized use we have invested in building out additional inventory primarily in what we anticipate will be our active major metropolitan areas prior to having executed leases with respect to this space we believe that demand in key metropolitan areas such as northern virginia dallas and chicago is largely in line with supply we also continue to see strong demand in other key metropolitan areas across our portfolio however until this inventory is leased up which will depend on a number of factors including available data center space in these metropolitan areas our return on invested capital is negatively impacted our development activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns including recessions and the other circumstances described above under “global market and economic conditions” as well as adverse developments in the data center internet and data communications and broader technology industries any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate it spending or reduced demand for data center space reduced demand could also result from business relocations including to metropolitan areas that we do not currently serve changes in industry practice or in technology such as virtualization technology more efficient computing or networking devices or devices that require higher power densities than today’s devices could also reduce demand for the physical data center space we provide or make the tenant improvements in our facilities obsolete or in need of significant upgrades to remain viable in addition the development of new technologies the adoption of new industry standards or other factors could render many of our tenants’ current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and contribute to a downturn in their businesses thereby increasing the likelihood that they default under their leases become insolvent or file for bankruptcy in addition demand for data center space in our properties or the rates at which we lease space may be adversely impacted either across our portfolio or in specific metropolitan areas as a result of an increase in the number of competitors or the amount of space being offered in our metropolitan areas and other metropolitan areas by our competitors telx and european portfolio acquisitions we believe that the acquisitions of telx and the european portfolio will provide a number of strategic and financial benefits including providing us a leading colocation and interconnection platform a premium connectivity infrastructure and enhanced growth potential in attractive locations however there can be no assurance that we will realize the intended benefits of the telx acquisition and the european portfolio acquisition and they may divert managements attention and disrupt our plans and operations in addition we may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to telx and the european portfolio for which we may have no or limited recourse against the sellers critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period our actual results may differ from these estimates we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in item  note  “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date on the front cover of this report  table of contents index to financial statements investments in real estate acquisition of real estate the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the property and improvements the occupancy of the building the term and rate of inplace leases the creditworthiness of the tenants favorable or unfavorable financing above or belowmarket ground leases and numerous other factors accordingly we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the identifiable assets including intangibles and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair value of such assets and liabilities this includes determining the value of the property and improvements land ground leases if any and tenant improvements additionally we evaluate the value of inplace leases on occupancy and market rent the value of the tenant relationships the value or negative value of above or below market leases any debt or deferred taxes assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us and any building leases assumed from the seller each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations for example if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount if we were to allocate more value to the property as opposed to allocating to the value of inplace tenant leases this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time this potential effect occurs because the amounts allocated to property are depreciated over the estimated lives of the property whereas amounts allocated to inplace tenant leases are amortized over the estimated term including renewal and extension assumptions of the leases additionally the amortization of the value or negative value assigned to above or below market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of inplace tenant leases and tenant relationships which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated income statements from time to time we will receive offers for sale of our properties either solicited or unsolicited for those offers that are accepted the prospective buyer will usually require a due diligence period before consummation of the transaction it is not unusual for matters to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process we classify real estate as “held for sale” when all criteria under the gaap guidance have been met capitalization of costs direct and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the development of properties are capitalized as incurred project costs include all costs directly associated with the development of a property including construction costs interest property taxes insurance legal fees and costs of personnel working on the project indirect costs that do not clearly relate to the projects under development are not capitalized and are charged to expense as incurred capitalization of costs begins when the activities necessary to get the development project ready for its intended use begin which include costs incurred before the beginning of construction capitalization of costs ceases when the development project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use determining when a development project commences and when it is substantially complete and ready for its intended use involves a degree of judgment we generally consider a development project to be substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy if and when development of a property is suspended pursuant to a formal change in the planned use of the property we will evaluate whether the accumulated costs exceed the estimated value of the project and write off the amount of any such excess accumulated costs for a development project that is suspended for reasons other than a formal change in the planned use of such property the accumulated project costs are evaluated for impairment consistent with our impairment policies for longlived assets capitalized costs are allocated to the specific components of a project that are benefited useful lives of assets we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis asset impairment evaluation we review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of the property a change in the expected holding period for the property a significant adverse change in how the property is being used or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of the property or a history of operating or cash flow losses of the property when such impairment indicators exist we review an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment’s use and eventual disposition and compare that estimate to the carrying value of the property we consider factors such as future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand competition and other factors if our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an  table of contents index to financial statements impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods since cash flows on properties considered to be longlived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether the carrying value of a property is recoverable our strategy of holding properties over the longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable and therefore requiring the recording of an impairment loss if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material if we determine that the asset fails the recoverability test the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value we generally estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues expenses and capital improvement costs that a market participant would use based on the highest and best use of the asset which is similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers in certain cases we may supplement this analysis by obtaining outside broker opinions of value revenue recognition rental revenue is recognized using the straightline method over the terms of the tenant leases deferred rents included in our consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized to date on a straightline basis versus the contractual rental payments under the terms of the leases many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us however we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses other than utility expense and real estate taxes under our leases for turnkey flex® facilities such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred lease termination fees are recognized over the remaining term of the lease effective as of the date the lease modification is finalized assuming collection is not considered doubtful as discussed above we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above or belowmarket tenant leases as a reduction of rental revenue in the case of abovemarket leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of belowmarket leases we must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to minimum rent deferred rent expense reimbursements lease termination fees and other income we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts tenant concentrations tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts these estimates have a direct impact on our net revenue because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net revenue and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net revenue for a particular period sharebased awards we recognize compensation expense related to sharebased awards we generally amortize this compensation expense over the vesting period of the award the calculation of the fair value of sharebased awards is subjective and requires several assumptions over such items as expected stock volatility dividend payments and future company results these assumptions have a direct impact on our net income because a higher sharebased awards amount would result in lower net income for a particular period  table of contents index to financial statements results of operations the discussion below relates to our financial

the operating partnership” section below the term our “parent company” refers to digital realty trust inc on an unconsolidated basis excluding our operating partnership analysis of liquidity and capital resources our parent company’s business is operated primarily through our operating partnership of which our parent company is the sole general partner and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes because our parent company operates on a consolidated basis with our operating partnership the section entitled “liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership” should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of our parent company on a consolidated basis and how our company is operated as a whole our parent company issues public equity from time to time but generally does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by our operating partnership our parent company itself does not hold any indebtedness other than guarantees of the indebtedness of our operating partnership and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates and an intercompany loan that was made and repaid in  and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of our operating partnership therefore the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of our parent company and our operating partnership are the same on their respective financial statements except for immaterial differences related to cash other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by our parent company and an intercompany loan that was made and repaid during  however all debt other than the intercompany loan is held directly or indirectly at our operating partnership level our parent company’s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred stock our parent company’s principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from our operating partnership as the sole general partner of our operating partnership our parent company has the full exclusive and complete responsibility for our operating partnership’s daytoday management and control our parent company causes our operating partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as our parent company may in its discretion determine in the manner provided in our operating partnership’s partnership agreement our parent company receives proceeds from its equity issuances from time to time but is generally required by our operating partnership’s partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to our operating partnership in exchange for partnership units of our operating partnership our parent company is a wellknown seasoned issuer with an effective shelf registration statement filed on april   which allows our parent company to register an unspecified amount of various classes of equity securities as circumstances warrant our parent company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis dependent upon market conditions and available pricing any proceeds from such equity issuances would be generally contributed to our operating partnership in exchange for additional equity interests in our operating partnership our operating partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties to fund development opportunities and for general working capital purposes including potentially for the repurchase redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or equity securities the liquidity of our parent company is dependent on our operating partnership’s ability to make sufficient distributions to our parent company the primary cash requirement of our parent company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders our parent company also guarantees our operating partnership’s as well as certain of its subsidiaries’ and affiliates’ unsecured debt if our operating partnership or such subsidiaries fail to fulfill their debt requirements which trigger parent  table of contents index to financial statements company guarantee obligations then our parent company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees however our parent company’s only material asset is its investment in our operating partnership we believe our operating partnership’s sources of working capital specifically its cash flow from operations and funds available under its  global revolving credit facility are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to our parent company and in turn for our parent company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders however we cannot assure you that our operating partnership’s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs including making distribution payments to our parent company the lack of availability of capital could adversely affect our operating partnership’s ability to pay its distributions to our parent company which would in turn adversely affect our parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders on june   digital realty trust inc entered into equity distribution agreements which

may from time to time seek to retire redeem or repurchase its equity or the debt securities of our operating partnership through cash purchases andor exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases redemptions or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions or other factors the amounts involved may be material we are also subject to the commitments discussed below under “dividends and distributions” dividends and distributions our parent company is required to distribute  of its taxable income excluding capital gains on an annual basis in order for it to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes accordingly our parent company intends to make but is not contractually bound to make regular quarterly distributions to its common stockholders from cash flow from our operating partnership’s operating activities while historically our parent company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property all such distributions are at the discretion of our parent company’s board of directors our parent company considers market factors and our operating partnership’s performance in addition to reit requirements in determining distribution levels our parent company has distributed at least  of its taxable income annually since inception to minimize corporate level federal income taxes amounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders are invested primarily in interestbearing accounts and shortterm interestbearing securities which are consistent with our intention to maintain our parent company’s status as a reit as a result of this distribution requirement our operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not reits can our parent company may need to continue to raise capital in the debt and equity markets to fund our operating partnership’s working capital needs as well as potential developments at new or existing properties acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures in addition our parent company may be required to use borrowings under our  global revolving credit facility if necessary to meet reit distribution requirements and maintain our parent company’s reit status  table of contents index to financial

require discontinued operations presentation the growing acceptance by private institutional investors of the data center asset class has generally pushed capitalization rates lower as such private investors typically have lower return expectations than we do as a result we anticipate that nearterm acquisitions activity will comprise a smaller percentage of our growth until seller price

described above funds from operations we calculate funds from operations or ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property excluding a gain from a preexisting relationship impairment charges real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures management uses ffo as a supplemental performance measure because in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs we also believe that as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits however because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited other reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and accordingly our ffo may not be comparable to such other reits’ ffo accordingly ffo

accounting standards update or asu no  revenue from contracts with customers and since that date has issued several additional asus intended to clarify certain aspects of asu  and to provide for certain practical expedients entities can elect upon adoption collectively these asus outline a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers while lease contracts with customers which constitute the vast majority of our revenues are a specific scope exception this update may have implications in certain variable payment terms included in lease agreements the standard is effective for the company on january   with early adoption permitted the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method and permits the use of certain practical expedients we currently anticipate using the cumulative effect transition method however this determination is subject to change as the standard does not significantly impact lessor accounting we do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our accounting for rental revenue in addition we do not anticipate a significant impact to our accounting for certain of our revenue streams which are not based on contractually specified lease amounts including interconnection tenant reimbursement and other revenue in march  the fasb issued asu  “improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” which provides for simplification of certain aspects of employee sharebased payment accounting including income taxes classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows the amendments in this standard must be applied prospectively retrospectively or as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the year of adoption depending on the type of amendment we adopted asu  as of january   and it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in february  the fasb issued asu  leases topic  which sets out the principles for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract ie lessees and lessors the new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee this classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straightline basis over the term of the lease a lessee is also required to record a rightofuse asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than  months regardless of their classification accounting for leases with a term of  months or less will be similar to existing guidance for operating leases today the new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for salestype leases direct financing leases and operating leases asu  is expected to impact the company’s consolidated financial statements as the company has certain operating and land lease arrangements for which it is the lessee asu  supersedes the previous leases standard leases topic  the standard is effective on january   with early adoption permitted a set of practical expedients for implementation which must be elected as a package and for all leases may also be elected these practical expedients include relief from reassessing lease classification at the adoption date for expired or existing leases although a rightofuse asset and lease liability would still be recorded for such leases we are currently assessing the method of adoption and the impact that asu  will have on our consolidated financial statements in november  the fasb issued an asu that will require companies to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginningofperiod and endofperiod total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows the asu will require a disclosure of a reconciliation between the statement of financial position and the statement of cash flows when the statement of financial position includes more than one line item for cash cash equivalents restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents entities with material restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents balances will be required to disclose the nature of the restrictions the asu is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented as of december    and   we had   million  and   million  of restricted cash respectively in our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption of this asu restricted cash balances will be included along with cash and cash equivalents as of the end of period and beginning of period respectively in our consolidated statement of cash flows for all periods presented separate line items showing changes in restricted cash balances will be eliminated from our consolidated statement of

transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business asu  is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted the update

operating partnership and the subsidiaries of the operating partnership intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated the notes to the consolidated financial statements of digital realty trust inc and the operating partnership have been combined to provide the following benefits • enhancing investors’ understanding of the company and the operating partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business • eliminating duplicative disclosure and providing a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the company and the operating partnership and • creating time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one set of notes instead of two separate sets of notes there are few differences between the company and the operating partnership which are reflected in these consolidated financial statements we believe it is important to understand the differences between the company and the operating partnership in the context of how we operate as an interrelated consolidated company digital realty trust inc’s only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the operating partnership as a result digital realty trust inc generally does not conduct business itself other than acting as the sole general partner of the operating partnership issuing public securities from time to time and guaranteeing certain unsecured debt of the operating partnership and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates digital realty trust inc itself has not issued any indebtedness but guarantees the unsecured debt of the operating partnership and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates as disclosed in these notes the operating partnership holds substantially all the assets of the company and holds the ownership interests in the company’s joint ventures the operating partnership conducts the operations of the business and is

the operating partnership’s or its affiliates’ direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of partnership units the presentation of noncontrolling interests in operating

the common limited partnership interests held by the limited partners in the operating partnership are presented as limited partners’ capital within partners’ capital in the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in operating partnership within equity in digital realty trust inc’s consolidated financial statements the common and preferred partnership interests held by digital realty trust inc in the operating partnership are presented as general partner’s capital within partners’ capital in the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements and as preferred stock common stock additional paidin capital and accumulated dividends in excess of earnings within stockholders’ equity in digital realty trust inc’s consolidated financial statements the differences in the presentations between stockholders’ equity and partners’ capital result from the differences in the equity issued at the digital realty trust inc and the operating partnership levels to help investors understand the significant differences between the company and the operating partnership these consolidated financial statements present the following separate sections for each of the company and the operating partnership • consolidated face financial statements and • the following notes to the consolidated financial statements • debt of

classify an asset as held for sale once management has the authority to approve and commits to a plan to sell the asset is available for immediate sale an active program to locate a buyer has commenced and the sale of the asset is probable and transfer of the asset is expected to occur within one year upon the classification of assets as held for sale or sold the depreciation and amortization of the assets will cease d investment in unconsolidated joint ventures the company’s investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method whereby the investment is increased for capital contributed and our share of the joint ventures’ net income and decreased by distributions we receive and our share of any losses of the joint ventures we amortize the difference between the cost of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and the book value of the underlying equity into equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates on a straightline basis consistent with the lives of the underlying assets e impairment of longlived assets we review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of the property a change in the expected holding period for the property a significant adverse change in how the property is being used or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of the property or a history of operating or cash flow losses of the property when such impairment indicators exist we review an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment’s use and eventual disposition and compare that estimate to the carrying value of the property we consider factors such as future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand competition and other factors if our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods since cash flows on properties considered to be longlived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether the carrying value of a property is recoverable our strategy of holding properties over the longterm directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable and therefore requiring the recording of an impairment loss if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material if we determine that the asset fails the recoverability test the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value we generally estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues expenses and capital improvement costs that a market participant would use based on the highest and best use of the asset which is similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers in certain cases we may supplement this analysis by obtaining outside broker opinions of value in considering whether to classify a property as held for sale the company considers whether i management has committed to a plan to sell the property ii the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition iii the company has initiated a program to locate a buyer iv the company believes that the sale of the property is probable v the company is actively marketing the property for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current value and vi actions required for the company to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will made to the plan if all the above criteria are met the company classifies the property as held for sale  upon being classified as held for sale the company ceases all depreciation and amortization related to the property and it is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  the assets and related liabilities of the property are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets for the most recent reporting period  only those assets held for sale that constitute a strategic shift or that will have a major effect on our operations are classified as discontinued operations  to date we have had no property dispositions or assets classified as held for sale that would meet the definition of discontinued operations  table of contents index to financial statements digital realty trust inc and subsidiaries digital realty trust lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued december   and  f purchase accounting for acquisition of investments in real estate purchase accounting is applied to the assets and liabilities related to all real estate investments acquired from third parties in accordance with current accounting guidance  the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets consisting primarily of land building and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the value of abovemarket and belowmarket leases other value of inplace leases value of tenant relationships and acquired ground leases based in each case on their fair values loan premiums in the case of abovemarket rate loans or loan discounts in the case of belowmarket loans are recorded based on the fair value of any loans assumed in connection with acquiring the real estate   the fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property are determined based on comparable land sales for land and replacement costs adjusted for physical and market obsolescence for the improvements the fair values of the tangible assets of an acquired property are also determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant and the “asifvacant” value is then allocated to land building and tenant improvements based on management’s determination of the relative fair values of these assets management determines the asifvacant fair value of a property based on assumptions that a market participant would use which is similar to methods used by independent appraisers factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected leaseup periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in estimating carrying costs management includes real estate taxes insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected leaseup periods based on current market demand management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions tenant improvements legal and other related costs in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property abovemarket and belowmarket inplace lease values are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases and ii estimated fair market lease rates from the perspective of a market participant for the corresponding inplace leases measured for abovemarket leases over a period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the lease and for belowmarket leases over a period equal to the initial term plus any below market fixed rate renewal periods the leases we have acquired do not currently include any belowmarket fixed rate renewal periods the capitalized abovemarket lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining noncancelable terms of the respective leases the capitalized belowmarket lease values also referred to as acquired lease obligations are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial terms of the respective leases and any belowmarket fixed rate renewal periods in addition to the intangible value for abovemarket leases and the intangible negative value for belowmarket leases there is intangible value related to having tenants leasing space in the purchased property which is referred to as inplace lease value and tenant relationship value such value results primarily from the buyer of a leased property avoiding the costs associated with leasing the property and also avoiding rent losses and unreimbursed operating expenses during the leaseup period factors to be considered by management in its analysis of inplace lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases  in estimating carrying costs management includes real estate taxes insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected leaseup periods depending on local market conditions  in estimating costs to execute similar leases management considers leasing commissions legal and other related expenses  characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the company’s existing business relationships with the tenant growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant the tenant’s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals  the value of inplace leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases  the value of tenant relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships g goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is not amortized  management performs an annual impairment test for goodwill and between annual tests management will evaluate the recoverability of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable  in its impairment tests of goodwill management will first  table of contents index to financial statements digital realty trust inc and subsidiaries digital realty trust lp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued december   and  assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  if based on this assessment management determines that the fair value of the reporting unit is not less than its carrying value then performing the additional twostep impairment test is unnecessary if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform a twostep impairment test we test goodwill for impairment under the twostep impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized  we have not recognized any goodwill impairments since our inception goodwill amounted to approximately   million  and   million  as of  december    and   respectively   h capitalization of costs direct and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the development of properties are capitalized as incurred project costs include all costs directly associated with the development of a property including construction costs interest property taxes insurance legal fees and costs of personnel working on the project indirect costs that do not clearly relate to the projects under development are not capitalized and are charged to expense as incurred capitalization of costs begins when the activities necessary to get the development project ready for its intended use begins which include costs incurred before the beginning of construction capitalization of costs ceases when the development project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use determining when a development project commences and when it is substantially complete and ready for its intended use involves a degree of judgment we generally consider a development project to be substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy if and when development of a property is suspended pursuant to a formal change in the planned use of the property we will evaluate whether the accumulated costs exceed the estimated value of the project and write off the amount of any such excess accumulated costs for a development project that is suspended for reasons other than a formal change in the planned use of such property the accumulated project costs are evaluated for impairment consistent with our impairment policies for longlived

liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets was approximately  million and  million  respectively v assets and liabilities measured at fair value fair value under us gaap is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement therefore our fair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fairvalue measurements we use a fairvalue hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels  and  of the hierarchy and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level  of the hierarchy level  inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level  inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices such as interest rates foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity in instances where the determination of the fairvalue measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fairvalue hierarchy the lowest level input that is significant would be used to determine the fairvalue measurement in its entirety our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fairvalue measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability w transactions expense transactions expense includes acquisitionrelated expenses and other business development expenses which are expensed as incurred acquisitionrelated expenses include closing costs broker commissions and other professional fees including legal and accounting fees related to acquisitions and significant transactions

x management’s estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and

actual results could differ from those estimates made on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to the valuation of our real estate properties contingent consideration accounts receivable and deferred rent receivable performancebased equity compensation plans and the completeness of accrued liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience current market

assumptions or conditions y segment and geographic information all of our properties generate similar revenues and expenses related to tenant rent and reimbursements and operating expenses the delivery of our products is consistent across all properties and although services are provided to a wide range of customers the types of real estate services provided to them are standardized

accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers while lease contracts with customers which constitute the vast majority of our revenues are a specific scope exception this update may have implications in certain variable payment terms included in lease agreements the standard is effective for the company on january   with early adoption permitted the standard permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method and permits the use of certain practical expedients we currently anticipate using the cumulative effect transition method however this determination is subject to change as the standard does not significantly impact lessor accounting we do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our accounting for rental revenue in

disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract ie lessees and lessors the new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee this classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straightline basis over the term of the lease a lessee is also required to record a rightofuse asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than  months regardless of their classification accounting for leases with a term of  months or less will be similar to existing guidance for operating leases today the new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for salestype leases direct financing leases and operating leases asu  is expected to impact the company’s consolidated financial

b allocations of net income and net losses to partners except for special allocations to holders of profits interest units described below in note a under the heading “incentive planlongterm incentive units” the operating partnership’s net income will generally be allocated to the general partner to the extent of the accrued preferred return on its preferred units and then to the general partner and the operating partnership’s limited partners in accordance with the respective percentage interests in the common units issued by the operating partnership net loss will generally be allocated to the general partner and the operating partnership’s limited partners in accordance with the respective common percentage interests in the operating partnership until the limited partner’s capital is reduced to zero and any remaining net loss would be allocated to the general partner however in some cases losses may be disproportionately allocated to partners who have guaranteed our debt the allocations described above are subject to special allocations relating to depreciation deductions and to compliance with the provisions of sections b and c of the code and the associated treasury regulations c partnership units limited partners have the right to require the operating partnership to redeem part or all of their common units for cash based on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of the general partner’s common stock at the time of redemption alternatively the general partner may elect to acquire those common units in exchange for shares of the general partner’s common stock on a one forone basis subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits stock dividends issuance of stock rights specified extraordinary distributions and similar events pursuant to authoritative accounting guidance the operating partnership evaluated whether it controls the actions or events necessary to issue the maximum number of shares that could be

equal number of common units of the operating partnership at any time and thereafter enjoy all the rights and privileges of common units of the operating partnership including redemption rights in order to achieve full parity with common units longterm incentive units must be fully vested and the holder’s capital account balance in respect of such longterm incentive units must be equal to the capital account balance of a holder of an equivalent number of common units the capital account balance attributable to each common unit is generally expected to be the same in part because of the amount credited to a partner’s capital account upon the partner’s contribution of property to the operating partnership and in part because the partnership agreement provides in most cases that allocations of income gain loss and deduction which will adjust the partner’s capital accounts are to be made to the common units on a proportionate basis as a result with respect to a number of longterm incentive units it is possible to determine the capital account balance of an equivalent number of common units by multiplying the number of longterm incentive units by the capital account balance with respect to a common unit a partner’s initial capital account balance is equal to the amount the partner paid or contributed to the operating partnership for the partner’s units and is subject to subsequent adjustments including with respect to the partner’s share of income gain or loss of the operating partnership because a holder of longterm incentive units generally will not pay for the longterm incentive units the initial capital account balance attributable to such longterm incentive units will be zero  however the operating partnership is required to allocate income gain loss and deduction to the partner’s capital accounts in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement subject to applicable treasury regulations the partnership agreement provides that holders of longterm incentive units will receive special allocations of gain in the event of a sale or “hypothetical sale” of assets of the operating partnership prior to the allocation of gain to digital realty trust inc or other limited partners with respect to their common units the amount of any such allocation will to the extent of any such gain be equal to the difference between the capital account balance of a holder of longterm incentive units attributable to such units and the capital account balance attributable to an equivalent number of common units if and when such gain allocation is fully made a holder of longterm incentive units will have achieved full parity with holders of common units to the extent that upon an actual sale or a “hypothetical sale” of the operating partnership’s assets as described above there is not sufficient gain to allocate to a holder’s capital account with respect to longterm incentive units or if such sale or “hypothetical sale” does not occur such units will not achieve parity with common units the term “hypothetical sale” refers to circumstances that are not actual sales of the operating partnership’s assets but that require certain adjustments to the value of the operating partnership’s assets and the partners’ capital account balances specifically the partnership agreement provides that from time to time in accordance with applicable treasury regulations the operating partnership will adjust the value of its assets to equal their respective fair market values and adjust the partners’ capital accounts in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement as if the operating partnership sold its assets for an amount equal to their value such adjustments will generally be made upon the liquidation of the operating partnership the acquisition of an additional interest in the operating partnership by a new or existing partner in exchange for more than a de minimis capital contribution the distribution by the operating partnership to a partner of more than a de minimis amount of partnership property as consideration for an interest in the operating partnership the grant of an interest

applicable three year market performance period or in the case of a change in control shortened market performance period the fair values of the awards were measured using a monte carlo simulation to estimate the probability of the market vesting condition being satisfied the company’s achievement of the market vesting condition is contingent on its tsr over a three year market performance period relative to the total shareholder return of the rms the monte carlo simulation is a probabilistic technique based on the underlying theory of the blackscholes formula which was run for  trials to determine the fair value of the awards for each trial the payoff to an award is calculated at the settlement date and is then discounted to the grant date at a riskfree interest rate the total expected value of the awards on the grant date was determined by multiplying the average value per award over all trials by the number of awards granted assumptions used in the valuations are summarized as follows award date expected stock price volatility riskfree interest rate february     february     january     february     these valuations were performed in a riskneutral framework so

widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts or payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments or receipts the variable cash payments or receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves to comply with the provisions of fair value accounting guidance we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and guarantees although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level  of the fair value hierarchy the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level  inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties however as of december    we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives as a result we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level  of the fair value hierarchy we do not have any fair value measurements on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level  as of december   or december    cash flow hedges of interest rate risk our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements related to the us libor gbplibor sgdsor and cdorbased tranches of the unsecured term loan to accomplish this objective we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variablerate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for making fixedrate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount we record all our interest rate swaps on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value in determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps we consider the credit risk of our counterparties these counterparties are generally larger financial institutions engaged in providing a variety of financial services these institutions generally face similar risks regarding adverse changes in market and economic conditions including but not limited to fluctuations in interest rates exchange rates equity and commodity prices and credit spreads the recent and pervasive disruptions in the financial markets have heightened the risks to these institutions the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings during the year ended december   we recognized an increase to earnings of approximately  million related to the ineffective portion of our forwardstarting swap during the years ended december   and  there were no ineffective portions to our interest rate swaps  table of contents index to financial statements digital realty trust

accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from real estate transactions excluding a gain from a preexisting relationship impairment charges real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs noncontrolling interests in operating partnership and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures  management uses ffo as a supplemental performance measure because in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in occupancy rates rental rates and operating costs  we also believe that as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits  however because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited  other reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and accordingly our ffo may not be comparable to such other reits ffo  accordingly ffo should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance core funds from operationswe present core funds from operations or core ffo as a supplemental operating measure because in excluding certain items that do not reflect core revenue or expense streams it provides a performance measure that when compared year over year captures trends in our core business operating performance we calculate core ffo by adding to or subtracting from ffo i termination fees and other noncore revenues ii transaction and integration expenses iii loss from early extinguishment of debt iv issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock v severance equity acceleration and legal expenses vi loss on currency forwards and vii other noncore expense adjustments because certain of these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations the utility of core ffo as a measure of our performance is limited other reits may not calculate core ffo in a consistent manner accordingly our core ffo may not be comparable to other reits core ffo core ffo should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance constantcurrency core funds from operationswe calculate constantcurrency core funds from operations by adjusting the core funds from operations for foreign currency translations adjusted funds from operations affowe present adjusted funds from operations or affo as a supplemental operating measure because when compared year over year it assesses our ability to fund dividend and distribution requirements from our operating activities we also believe that as a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits affo will be used by investors as a basis to assess our ability to fund dividend payments in comparison to other reits including on a per share and unit basis we calculate affo by adding to or subtracting from core ffo i nonreal estate depreciation ii amortization of deferred financing costs iii amortization of debt discountpremium iv noncash stockbased compensation expense v straightline rent revenue vi

leasing commissions other reits may not calculate affo in a consistent manner accordingly our affo may not be comparable to other reits affo affo should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance ebitda and adjusted ebitdawe believe that earnings before interest loss from early extinguishment of debt income taxes and depreciation and amortization or ebitda and adjusted ebitda as defined below are useful supplemental performance measures because they allow investors to view our performance without the impact of noncash depreciation and amortization or the cost of debt and with respect to adjusted ebitda severancerelated expense equity acceleration and legal expenses transaction  and integration expenses gain on real estate transactions loss on currency forwards other noncore expense adjustments noncontrolling interests preferred stock dividends and issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock adjusted ebitda is ebitda excluding severancerelated expense equity acceleration and legal expenses transaction and integration expenses gain loss on real estate transactions noncash gain on lease termination loss on currency forwards other noncore expense adjustments noncontrolling interests preferred stock dividends and issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock in addition we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and income taxes exclude capitalized costs such as leasing commissions and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our business their utility as a measure of our performance is limited  other reits may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do accordingly our ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to such other reits ebitda and adjusted ebitda  accordingly ebitda and adjusted ebitda should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our financial performance net operating income noi and cash noinet operating income or noi represents rental revenue tenant reimbursement revenue and interconnection revenue less

used by stockholders company management and industry analysts as a measure of property operating performance on a cash basis however because noi and cash noi exclude depreciation and amortization and

operating performance of our properties all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations the utility of noi and cash noi as measures of our performance is limited other reits may not calculate noi and cash noi in the same manner we do and accordingly our noi and cash noi may not be comparable to such other reits noi and cash noi accordingly noi and cash
