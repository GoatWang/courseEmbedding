mines in south africa through jet engine factories and to automotive plants its not what you might expect from the head of si group a maker of specialty resins and adhesives bozich has worked in the chemical field  sometimes literally in oil fields  for nearly  years he is a former executive of several international chemical companies including the giant basf enlarge bozich with his hunting dogs inside the lobby of si groups niskayuna headquarters donna abbott vlahos  albany business review as the relatively new president and ceo of si group he signed on a year ago bozich is tasked with keeping the schenectady company ahead of the competition one recent move acquiring three businesses from an international competitor making si group one of the largest ibuprofen suppliers in the world i sat down with bozich recently to chat about entrepreneurship swimming and his vision for the company what was your first job out of college i worked in the adhesive industry for a year and a half for national starch and chemical which is now part of henkel the biggest adhesive company in the world i started as a bench chemist and after a year got a job in marketing you left that job while still in your early s i started a small adhesive company in the chicago area that focused on printing and publishing products this was back when they had telephone directories we made the adhesives that were used in book magazine and directory binding what happened my partner was a colleague at national starch we sold the company in  to a british multinational i continued on after it was sold i ran operations in the americas does that experience influence your work now by starting a company at a young age i learned quickly what i am good at what i am not good at and how to focus on strengths i also learned what it meant to make money and how to survive as a small business owner where did your interest in adhesives come from before i started with national starch i was intrigued by all of the uses for adhesives theyre used in everything from automobiles to books i got to go to breweries and see how they labeled and packaged beverages car companies aerospace plants  it was interesting to see how all of these products were made with adhesives you have a vision for what si group will look like in  when i met the shareholders in october  they explained they wanted to take si group from this profitable core business that had existed for quite some time to a growth trajectory when i joined the company i had the benefit of talking to them about developing a strategy called vision  the world really has some specific challenges that si group is adept at solving for example energy efficiency is not going to go away it is one of the critical global mega trends si group brings solutions that enable that if we have a strength at solving something the world needs that is where we want to focus what do you look for in a recruit you need to have curiosity and want to have that global work experience we are not a process and procedure company we really rely on empowered individuals everyone who works here can really change the destiny of the company we dont want people to just come here for the paycheck you start your day with a swim at the niskayuna pool i swim in lane  at  am i swam competitively and played water polo when i was young through college i won some events but wasnt worldclass i like to swim for exercise i wish i could go every day you ran basf businesses for six years your takeaways basf is the chemical company the scale and scope that they have is something i really admire about it basf is consistent they know what they are good at and they stick to that strategy i find that companies that are constantly trying to reinvent themselves tend to lose focus what are some of the patents you hold i am a coauthor on a breathable disposable diaper patent a way to package pressuresensitive adhesives using a sausage machine and a technology to recycle precious metals the first patent i was a coauthor on was the glue that holds the credit card to the mail how many patents are in your name excellent question i dont know frank bozich title

available manufacturing process corresponding to each converter description crossreference to related applications  this application claims the benefit of the filing date of us provisional application no  filed on nov  background of the invention  the present invention relates to the design of product packaging  the design of a package and selection of its components are very critical phases in the development of a new item of packaged goods for sale to industrial or consumer outlets the selection of the components for a product package is very complex the components eg substrates printing inks primers lacquers coatings and adhesives used must all meet a series of attributes based on three major factors appearance performance and protection  the package materials should be selected so that they will function efficiently in the convertors manufacturing processes such as printing coating and laminating later on the packaging line the packaging materials must function in the equipment that forms fills and seals the packages physical characteristics such as tensile and burst strength stiffness elongation softening and melting points play a vital role in these processes  the final package should appeal to the user the outward appearance of the package will strongly influence the user in terms of effectiveness and value of the contents the aesthetics of the package are a strong selling tool particularly in the consumer goods markets the appearance of the package is often the deciding factor in a buying decision in a supermarket to ensure that the package projects the desired image such factors as color texture appearance and integrity are significant  the final package should also be designed to deliver the product to the user in a pristine state so that it retains its appeal and function as long as possible the package should protect the contents from contamination from outside pollutants and should be made from components that meet all the appropriate food and drug safety laws the final package should withstand a wide variety of physical and chemical conditions to ensure the users safety and the contents purity  the selection of components capable of meeting such a wide range of attributes at an economical cost is a major task for most convertors and their customers—the consumer packaged goods manufacturers the optimization of the selected components is a long iterative process which may involve extensive multiple shelflife tests on possible structures before a suitable combination is approved this is wasteful in terms of economics time and human resources summary of the invention  the present invention is directed to a system that addresses some of the limitations and problems of the prior art in particular the present invention is directed to an integrated system that enables clients to design packages for consumer or industrial goods that meet their specific needs the system relies on a cooperative effort by the suppliers of the components used in the manufacture of packages as well as the converters who perform packagemanufacturing processes using those components these suppliers and converters will provide information on their products and services in an agreed upon standardized format so that the system will be able to reject nonconforming products the system generates one or more recommendations referred to as packaging solutions that identify those components and processes meeting the desired attributes entered by the user  the present invention will reduce the iterations involved in priorart procedures used to design a new package saving both time and money the cooperation between the suppliers and converters and their use of common standards will simplify the design process and reduce the possibilities for error the resulting optimum package design will also reduce wastage of the packaged products due to breakage spillage or shelflife limitations  in one embodiment the present invention is at a server of a package design system a computerimplemented method for generating a packaging solution for a proposed package for a client comprising the steps of a providing a component database for a plurality of different available components from a plurality of different suppliers wherein the component database identifies a set of characteristics for each available component b providing a process database for a plurality of different available manufacturing processes from one or more different converters wherein the process database identifies a set of characteristics for each available manufacturing process c receiving a set of desired attributes for the proposed package and d generating the packaging solution by comparing the set of desired attributes to the characteristics stored in the component and process databases  in another embodiment the present invention is an internetbased distributed computer system for generating a packaging solution for a

packages identified in table i  fig  shows table v which identifies different characteristics for each of the different types of substrates inks and adhesives identified in tables f g and h respectively  fig  shows table vi which identifies typical queries that would be presented by the server of fig  to a client in order to identify a set of desired attributes for a proposed package and  fig  shows a flow diagram of the processing implemented by the server of fig  to generate a packaging solution from a set of desired attributes selected by a client for a proposed packagedetailed description  fig  shows a block diagram of distributed package designing system  according to one embodiment of the present invention in addition to server  which maintains supplier component database  and converter process database  system  comprises one or more remote supplier nodes  one or more remote converter nodes  and one or more remote client nodes  each of which communicates with server  via the internet  in a preferred implementation each of server  supplier nodes  converter nodes  and client nodes  is a personal computer pc running application software specifically designed to perform appropriate operations for system  although other suitable hardware and software configurations are certainly possible  fig  shows a highlevel flow diagram of the processing implemented within system  each supplier of one or more components potentially used in the manufacture of packages uses its supplier node  to access server  via the internet in order to store andor update the component information stored in supplier component database  for the one or more components sold by that supplier step  of fig  similarly each converter who provides manufacturing services potentially involved in the manufacture of packages uses its converter node  to access server  via the internet in order to store andor update the process information stored in converter process database  for the one or more manufacturing processes performed by that converter step  each supplierconverter is responsible for ensuring that the information for its componentsprocesses is uptodate and accurate  meanwhile each client of the packagedesigning services provided by server  corresponds to a particular user of system  who wants to design a package for a particular product using one or more of the components sold by the suppliers who provide component information stored in supplier component database  andor one or more of the manufacturing processes performed by the converters who provide process information stored in converter process database  such a client uses its client node  to access server  via the internet in order to submit desired attributes for a proposed package step  this transfer of desired package attributes may be accomplished during an interactive internetbased session involving a set of queries by the server and corresponding responses by the client alternatively or in addition the transfer of desired package attributes may involve the client submitting a list of desired attributes using a standardized format for such data  in either case in response to the receipt of a set of desired package attributes for a new package server  will access the supplier component information stored in database  and the converter process information stored in database  in order to generate a packaging solution tailored to the clients specified goals which packaging solution is communicated back to the client over the internet step  in order to generate a packaging solution for a client server  classifies and rates all of the possible components andor manufacturing processes for a package against the set of desired attributes specified by the client for its proposed package  the information transmitted from the server to the client regarding the packaging solution should identify the types and amounts of components and the different manufacturing processes used in generating the new package as well as identifying the corresponding suppliers and converters depending on the implementation of server  the packaging solution may also include a stepbystep description of the manufacturing procedure for the new package including a breakdown of the costs involved at the various steps including when appropriate shipping costs between two different manufacturing facilities  in addition the packaging solution may include computergenerated images showing the package at various stages during the overall manufacturing procedure including different views of the final package both when empty and when configured eg filled with the ultimate product if such views are appropriate for example if the packaging solution involves an opaque box the differences between views of the final package empty versus filled will be minimal if any on the other hand if the packaging solution involves a transparent plastic bag the final package may look significantly different between empty versus filled  fig  shows table i which identifies typical types of packages that may be selected by server  as well as identifying typical types of materials used in such packages in particular the different types of packages include a bag or pouch a bottle a box a can a drum an overwrap and a sack  bags or pouches for example may be made from either a singleweb or a multipleweb material singleweb materials may be paper or a film which in turn may be cast or blown similarly multipleweb materials include laminates of paperfoil paperfilm filmfoil and filmfilm paperfoil laminates may be either webbonded drybonded or extrusioncoated paperfilm laminates may be wetbonded or extrusioncoated filmfoil laminates are typically drybonded and filmfilm laminates may be drybonded or extrusioncoated  bottles may be glass or plastic boxes may be plastic metal wood or carton eg either paper board or corrugated cans may be metal plastic or composite where metal cans may be either twopiece or threepiece and plastic cans may be either vacuumformed deepdrawn injectionmolded or blowmolded drums may be wood paperboard metal or plastic overwraps may be paper film or fabric sacks may be textile plastic or paper  fig  shows table ii which identifies different types of substrates typically used in the packages identified in table i fig  shows table iii which identifies different types of inks typically used in the packages identified in table i fig  shows table iv which identifies different types of adhesives typically used in the packages identified in table i  fig  shows table v which identifies different characteristics for each of the different types of substrates inks and adhesives identified in tables f g and h respectively in one embodiment of the present invention for each component in component database  the supplier of that component identifies whether the component is a substrate an ink or an adhesive the supplier also provides information for its component relating to each of the characteristics identified in table v in one implementation depending on the particular characteristic the characteristic information is provided by the supplier in the form of a relative rating eg from  to  alternatively or in addition the information for one or more of the characteristics may be provided in absolute terms eg cost in dollars per unit  similarly suppliers and converters will provide the optimum running conditions on the conversion equipment for particular components such information may include physical dimensions of the substrates needed eg width length thickness surface treatment levels running tensions maximum drying temperatures and rewind conditions for inks adhesives and coatings suppliers and converters would typically specify solvents and diluents application solids contents and viscosities coating weights application cylinder cell etch information eg number of lines per unit length cell depth cell shape and cylinder composition and running conditions eg drying temperatures air volumes air velocity laminating nip temperature and pressure and roll hardness these parameters would be entered on the printing press or laminator computer at the setup of each run adjusted by the operator during the run to optimize the results and stored at the end of the run these final settings would be recalled when the specific order is repeated  by using standardized sets of characteristics from all of the different suppliers and converters the server can assess whether individual components andor manufacturing processes satisfy the desired attributes for a particular proposed package in this way potential incompatibilities between package components and manufacturing processes will be taken into consideration in the initial phase of the design sequence thus eliminating incorrect choices this provision of component and process characteristic information corresponds to the processing of step  of fig   of course the information presented in tables c f g h and j is neither necessary nor exhaustive it is presented merely to give an example of typical types of packages their typical constituent materials and possible associated characteristics in any particular implementation items may be added andor deleted from any of the various lists in these tables moreover the set of characteristics may differ between different types of components such as between substrates inks and adhesives for example tensile strength may be a relevant characteristic of substrates but not of inks while runnability may be relevant to inks but not to substrates furthermore the characteristics of one component may depend on the selection of another component for example the peel strength of an ink may vary depending on the particular substrate to which it is applied  fig  shows table vi which identifies typical queries that would be presented by server  to a client in order to identify a set of desired attributes for the proposed package the queries in table vi correspond to one possible implementation of step  of fig  the questions and corresponding choices presented in table vi are neither necessary nor exhaustive they are presented merely to give an example of typical queries used to get the client to identify a set of desired package attributes in any particular implementation questions andor their corresponding choices may be added andor deleted from table vi  fig  shows a flow diagram of the processing implemented by server  of fig  to generate a packaging solution from a set of desired attributes selected by a client for a proposed package the processing of fig  corresponds to one possible implementation of step  of fig  in particular server  receives a set of desired package attributes from a client step  of fig  server  compares the set of desired package attributes to the information in supplier component database  and converter process database  to select the components and manufacturing processes that best meet the desired attributes selected by the client for the proposed package in particular server  selects a primary substrate step  a secondary substrate step  end use requirements step  the type of carrier for inks and adhesives step  one or more manufacturing processes to be used step  and compositional requirements for the components step  in addition server  rates performance factors for the conversion of the package components step  and for package formation step   when more than one substrate is involved the primary substrate refers to the most stable substrate to which a printing ink adhesive or coating is applied the primary substrate typically shows less deformation when passed through coating units and drying ovens a secondary substrate is a substrate that is less stable than the primary substrate and is therefore more likely to stretch under tension or shrink on passage through the drying tunnel as such a secondary substrate should be handled with more caution than the primary substrate  end use requirements refer to the requirements specified by the manufacturer of consumer packaged goods for the final package these will include physical dimensions physical characteristics such as burst strength peel strength heal seal strength and crush resistance package performance in terms of heat stability eg boilinbag hotfill pasteurization retortability abrasion resistance aggressive contents eg acid grease or essential oils puncture resistance moisture resistance gas barrier light transmission etc the end user may also specify acceptable color matching print quality bar code scannability etc  inks and adhesives are typically applied as fluids many of these resinbased systems are supplied in a carrier medium such as organic solvents or water others are supplied as low molecular weight resins that are fluid at operating temperatures of ambient to several hundred degrees  in most countries package materials that may migrate into packaged food or drugs are classified as potential food or drug additives as such they are regulated in the same way as any ingredient added directly to the food or drug in the united states the food  drug administration fda issues regulations concerning the compositional requirements of packaging materials under the reference cfr for example chapter  covers adhesives other chapters cover substrates and other coatings similar regulations have been issued by the european community other regulations may be issued by other bodies including the consumer package goods manufacturer to cover such items as heavy metal content or types of solvent many countries also issue lists on environmental and health and safety grounds of registered chemicals only chemicals appearing in these registries may be used commercially in such countries in preferred implementations of the present invention server  of fig  will be able to access data on product registrations for different countries this will prevent a package component from being selected for a country in which the product is not registered these features are referred to as compositional requirements for the components  performance factors for the conversion of the package components and for package formation refer to the running conditions for manufacturing processes described earlier in this specification  the databases used by the server to make package design decisions are critical to the success of the present invention in particular success relies on the broad ranges of attributes stored and the interrelationships between the components of a package its contents manufacture and end use the following examples show some of the factors that influence the choice of components of a package structure and their interrelationship  pouch for precooked meals  this example relates to a pouch for precooked meals of a type used in institutional catering establishments such as canteens hospitals schools or military mre meals ready to eat for example the meal may be a meat stew that is packed in  g portions in a pouch in the food processing plant subsequent to shipping the pouch and its contents are autoclaved for  minutes at ° c this ensures a sterile product with a long shelf life to withstand the processing conditions the components of the pouch must withstand the high autoclave temperatures suitable substrates include polyester or polyamide films to provide mechanical strength and puncture resistance aluminum foil to provide even heat transmission and act as a barrier to light and a polyolefine heat seal layer such as cast polypropylene to resist the oils in the food stuff and not soften and fail at the heat seal areas during autoclaving the inner surface of the aluminum foil may be primed with a vinyl wash coat to prevent attack by any essential oils in the contents the three or four layers will be laminated together by an adhesive that also has sufficient heat and chemical resistance to survive the conditions during autoclaving finally all the components in direct or indirect contact with the food contents must meet the relevant fda regulations eg  cfr  covering laminates used at temperatures above ° f substrates such as low density polyethylene and oriented polypropylene do not withstand the autoclave temperatures without softening softening would cause failure at the heat seal areas leading to package disintegration similarly an unsuitable adhesive would not withstand the processing conditions and lead to package failure as this type of pouch is usually sold to the consumer in a carton there is little need for any more than simple graphics on the pouch itself however any ink used must withstand the autoclave temperatures adhere to the polyester film and not interfere with the crosslinking of the adhesive  pouch for potato chips  in this case the pouch is the primary selling aid for the contents as such the package sitting on the sales shelf should immediately impress the retail consumer of its appeal the colors should be vibrant the package should stand up and not collapse on the shelf when the package is opened the contents should be fresh and show no signs of sogginess due to moisture penetration nor should they be rancid due to oxidation or exposure to sunlight the substrates for the package should therefore have the mechanical strength to prevent collapsing on the shelf and sufficient barrier properties to moisture sunlight and oxygen to keep the contents fresh for the desired shelf life eg  weeks furthermore there should be no tainting of the contents by traces of retained solvents in the printing inks or laminating adhesives a typical structure for such a package would be a clear outeroriented polypropylene film coronatreated on the inner surface to a minimum of  dynes per centimeter reverseprinted in flexo laminated with an aqueous drybond adhesive to a metallized oriented coextruded polypropylene film with a heat seal layer on the nonmetallized side  magazine cover laminated with an overprint film  in this case the film chosen may be cellulose acetate oriented polypropylene or polyester depending on the publishers decision on cost versus appearance the inks used to print the magazine cover should not contain phthalocyanine pigments as these will react with a urethane laminating adhesive causing discoloration the choice of solvents in the adhesive is critical for example toluene which is recommended for its performance on cellulose acetate films cannot be used on oriented polypropylene films this film performs better with ethyl acetate solvent which is not good with cellulose acetate the adhesive should be specially formulated to give high green tack to prevent delamination when the laminated sheets are separated immediately after lamination  in all the above cases possible interactions of the various components of the package are discussed in the current state of the art in package design each characteristic of a component is discussed with the supplier under embodiments of the present invention all these characteristics would be stored in the databases with appropriate ratings  in one embodiment of the present invention server  is able to save packaging solutions or even partial packaging solutions from previous package design runs in history database  of fig  in addition server  may be able to be preprogrammed with a number of partial or complete packaging solutions also stored in database  these existing packaging solutions may be identified by eg selected keywords and accessed by server  during subsequent packagedesign runs either for the same client or possibly for other clients such a learning process may even further accelerate the design process by allowing clients to use these existing packaging solutions as building blocks for their proposed packages in one embodiment of the present invention server  is able to modify an existing packaging solution based on differences in one or more of the desired attributes for the proposed package for example different raw materials or changes in costs  history database  functions as a library of partial or even complete packaging solutions for clearly defined applications these existing solutions would be based on the suppliers best experiences and would be of assistance to new entrants into package designing as the system gets used a series of existing solutions would be formulated based on input by the clients these solutions would be added to the library stored in history database  with such a library in place at the start of a package designing session a client could be offered choices of a running a complete search program based on desired attributes b searching through the library of existing solutions eg stored under corresponding key words or c revisiting solutions from that clients previous sessions  in certain implementations in addition to functioning as a package designing system system  also functions as a procurement system in particular system  enables each client to procure the components andor request the manufacturing services that it will use to manufacture the packaging solution generated by server  from the corresponding suppliers andor converters by using its client node  to transmit procurement orders to the corresponding supplier nodes  andor converter nodes  via server  and the internet in that case server  functions as a central clearing house for the procurement of components and manufacturing services by clients from suppliers and converters note that for such an implementation fig  shows bidirectional communication with each supplier node  and each converter node  in order to track procurement histories server  uses the componentprocess procurement information that passes through server  from the clients to the suppliers and converters to maintain client histories in history database  that track the procurementutilization history of each component and process by each client  the present invention may be implemented as circuitbased processes including possible implementation on a single integrated circuit as would be apparent to one skilled in the art various functions of circuit elements may also be implemented as processing steps in a software program such software may be employed in for example a digital signal processor microcontroller or generalpurpose computer  the present invention can be embodied in the form of methods and apparatuses for practicing those methods the present invention can also be embodied in the form of program code embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes cdroms hard drives or any other machinereadable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention the present invention can also be embodied in the form of program code for example whether stored in a storage medium loaded into andor executed by a machine or transmitted over some transmission medium or carrier such as over electrical wiring or cabling through fiber optics or via electromagnetic radiation wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention when implemented on a generalpurpose processor the program code segments combine with the processor to provide a unique device that operates analogously to specific logic circuits  it will be further understood that various changes in the details materials and arrangements of the parts which have been described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of this invention may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the following claims   previous patent
