failed leadership and america first theory daniel mcmahon apr    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print john burke the president of trek bicycle corp youtubetrek bicycle the president of north americas largest bicycle manufacturer has slammed president donald trump over his corporatetax reform failed leadership and misguided america first theory john burke the head of waterloo wisconsinbased trek bicycle corp lambasted trump during an interview with business insider on thursday saying he missed a huge opportunity to simplify a complicated tax system and has failed to lead the country were  days in and he finally comes out with a tax plan — and it was  words and there was no bad news burke said heres this huge opportunity to simplify everything and to have massive change and you get  words while trumps tax plan contains broad outlines rather than firm legislative text treasury secretary steven mnuchin and national economic council director gary cohn said the plan would include the biggest tax cut in us history echoing statements made by trump trek a familyowned company was cofounded by richard burke johns father in a waterloo barn in  today it is a global bike business worth over  billion and it employs  people worldwide it makes a variety of bikes including kids bikes mountain bikes and highend road bikes it also owns the treksegafredo team that competes in the tour de france burke who says he is neither a republican nor a democrat but an independent is the author of  simple solutions to save america published in  which challenges americans to resist the status quo and change what elected officials are unwilling or unable to change trek bicycle corp headquarters in waterloo wisconsin daniel mcmahonbusiness insider look i dont need a tax break — trek doesnt need a tax break burke told business insider were going to succeed and fail in the market based on how good our products are and how good our services are as a member of the community we have a moral duty to be a good corporate citizen and one way youre a good corporate citizen is you pay your taxes burke added that from a competitive standpoint american corporate taxes should come down — but so should all the deductions and while he did praise trump for reducing the number of tax brackets he criticized him for not getting rid of corporate deductions altogether you have general electric a great american company which made a profit of  billion they filed a page tax return and paid zero in taxes so if you want to reduce corporate taxes thats fine reduce them burke went on but trump wants to reduce them from  to  and i think thats too big a decline but then he doesnt want to get rid of any of the deductions why do oil companies get deductions and bicycle companies dont why do certain industries get deductions and shoemakers dont the brewer doesnt get a deduction it doesnt make sense youre leaving in place this supercomplicated tax system so its treats for everybody for corporate america you get a lower rate and you get to keep your deductions and for all the individual taxpayers you get a lower rate were  trillion frickin dollars in debt and everybody got a treat and i just go youre kidding me you call that leadership i dont on misguided america first theory burke also criticized trump on his leadership of the country when youre the president of the united states and you come out with this american first theory what are you saying to the rest of the world ive been so fortunate here in growing the business when i started here we were doing  million and now we do over a billion dollars and ive worked with an incredible team to do that we took the business from just being in the us to right now —  of our business is around the world a tour de franceworthy  trek madone race shop limited on display at trek headquarters in waterloo wisconsin cycling weekly recently named it the fastest aero road bike daniel mcmahonbusiness insider and one of the reasons why american is as strong as it is is there are a lot of great american companies who have access to markets all around the world — general electric cocacola apple trek harleydavidson the whole american first thing  i just dont find that conducive to americas future or anyone else in the world lack of leadership the best definition i ever heard of leadership is leadership is the ability to make the dream a reality at the grassroots level burke added but leadership is also heres the vision and im going to convince people where we need to go and what weve come to in american politics is saying well i need to get elected so im going to tell all these people whatever they want to hear you know if youre the richest person on the playground and youre the biggest person on the playground  you know we usually lead like talk softly and carry a big stick and when were walking around with a blow horn thats not the way we roll were a leader in the world but to maintain that status over the long haul you actually need a leader who can look at the people and say you know weve got problems here — and whether your talking about tax codes gun control nuclear proliferation big issues — here are the problems and here are the solutions and this is why we need to do it and more than just a sound bite weve got to educate people and say this is why we need to move here and i think we lack that right now and i think weve lacked it for a while president trump thomson reuters trump once sponsored the biggest bike race in america — the tour de trump — which ran for two years  before being taken over by dupont trumps proposal did not include a large number of key details including the income levels associated with a new threebracket tax system the tax rate for a onetime repatriation of corporate profits held overseas and others here are the key points of the trump plan corporate tax rate of  such a rate would deliver on trumps campaign promise the current federal statutory rate is  allows passthrough rate for business owners instead of selfowned businesses being taxed at the personal income rate business owners would have incomes from operations taxed at the  rate so if you own your own business income from that business would be taxed at the corporate rate according to the new york times that could apply to the trump organization no borderadjustment tax the tax on imports was favored by house gop leaders such as speaker paul ryan and kevin brady the chair of the ways and means committee mnuchin said the white house talked to ryan and brady but thought the tax did not work in its current form a slight adjustment to individual tax rates white house officials said there would be three tax brackets with rates of   and  down from the current seven brackets cohn told reporters that he did not have the exact incomes associated with the brackets doubling of the standard individual tax deduction this would allow individual filers to deduct their first  in income from their taxes and  for joint filers as opposed to the current  for individuals and  for joint filers a onetime repatriation tax this would allow companies to bring back money from overseas to the us with a slightly lower onetime tax the white house did not clarify the rate at which this money would be taxed president george w bush enacted a repatriation tax at a  rate in  but studies show the money brought back mostly went to stock buybacks and dividends rather than hiring workers elimination of the estate tax this would eliminate a tax on assets being transferred through a will elimination of itemized tax deductions other than charitable donations and mortgage payments mnuchin said this provision would close loopholes and offset the decrease in base tax rate for high income americans repeal a  tax on net investment income the tax was levied on individuals estates and trusts with higher than a certain threshold in investment income for instance the threshold for an individual was  in investment income last year repeal the alternative minimum tax this tax requires some people who have large numbers of deductions to calculate their income tax under the normal tax rate and the alternative and pay the higher amount according to the tax policy center the tax was originally designed to eliminate large deductions by wealthier people but now applies to about  million people no infrastructure spending reports on tuesday said trump was considering including infrastructure spending in the plan to try to win over democrats mnuchin denied the report in the speech saying the proposal would be just a tax plan read the full business insider interview with trek bicycle president john burke here you can listen to burke discussing
