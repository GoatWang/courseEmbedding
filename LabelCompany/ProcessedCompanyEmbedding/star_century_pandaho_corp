note  nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies   star century pandaho corporation the company “scpd” was organized under the laws of the state of nevada on may   the company was established as part of the chapter  reorganization of ap corporate services inc ap   pandaho the panda is a cartoon styled character on may   the company secured certain licensing rights to the pandaho character and brand though a licensing agreement with the creator of pandaho ms liu li the company’s aim is to build pandaho into a competitive cartoon brand in china and surrounding areas with pandahothemed merchandise and multimedia exhibitions currently the company does not have any operations in china   basis of presentation   the unaudited condensed financial statements of the company for the three and nine months ended march   and  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on form q and regulation sk accordingly they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for complete financial statements however such information reflects all adjustments consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments which are in the opinion of management necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations results shown for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for a full fiscal year the balance sheet information as of june   was derived from the audited financial statements included in the companys financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended june   included in the company’s annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” on september   these financial statements should be read in conjunction with that report   going concern   the accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business during the nine months ended march   the company incurred a net loss of  and used cash in operating activities of  and at march   had a stockholders’ deficiency of  these factors among others raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued the company’s independent registered public accounting firm in their report on the company’s financial statements for the year ending june   expressed substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company’s financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty should we be unable to continue as a going concern   the company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to develop additional sources of capital and to ultimately achieve profitable operations currently the company does not have significant cash or other material assets nor does it have operations or a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern over the next  months the company expects to expend up to approximately  for legal accounting and administrative costs the company’s officers or principal shareholders have committed to making advances or loans to pay for these legal accounting and administrative costs the company has not yet determined the amount of cash that will be necessary to fund its planned operations in china   the company hopes to be able to attract suitable investors for our business plan which will not require us to use our cash no assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or if available that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the company even if the company is able to obtain additional financing it may contain undue restrictions on our operations in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders in case or equity financing      estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others the accrual of potential liabilities the assumptions used in valuing sharebased instruments issued for services and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets   revenue   revenue is recognized when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service has been delivered and collectability is reasonably assured in transactions in which the company brokers a sale and determines that it was not the primary obligor in the arrangement the company records as net the commission earned from the transaction   basic and diluted loss per share   basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued diluted loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive   at march   and  we excluded the outstanding securities summarized below which entitle the holders thereof to acquire shares of common stock as their effect would have been antidilutive       march     march   common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible and nonredeemable convertible notes payable               common stock issuable upon conversion of accrued compensation               total                 sharebased compensation   the company may periodically issue shares of common stock stock options or warrants to employees and nonemployees in noncapital raising transactions for services and for financing costs the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the fasb whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to nonemployees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the fasb whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a the date at which a performance commitment is reached or b at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete nonemployee stockbased compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straightline basis in certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the nonemployee option grants are immediately vested and the total stockbased compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date   the fair value of the companys common stock option grants are estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model which uses certain assumptions related to riskfree interest rates expected volatility expected life of the common stock options and future dividends compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the blackscholes option pricing model and based on actual experience the assumptions used in the blackscholes option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods      fair value of financial instruments   fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability the fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability not on assumptions specific to the entity in addition the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of nonperformance risk including our own credit risk   in addition to defining fair value the standard expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which are determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety these levels are   level  – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets level  – inputs are based upon significant observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  such as quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level  – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the fair values are therefore determined using modelbased techniques that include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis which approximates their fair values because of the shortterm nature of these instruments the recorded values of the convertible notesrelated parties and nonredeemable convertible note approximates their fair values based upon their effective interest rates   recent accounting pronouncements   in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  revenue from contracts with customers asu  is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current us gaap and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition asu

currently in the process of evaluating the impact of asu  on the company’s financial statements and disclosures   in february  the fasb issued asu no  leases asu  requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than  months asu  is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted a modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements with certain practical expedients available the company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related disclosures      in march  the fasb issued the asu  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting the amendments in this asu require among other things that all income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled the asu also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employees shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period the company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related disclosures   other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging

develop additional sources of capital and to ultimately achieve profitable operations currently the company does not have significant cash or other material assets nor does it have operations or a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern over the next  months the company expects to expend up to approximately  for legal accounting and administrative costs the company’s officers or principal shareholders have committed to making advances or loans to pay for these legal accounting and administrative costs the company has not yet determined the amount of cash that will be necessary to fund its planned operations in china   we hope to be able to attract suitable investors for our business plan the inability to obtain financing or generate sufficient cash from operations could require us to reduce or eliminate expenditures or otherwise curtail or discontinue our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to existing stockholders if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities these securities may have rights preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs we may seek to compensate providers of services by issuing stock in lieu of cash which may also result in dilution to existing stockholders   operating capital and capital expenditure requirements   our controlling shareholders expect to advance us additional funding for operating costs in order to implement our business plan the funds are loaned to the company as required to pay amounts owed by the company as such our operating capital is currently limited to the resources of our controlling shareholders the loans from our controlling shareholders are unsecured and noninterest bearing and have no set terms of repayment we anticipate receiving additional capital once we are able to have our securities actively trading on a public exchange there is no guarantee our stock will develop a market on that public exchange   plan of operation and funding      we do not currently engage in enough business activities that provide cash flow the costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next  months and beyond such time will be paid with amounts to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors       during the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to       i filing of exchange act reports and       ii costs relating to developing our business plan we believe we will be able to meet these costs through amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors   offbalance sheet arrangements   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements critical

costs the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the fasb whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to nonemployees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of

footnote  of condensed financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable   item t controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures          as required by rule a of the securities exchange act of  our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated our companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae of the securities exchange act of  as of the end of the period covered by this report based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by our company in reports it files or submits under the securities exchange act of  is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities exchange commission and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our companys management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective was due to the presence of the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small staff i inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment and ii insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both united states generally accepted accounting principles and securities and exchange commission guidelines management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the material weaknesses are remediated    we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this quarterly report on form q we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above to remediate such weaknesses we plan to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending june   subject to obtaining additional financing i appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management and ii adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting the remediation efforts set out above are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required if we are unsuccessful in securing such funds remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in our internal

consider the risks described below before deciding to purchase shares of our common stock if any of the events contingencies circumstances or conditions described in the risks below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed   risk factors concerning our business   our business is subject to numerous risk factors including the following   the companys independent registered public accounting firm have issued a report questioning the companys ability to continue as a going concern   primarily as a result of our recurring losses and our lack of liquidity the company’s independent registered public accounting firm in their report on our financial statements for the year ending june   expressed substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern we anticipate incurring losses in the foreseeable future we do not have an established source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully compete operate profitably andor raise additional capital through other means if we are unable to reverse our losses we will have to discontinue operations   we have had little operating history and no revenues or earnings from operations   we will in all likelihood sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues at least until we begin to generate revenue from new plan of operations this may result in us incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously until we can generate revenues or raise additional capital through other means there is no assurance that we can identify such a business entity and consummate such an agreement or combination   we do not have significant cash or other material assets and we are relying on advances from stockholders officers and directors to meet our limited operating expenses we may become insolvent if we are unable to pay our debts in the ordinary course of business as they become due   our proposed plan of operation is speculative          our proposed plan of operation strategy depends in large part on our ability to build a robust platform of official and professional fan clubs for the celebrities we may not be able to enter into a substantial number of contracts that we anticipate would be necessary to support our business model     there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enhance its products or services or develop other products or services   if we are unable to achieve profitability in the future recruit sufficient personnel or raise money in the future our ability to develop our services would be adversely affected our inability to develop our services or develop new services in view of rapidly changing technology changing customer demands and competitive pressures would have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition   our principal shareholder will be able to approve all corporate actions without shareholder consent and will control our company   on january   star century entertainment inc owned  of the company’s total outstanding shares of common stock in may and june  the company issued approximately  million shares of common stock for the licensing of the pandaho intellectual property and for various services after the issuance of shares star century entertainment inc owned less than  of our common stock on september   the board of directors designated  shares of series b preferred stock par value  each share of series b preferred stock has the voting power of  common shares on september   the company issued  shares of series b preferred stock to star century entertainment inc that will have voting power of  common shares and will have significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders but not requiring the approval of the minority shareholders because it will have the majority of voting rights it will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors allowing it to exercise significant control of our affairs and management in addition it may transact most corporate matters requiring shareholder approval by written consent without a dulynoticed and dulyheld meeting of shareholders   the reporting requirements under federal securities law may delay or prevent us from making certain acquisitions   sections  and d of the securities exchange act of  as amended the  act require companies subject thereto to provide certain information about significant acquisitions including certified financial statements for the company acquired covering one two or three years depending on the relative size of the acquisition the time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare such statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by the company acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may not be appropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the  act are applicable   in addition to the audited financial statements the time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare and disclose such information may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by the company   an acquisition could create a situation wherein we would be required to register under the investment company act of  and thus be required to incur substantial additional costs and expenses   although we will be subject to regulation under the  act management believes the company will not be subject to regulation under the investment company act of  insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities in the event we engage in a business combination that results in us holding passive investment interests in a number of entities we could be subject to regulation under the investment company act of  in such event we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs we have obtained no formal determination from the securities and exchange commission as to the status of our company under the investment company act of  and consequently any violation of such act would subject us to material adverse consequences          the requirement of audited financial statements may disqualify some business opportunities seeking a business combination with us   our management believes that any potential business combination opportunity must provide audited financial statements for review for the protection of all parties to the business combination one or more attractive business opportunities may choose to forego the possibility of a business combination with us rather than incur the expenses associated with preparing audited financial statements    if our common stock does not meet blue sky resale requirements certain shareholders may be unable to resell our common stock   the resale of common stock must meet the blue sky resale requirements in the states in which the proposed purchasers reside if we are unable to qualify the common stock and there is no exemption from

our common stock due to state blue sky laws or if we are determined to be a blank check company   there are state regulations that may adversely affect the transferability of our common stock we have not registered our common stock for resale under the securities or blue sky laws of any state we may seek qualification or advise our shareholders of the availability of an exemption we are under no obligation to register or qualify our common stock in any state or to advise the shareholders of any exemptions   current shareholders and persons who desire to purchase the common stock in any trading market that may develop in the future should be aware that there might be significant state restrictions upon the ability of new investors to purchase the common stock  blue sky laws regulations orders or interpretations place limitations on offerings or sales of securities by blank check companies or in blindpool offerings or if such securities represent cheap stock previously issued to promoters or others our former ceo because he received stock at a price of  for each share may be deemed to hold cheap stock these limitations typically provide in the form of one or more of

on such offerings have been adopted in   alaska                          nevada   tennessee arkansas new mexico            texas california ohio utah delaware          oklahoma   vermont

such rules the broker or dealer must make a special written determination that a penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction

accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities when making these estimates and assumptions we consider our historical experience our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ under different estimates and assumptions   the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties   revenue   revenue is recognized when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an

vesting to nonemployees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the fasb whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a the date at which a performance commitment is reached or b at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete nonemployee stockbased compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straightline basis in certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the nonemployee option grants are immediately vested and the total stockbased compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date   the fair value of the companys common stock option grants are estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model which uses certain assumptions related to riskfree interest rates expected volatility expected life of the common stock options and future dividends compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the blackscholes option pricing model and based on actual experience the assumptions used in the blackscholes option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense

material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small staff i inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment and ii insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both us gaap and sec guidelines   we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this annual report on form k we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above to remediate such weaknesses we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending june   i appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management and ii adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting the remediation efforts set out in i and ii are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required if we are unsuccessful in securing such funds remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner   changes in internal control over financial reporting there was no change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the requisite evaluation that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting          item

continue as a going concern the company’s independent registered public accounting firm in its report on our june   financial statements has raised substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company’s financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   the company has experienced recurring operating losses and used cash in operating activities since inception we expect to be able to secure capital through advances from our officers or principal shareholders in order to pay expenses such as filing fees accounting fees and legal fees over the next  months the company expects to expend approximately  for such filing fees accounting fees and legal fees the company has not yet determined the amount of cash that will be necessary to fund its planned operations in china we hope to be able to attract suitable investors for our business plan the inability to obtain financing or generate sufficient cash from operations could require us to reduce or eliminate expenditures or otherwise curtail or discontinue our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to existing stockholders if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities these securities may have rights preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs we may seek to compensate providers of services by issuing stock in lieu of cash which may also result in dilution to existing stockholders       f      note  summary of significant accounting policies   estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others the accrual of potential liabilities and the assumptions used in valuing sharebased instruments issued for services   cash and cash equivalents   investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents   income taxes   the company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis temporary differences the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income loss in the period that includes the enactment date   revenue   revenue is recognized when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service has been delivered and collectability is reasonably assured in transactions in which the company brokers a sale and determines that it was not the primary obligor in the arrangement the company records as net the commission earned from the transaction   basic and diluted loss per share   basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued diluted loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive   at june   and  we excluded the outstanding securities summarized below which entitle the holders thereof to acquire shares of common stock as their effect would have been antidilutive       june     june   common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible and nonredeemable convertible notes payable               common stock issuable upon conversion of accrued compensation            —     total                 stockbased compensation   the company may periodically issue shares of common stock stock options or warrants to employees and nonemployees in noncapital raising transactions for services and for financing costs the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the fasb whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on the straightline basis over the vesting period the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to nonemployees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the fasb whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a the date at which a performance commitment is reached or b at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete options granted to nonemployees are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period as the options vest they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting nonemployee stockbased compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straightline basis in certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the nonemployee option grants are immediately vested and the total stockbased compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date   f        the fair value of the companys common stock option grants are estimated using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which uses certain assumptions related to riskfree interest rates expected volatility expected life of the common stock options and future dividends compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the blackscholesmerton option pricing model and based on actual experience the assumptions used in the blackscholesmerton option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods   fair value of financial instruments   fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability the fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability not on assumptions specific to the entity in addition the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of nonperformance risk including our own credit risk   authoritative guidance provided by the fasb defines the following levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these financial assets   level  – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets level  – inputs are based upon significant observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  such as quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level  – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the fair values are therefore determined using modelbased techniques that include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis which approximates their fair values because of the shortterm nature of these instruments the recorded values of the convertible notesrelated parties and nonredeemable convertible note approximates their fair values based upon their effective interest rates   concentration of credit risk   financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents the company places its cash with high quality financial institutions and at times may exceed the fdic  insurance limit the company does not anticipate incurring any losses related to these credit risks the company extends credit based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition generally without collateral exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customers financial condition the company monitors its exposure for credit losses and intends to maintain allowances for anticipated losses as required   during the year ended june    of our revenue was from one customer     f      recent accounting pronouncements   in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  revenue from contracts with customers asu  is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current us gaap and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition asu  will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract the asu also will require additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract asu  is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods therein entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of asu  on the company’s financial statements and disclosures   in february  the fasb issued asu no  leases asu  requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than  months asu  is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted a modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements with certain practical expedients available the company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related disclosures   in march  the fasb issued the asu
