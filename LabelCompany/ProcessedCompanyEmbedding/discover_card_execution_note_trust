sf to discovers a card abs global credit research   apr   million of securities rated new york april    moodys investors service has assigned a definitive aaa sf rating to the discoverseries class a notes issued by the discover card execution note trust the trust sponsored by discover bank discover moodys also announced today that the issuance of the discover card execution note trust discoverseries class a notes on  april  would not in and of itself and as of this time result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to any class of outstanding securities issued by the trust moodys rating action is as follows issuer discover card execution note trust discoverseries notes  discoverseries class a notes definitive rating assigned aaa sf rating rationale the rating is based on the quality of the underlying credit card receivables the expertise of discover as servicer the transactions legal and structural protections including early amortization trigger events the credit enhancement provided by subordinate notes and the likelihood of the sponsor becoming insolvent and shutting down its credit card portfolio moodys assesses this likelihood from the sponsors counterparty risk assessment cr assessment the discoverseries class a notes will have a fixed rate coupon of  per year an expected maturity date of  april  and a legal maturity date of  october  moodys rating addresses the likelihood of interest payments being made when due and the return of principal by the legal maturity date the assets of the trust consist of the series cc collateral certificate issued by the discover card master trust i the master trust which represents an undivided interest in the master trusts credit card receivables originated and serviced by discover discovers longterm deposit rating is a stablelongterm senior unsecured baa stable longterm cr assessment baacr shortterm deposits p and bca baa summary of analytical outputs moodys aaa lgsd and aaa ce are  and  respectively for this transaction the aaa lgsd reflects moodys expectation of the trusts performance following a sponsor default and portfolio shutdown the aaa ce reflects the level of credit enhancement consistent with a aaa sf rating by haircutting the aaa lgsd based on the rating of the sponsor moodys expects performance in the range of    for chargeoffs    for yield and    for the principal payment rate moodys performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term from time to time moodys may if warranted change these expectations performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had anticipated when the related securities were rated even so a deviation from the expected range will not necessarily result in a rating action nor does performance within expectations preclude such actions the decision to take or not take a rating action is dependent on an assessment of a range of factors including but not exclusively the performance metrics methodology underlying the rating action the principal methodology used in this rating was moodys approach to rating credit card receivablesbacked securities published in june  please see the rating methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology on  march  moodys released a request for comment in which it has requested market feedback on potential revisions to its approach to rating credit card receivablesbacked securities also on  march  moodys released another request for comment in which it has requested market feedback on potential revisions to its approach to assessing counterparty risks in structured finance if the revised methodologies are both implemented as proposed the credit rating on the class a notes is not expected to be affected please refer to moodys requests for comment titled moodys proposes limited changes to its approach to rating credit card receivablesbacked securities and moodys proposes revisions to its approach to assessing counterparty risks in structured finance for further details regarding the implications of the proposed methodology revisions on certain credit ratings factors that would lead to a downgrade of the rating moodys could downgrade the rating of the class a notes if our expectation of the trusts performance following a sponsor default and portfolio shutdown ie aaa lgsd deteriorates materially specifically if the chargeoff rate rises or the payment rate or yield falls an increase in moodys assessment of the likelihood of the sponsor shutting down its credit card portfolio generally reflected from a downgrade in the sponsors cr assessment could also lead to a downgrade to the rating of the class a notes loss and cash flow analysis in rating this transaction moodys uses a cash flow model to determine the collateral losses in a maximum stress scenario as a second step moodys haircuts such collateral losses based on the sponsors credit quality finally moodys compares note available credit enhancement with the adjusted collateral losses taking into account loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument stress scenarios moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows ratings of existing notes unaffected moodys also announced today that the issuance of the discover card execution note trust class a notes on  april  would not in and of itself and as of this time result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to any class of outstanding securities issued by the trust the issuance of the class a notes will increase the investors share of the collateral pool of credit card receivables by the proportional amount of the new issuance and will correspondingly decrease the sellers share of the pool by the same proportion both the class a notes and the outstanding securities share a pro rata undivided interest in the same collateral pool of credit card receivables and have similar terms moodys has therefore determined that the issuance in and of itself and at this time will not result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings currently assigned to any class of outstanding securities issued by the trust regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and

service has assigned a definitive aaa sf rating to the discoverseries class a notes issued by the discover card execution note trust the trust sponsored by discover bank discover moodys also announced today that the issuance of the discover card execution note trust discoverseries class a notes on  april  would not in and of itself and as of this time result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to any class of outstanding securities issued by the trust moodys rating action is as follows issuer discover card execution note trust discoverseries notes  discoverseries class a notes definitive rating assigned aaa sf rating rationale the rating is based on the quality of the underlying credit card receivables the expertise of discover as servicer the transactions legal and structural protections including early amortization trigger events the credit enhancement provided by subordinate notes and the likelihood of the sponsor becoming insolvent and shutting down its credit card portfolio moodys assesses this likelihood from the sponsors counterparty risk assessment cr assessment the discoverseries class a notes will have a floating rate coupon of onemonth libor plus  an expected maturity date of  april  and a legal maturity date of  october  moodys rating addresses the likelihood of interest payments being made when due and the return of principal by the legal maturity date the assets of the trust consist of the series cc collateral certificate issued by the discover card master trust i the master trust which represents an undivided interest in the master trusts credit card receivables originated and serviced by discover discovers longterm deposit rating is a stablelongterm senior unsecured baa stable longterm cr assessment baacr shortterm deposits p and bca baa summary of analytical outputs moodys aaa lgsd and aaa ce are  and  respectively for this transaction the aaa lgsd reflects moodys expectation of the trusts performance following a sponsor default and portfolio shutdown the aaa ce reflects the level of credit enhancement consistent with a aaa sf rating by haircutting the aaa lgsd based on the rating of the sponsor moodys expects performance in the range of    for chargeoffs    for yield and    for the principal payment rate moodys performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term from time to time moodys may if warranted change these expectations performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had anticipated when the related securities were rated even so a deviation from the expected range will not necessarily result in a rating action nor does performance within expectations preclude such actions the decision to take or not take a rating action is dependent on an assessment of a range of factors including but not exclusively the performance metrics methodology underlying the rating action the principal methodology used in this rating was moodys approach to rating credit card receivablesbacked securities published in june  please see the rating methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology on  march  moodys released a request for comment in which it has requested market feedback on potential revisions to its approach to rating credit card receivablesbacked securities also on  march  moodys released another request for comment in which it has requested market feedback on potential revisions to its approach to assessing counterparty risks in structured finance if the revised methodologies are both implemented as proposed the credit rating on the class a notes is not expected to be affected please refer to moodys requests for comment titled moodys proposes limited changes to its approach to rating credit card receivablesbacked securities and moodys proposes revisions to its approach to assessing counterparty risks in structured finance for further details regarding the implications of the proposed methodology revisions on certain credit ratings factors that would lead to a downgrade of the rating moodys could downgrade the rating of the class a notes if our expectation of the trusts performance following a sponsor default and portfolio shutdown ie aaa lgsd deteriorates materially specifically if the chargeoff rate rises or the payment rate or yield falls an increase in moodys assessment of the likelihood of the sponsor shutting down its credit card portfolio generally reflected from a downgrade in the sponsors cr assessment could also lead to a downgrade to the rating of the class a notes loss and cash flow analysis in rating this transaction moodys uses a cash flow model to determine the collateral losses in a maximum stress scenario as a second step moodys haircuts such collateral losses based on the sponsors credit quality finally moodys compares note available credit enhancement with the adjusted collateral losses taking into account loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument stress scenarios moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows ratings of existing notes unaffected moodys also announced today that the issuance of the discover card execution note trust discoverseries class a notes on  april  would not in and of itself and as of this time result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to any class of outstanding securities issued by the trust the issuance of the class a notes will increase the investors share of the collateral pool of credit card receivables by the proportional amount of the new issuance and will correspondingly decrease the sellers share of the
