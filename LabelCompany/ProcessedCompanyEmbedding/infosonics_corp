am re none post  of   all we need is the new product launch to still be on schedule andor a small net profit for the next reportable quarter and one dollar is no problem we could also get there on air or with current momentum there have been a few crazy moves from small caps the last few weeks and this one has an unusual number of followers at a few places there is a chance that if we can get back to  or  cents in the next few days that there could be a blow off top even higher than that as a final push is made and that is if there isnt even news the float is low enough that if enough people jump on there will be options for those who bought low i still say that worst case scenario we get to one dollar or more for ten days before ever having to do a reverse split they were basically given another  days because the original deadline was may st it appears that i was correct on how low this could go i dont believe there is any surprise out there that could create a huge selloff to under  cents so i am expecting between one and two dollars by the end of the summer as management now knows what it needs to do and they can time their launch accordingly in good shape here total games being played with the price remember to always buy when there is pain on the message boards though sometimes you can take a shot after it starts percolating you had a chance to buy yesterday for a whole  minutes at  and below so there is nobody to blame but yourself i still think that anything under  cents makes  percent on their money by the end of summer so it is not too late there is a real chance for a manic episode to the upside where money appears to grow in your account at a ridiculous rate so keep your cool and wait for it to happen far worse companies have had huge runs recently and ifon is more legit than most still selling for under net cash and the momentum can be on our side for quite a while float is tight with the only pullbacks being from flippers who chase the highs we should see multiple legs up over the next few weeks and likely stabilize at close to one dollar as opposed to the  cents level while delisting uncertainty was there ihub newswire drill targets at red cloud
