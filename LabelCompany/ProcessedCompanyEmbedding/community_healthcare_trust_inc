healthcare providers that offer high quality healthcare services in sustainable nonurban markets we are investing in properties that are integral to providing need based healthcare services to a stable or growing population base   we believe healthcare providers will need to invest a significant amount of capital in nonurban areas over the next several decades in order to   provide lower cost healthcare in the patients’ local communities than they can by transporting the nonurban population to high cost urban centers and   ramp up their services as there are natural population increases in the non urban areas and as the affordable care act brings more of the nonurban population base into some type of insurance coverage   our goal is to develop relationships with these healthcare providers and invest with them in their local communities   tenants of our properties include many nationally recognized healthcare providers or their affiliates such as adventist hca fresenius and

example government and government agency certificates government bonds certificates of deposit interestbearing bank deposits money market accounts and mortgage loan participations we compete for property acquisitions with other investors healthcare providers other healthcare related reits real estate partnerships and financial institutions the operation of all of our properties including the initial properties will be subject to competition from similar properties certain tenants of other properties may have greater capital resources than we do in addition the extent to which the initial properties are utilized depends upon several factors including the number of physicians using or referring patients to the healthcare facilities leasing the initial properties competitive systems of healthcare delivery and the area population size and composition private federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant effect on the utilization of the properties virtually all of the initial properties operate in a competitive environment and patients and referral sources including physicians may change their preferences for a healthcare facility from time to time company description we are a fullyintegrated healthcare real estate company that was recently organized as a maryland corporation to acquire and own properties that are leased to hospitals doctors healthcare systems or other healthcare service providers in nonurban markets our strategic focus is to invest in real estate that is diversified across healthcare provider geography facility type and industry segment we believe that favorable demographic trends continuing increases in healthcare spending and the continuing shift in the delivery of healthcare services to communitybased outpatient facilities create attractive opportunities for us we intend to focus on nonurban healthcare facilities because we believe these properties are essential to healthcare providers in their local markets and can generate more attractive riskadjusted returns than similar facilities in urban markets in addition we believe our management teams extensive relationships with healthcare providers and owners of healthcare facilities will provide us with the opportunity to acquire attractive nonurban healthcare facilities outside of a competitive bidding process furthermore we believe there is significantly less competition from existing reits and institutional buyers for these nonurban assets upon completion of this offering and the acquisition of our initial properties we will own  properties comprised of an aggregate of approximately  leasable square feet located in  states our initial properties are leased by healthcare providers across a diverse range of both facility types and healthcare industry segments including ambulatory surgery centers behavioral facilities dialysis clinics medical office buildings oncology centers and physician clinics as of march   the initial properties were approximately  leased to  separate tenants we believe our staggered lease maturity schedule and active asset management will optimize the value of our portfolio by consistently achieving market rental rates in new leases when the existing leases expire substantially all of our revenues will be derived from net leases pursuant to which our tenants are generally responsible for substantially all of the operating expenses relating to the property including real estate taxes utilities property insurance routine maintenance and repairs and property management we believe this net lease structure helps insulate us from increases in certain operating expenses and provides more predictable cash flow the leases for our initial properties typically include rent escalation provisions designed to provide us with annual growth in our rental revenues tenants of our initial properties include many nationally recognized healthcare providers or their affiliates such as adventist healthcare inc or adventist hospital corporation of america or hca fresenius medical care ag  co kgaa or fresenius and amsurg corp or amsurg through these property investments and corresponding operating income we seek to generate attractive riskadjusted returns for our stockholders through a combination of stable and increasing dividends and potential
