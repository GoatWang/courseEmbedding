first administrative law code opening development of government regulation in all of alabamas state boards agencies departments and commissions for public notice and input his public sector work also included service on the executive staff of the mayor of alabamas largest city where ron established birminghams first environmental court realizing the undeniable role public education plays to advance social and economic justice juxtaposed to birminghams virulent poverty doubledigit grade retention high dropout rates and a fiscally unsound school district failing to link spending with academic achievement ron along with founding members of citizens for better schools resolved to work structuring schools for success — making the vision work for all students regardless of where they may live or attend school rons work and passion has been opening doors of opportunity for innercity poor students in public schools recognizing that gifted and talented students have the potential to excel academically but are often underachievers who fall through the cracks with most of these students being undiscovered and underserved by their schools and districts citizens for better schools changed that in birmingham where the 3student school district was  percent black but enrolled only  percent of its black students in gifted and talented programs compared to  percent of the systems white students in a school system whose school board was predominantly black with a black superintendent in the face of fierce criticism from the african american community ron effectively used title vi of the 6 civil rights act to open birminghams gifted and talented program to young gifted and black students when school districts across alabama refused to allow transfers for title i students whose schools failed to make adequate yearly progress ayp under the no child left behind act citizens for better schools won a rare and first ever enforcement order from the united states department of education establishing the principle that lack of capacity is no justification to leave a poor child in a failing school when districts can reconstitute faculties or innovate for success structuring schools for success — making the vision work for all students when small academically successful neighborhood elementary schools in birmingham were faced with closing due to being too costly to operate ron organized high school students studying economics to present before the alabama state department of education sophisticated statistical regression analysis demonstrating birminghams small schools controlled cost more efficiently and produced better academic results than newer large schools beyond public sector work rons civic duties have ranged from serving on the board of directors of the jefferson county mental health association and the historic th avenue branch ymca a supporting member of the birmingham museum of art the miles college and university of
