and arbitrage opportunities  ironsides employs arbitrage distressed opportunities and special situation strategies with a focus on closedend funds holding companies and corporate restructuringsour

readily ascertainable asset values or to sell or short securities priced at a premium to intrinsic value other strategies employ more traditional value investing methodsin most cases we seek to hedge market risk with the objective of eliminating beta and in other instances we employ more traditional unhedged value investing methods in all cases our ultimate objective is to earn absolute returns while minimizing downside risk and benefitting from a margin of safetyironsides manages three ironsides funds and one unaffiliated managed account robert knapp the managing director of ironsides is a
