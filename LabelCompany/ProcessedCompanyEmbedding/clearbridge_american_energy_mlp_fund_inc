changes in tax laws mlp cash distributions are generally tax deferred noncash expenses such as depreciation or depletion usually offset income derived from an mlps operations to the extent that these expenses exceed income cash distributions are considered return of capital under tax law as such they are not taxed when received instead the distribution in the form of return of capital reduces a unit holders cost basis this adjusted cost basis in turn results in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when the units are sold of course there can be no assurances that distributions from an mlp will be tax deferred the fund will be treated as a regular corporation for us federal income tax purposes and as a result unlike most investment companies is subject to corporate income tax to the extent the fund recognizes taxable income any taxes paid by the fund will reduce the amount available to pay distributions to investors and therefore investors in the fund will likely receive lower distributions than if they invested directly in mlps distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change leverage may result in greater volatility of nav and market price of the funds common
