development and operation of most mines for the ochoa project ic potash corp is developing a deep nonpotable water supply from the capitan aquifer supplying the ochoa project with water from the capitan aquifer is advantageous for many reasons no permit is required because the aquifer meets the basic criteria for mining established by the state of new mexico both bureau of land management and new mexico office of the state engineer are supportive of using deep brackish groundwater for mining there is a track record in the region for the use of deep brackish groundwater from the capitan aquifer there would be no competition for the limited freshwater resources that are essential to the surrounding communities the capitan aquifer is composed of the capitan formation parts of the goat sheep formation and the artesia group all referred to as the capitan reef complex the capitan reef complex is a horseshoeshaped limestone deposit surrounding the delaware basin and is present in southeastern new mexico and western texas the complex extends over a distance of approximately  miles within lea county the aquifer ranges from  to  feet thick and is approximately  miles wide near the eddy county and lea county boundary and  miles wide near jal new mexico history of water use brackish groundwater from the capitan aquifer has been used historically for secondary oil recovery thus establishing a precedent for using this resource for industrial purposes historical sources discuss a number of brackish groundwater development projects in the capitan reef including the jal water supply system near jal new mexico and el capitan source water system near kermit texas the el capitan source water system was developed in the mids by shell oil for secondary oil recovery these wells were completed in the capitan reef with plans to pump up to  acrefeet per year the new mexico office of the state engineer documented water use from this well field in the range of  acrefeet per year in  expected to be in the range of  acrefeet per year in  in  the estimated total fluid withdrawals from the capitan reef in texas were in the range of  to  acrefeet per year from  to  thus there is clear evidence of significant historical usage of brackish water from the capitan aquifer indicating a high probability of success for its use as a supply source for ochoa the el capitan system was

already overburdened agricultural industry to meet this demand farmers increasingly need to apply more fertilizers to keep pace this equates to reduced inventories and stronger prices for fertilizers in the near and long term fertilizers are compounds of nutrients given to plants with the intention of promoting growth the three primary macronutrients are nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k secondary macronutrients include calcium ca magnesium mg and sulfur s there are also micronutrients which benefit plant growth including boron b copper cu iron fe chloride cl manganese ma molybdenum mo and zinc zn these nutrients or fertilizers are applied through the soil for uptake by plant roots or by foliar spraying for uptake through leaves fertilizers can be organic composed of organic matter ie carbonbased or inorganic containing simple inorganic chemicals fertilizer compounds can be naturallyoccurring such as peat or mineral deposits or manufactured through natural eg composting or chemical eg haberbosch or mannheim processes production entails gathering raw materials from nature treating them to purify or increase their concentration converting them into plantavailable forms and often combining them into products that contain more than one nutrient the global demand for fertilizers has been rebounding since the economic downturn of  and is forecast to reach  million tons
