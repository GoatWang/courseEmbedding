product development  lixte biotechnology holdings inc lixte lixte drug pipeline background living cells depend on a critical balance between positive and negative regulation of signaling systems these systems allow cells to adapt to environmental changes whether introduced from the environment by diet exposure to drugs or radiation or defects in metabolism including diabetes and inborn enzyme deficiencies such as gaucher von hippellindau and neurofibromatosis type  disease the normal functioning of healthy cells is a marvel of multiple continual small adjustments in systems regulating growth and metabolism these balancing mechanisms are mediated through a series of offon switches which keep cells from responding too much or too little to the constantly changing environment lixte designs compounds to attack key signaling pathways altered in cancer and other serious diseases important switch mechanisms altered in many serious diseases are the rapid and reversible modification of signaling enzymes through the addition or removal of small chemical groups phosphate and acetyl moieties lixtes proprietary compounds target specific components of these switch mechanisms the lb series inhibit removal of phosphate groups phosphatase inhibitors and the lb series inhibit removal of acetyl groups deacetylase inhibitors because the selected targets are multifunctional enzymes this approach has resulted in the discovery of novel agents with potential value in the treatment of seemingly disparate diseases in animal models of cancer and cellular models of inborn metabolic diseases modulation of regulatory pathways by lixte compounds has demonstrated potential therapeutic benefit lixte has awarded and pending patents for the compounds and the potential uses shown in the pipeline chart phosphatase inhibitors cancer regulation of cell division in cancers is abnormal because of acquired as opposed to inborn gene abnormalities mutations this faulty regulation often provides the cancer cell a growth advantage over the normal cell allowing the cancer to spread locally andor distantly metastasis this growth advantage comes at a cost to the cancer cell however because it is accompanied by a loss of function of backup systems needed for survival under stress including exposure to anticancer drugs or radiation on the other hand normal cells possess a full complement of regulatory systems and are often not as vulnerable to growth inhibition or killing even though an important regulatory pathway is transiently altered by a drug lixte exploits this differential sensitivity to cell killing between the cancer cell and normal cell to enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatment lixte has targeted an enzyme protein phosphatase a ppa which removes phosphate groups from proteins involved in control of cell growth and repair of dna damage caused by chemotherapy andor radiation when ppa is inhibited during chemotherapy or radiation treatment the ppamediated defense mechanisms which ordinarily are activated to protect cells from fatal dna damage fail to function enhancing the cancer killing effects of the treatment without enhancing toxicity to normal cells which can compensate for ppa inhibition because of the universality of this mechanism toxicity permitting the lead compound lb has the potential for improving the effectiveness of current and evolving chemo and radiotherapy regimens for many if not all cancers despite the importance of ppa to the survival of cancer cells during aggressive chemotherapyradiotherapy regimens an important cause of drug resistance no inhibitors of ppa are currently approved for clinical use targeting ppa has not been clinically exploited presumably because of concern that inhibition of a protein with multiple functions would be associated with unreasonable toxicity lixtes large animal studies however suggest that the first of its ppa inhibitors lb can be given intermittently at significant enzymeinhibiting doses with no observable toxicity and daily for  days without encountering limiting toxicity two decades ago a naturally occurring inhibitor of ppa the antibiotic fostriecin was evaluated in phase i studies sponsored by the national cancer institute because of its broad spectrum of anticancer activity in model systems fostriecin was given intravenously daily for  days without encountering doselimiting toxicity however the trials were discontinued before the maximum tolerable dose could be determined because of inadequate drug supply of this natural product the reported toxicity profile of fostriecin in large animal studies and in those patients showing toxicity in the aborted clinical trials is similar to that found in animal studies of lixtes lead ppa inhibitor lb lb has been approved by the food and drug administration for phase i study in patients with advanced cancers given alone and then in combination with a widely used anticancer drug docetaxel in animal studies lb shows dosedependent enhancement of docetaxel activity against human breast cancer xenografts once the toxicity of lb in combination with docetaxel is determined in the phase i study lixte plans to pursue phase ii trials of the drug combination against malignancies for which docetaxel alone is an approved treatment these include cancers of the lung stomach head and neck ovary and prostate in addition because preclinical studies indicate that lb markedly enhances the anticancer effects of radiation on solid tumors in animal models resources permitting lixte will pursue additional phase i studies of lb in combination with radiation there is a longstanding need for radiosensitizing drugs for treatment of cancers where an increase in the effectiveness of xray may increase the possibility of cure for localized lesions andor permit dose reduction of radiation thereby decreasing toxicity and duration of treatment without sacrificing efficacy vascular disease ppa mediates a number of different signaling pathways and is of fundamental importance to several otherwise seemingly unrelated disease entities for example ppa is an essential component of the response of normal cells to deprivation of oxygen ischemia during ischemia there are abnormal increases in the amounts of ppa in tissues particularly in blood vessels which appear to contribute to the extent of tissue damage in animal models inhibition of ppa even instituted after the induction of acute ischemia reduces the extent of infarction with additional funding lixte will seek to document the ability of lb to decrease tissue damage in models of stroke myocardial infarction and septic shock as has been reported for fostriecin and other inhibitors of ppa lixte deacetylase inhibitors deacetylase inhibitors daci are compounds which prevent the removal of a chemical group acetyl group modifier from many proteins daci have been studied primarily as modifiers of gene expression when a class of proteins the histones is acetylated carry an acetyl group the genetic material dna is more accessible active than when the acetyl groups are removed by deacetylases because disordered gene regulation is one hallmark of cancer cells histone deacetylase inhibitors hdaci have been studied intensely as anticancer drugs and several have been approved for treatment of a relatively rare lymphoma of the skin lixte has developed a novel group of daci which appear to be more stable and potentially possess broader actions than other hdaci and seeks to develop these compounds for potential treatment of specific nonmalignant diseases as described below inborn metabolic diseases two lixte daci lb and lb inhibit the accelerated breakdown of misfolded” proteins responsible for enzyme deficiencies in several hereditary diseases including gaucher disease neurofibromatosis  and von hippellindau disease exposure of cells with mutant proteins responsible for these diseases leads to stabilization of the proteins and potentially clinically significant increases in enzyme function it appears that daci inhibit the machinery responsible for the rapid destruction of these functional but mutant enzymes given the relatively low toxicity of hdaci in general and of lixtes compounds in particular the lb series of drugs have potential for the therapy of several inherited diseases for which better treatments are sorely needed in particular if lb or lb stabilizes the mutant protein causing gaucher disease glucocerebrosidase in vivo as it does in vitro the compounds may reduce the amount of enzyme replacement therapy required for treatment of nonneurologic gaucher disease currently costing in excess of  annually because lb penetrates the blood brain barrier it may be particularly beneficial in the treatment of neurologic forms of gaucher disease in which enzyme replacement is currently ineffective neurodegenerative diseases lixtes dacis have also been studied for the prevention and treatment of a variety of chronic and acute neurologic diseases because of the relatively low toxicity of hdacis in general lixtes lb was evaluated for its ability to reduce toxicity of various biochemical stresses in models of brain cell neuron injury lb was significantly protective against acute injury in these cell culture models and a homolog lb reduced the extent of brain injury in rodent models of traumatic brain injury tbi lixte hopes to engage a governmental or academic research group to assess the potential of its deacetylase inhibitors of brain injury particularly for treatment of tbi fungal infections because acetylationdeacetylation signaling pathways are essential components of the regulated growth of many types of organisms lixtes compounds were assessed for antifungal activity several compounds of the lb series are active against a panel of clinical isolates of fungal pathogens a topical formulation of lb is curative for two of the most common dermal fungal infections of humans and animals in a guinea pig model which is generally accepted as a reliable surrogate for human skin infections as there appears to be no toxicity associated with the topical use of lb lixte seeks a partner to proceed promptly to clinical development for this use compounds in discovery lixte is developing two additional novel classes of compounds the lb and lb series molecules in these classes are designed to inhibit signaling pathways which lixte believes will result in anticancer activity in the lb series the targets are components of an enzyme complex important to cell division in the lb series the target is an enzyme shown to be important in cell replication and in the pathogenesis of several types of cancers and certain nonmalignant diseases prototypes of each series have anticancer activity against different types of human cancers in vitro and are presently being evaluated in animal models back to the top investor

identify enzyme targets associated with serious common diseases and then designs compounds to attack those targets the companys primary focus is developing new treatments for human cancers the scope of applications of the companys products has expanded to other common nonmalignant diseases including vascular diseases heart attacks and stroke diabetes genetic diseases such as gauchers disease and depression and potentially posttraumatic stress syndrome the company designs drugs for which there are existing data suggesting that they may affect the altered pathways of the cancer cell and may be given safely to humans this approach has led to the development of over two classes of drugs for the treatment of cancer consisting of protein phosphatase inhibitors ptasei designated by the company as the lb series of compounds and histone deacetylase inhibitors hdaci designated by the company as the lb series of compounds compounds of both types also have use in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseasesthe lb series consists of structures which may be useful in the treatment of not only several types of cancer but also vascular and metabolic diseases the lb series contains compounds which may be useful for the treatment of chronic hereditary diseases such as gauchers disease in addition to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases the second class of drugs under development by the company the lb series is the histone deacetylase inhibitors the company has demonstrated that its hdaci has broad activity against various cancer types neuroprotective activity and antifungal activity in addition these compounds have low toxicity making them attractive candidates for development the neuroprotective activity of the companys hdaci has been demonstrated in the test tube in model systems that mimic injury to brain cells such as occurs in stroke and alzheimers disease this type of protective activity may have application to a broad spectrum of other chronic neurodegenerative diseases including parkinsons disease and amytrophic lateral sclerosis als or lou gehrigs disease » full overview of lixtpk company address lixte biotechnology holdings inc  route a

page  lixte biotechnology holdings inc lixte is a clinicalstage public lixt pharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering drugs for more effective treatments for cancer lixte has identified molecular signaling pathways altered in disease states and designed compounds that can safely target them in animal models the current drug portfolio includes inhibitors of protein phosphatases that are critical to cell division and dna damage repair and inhibitors of protein deacetylases that regulate pathways of gene expression and protein degradation the phosphatase inhibitors enhance the effectiveness of cytotoxic anticancer drugs in general as well as radiation therapy making them potentially useful for the treatment of many if not all cancers in combination with existing standard chemotherapy regimens and the evolving targeted cytotoxic therapies of personalized cancer medicine the lead compound lb is in phase i trial and has the potential to be firstinclass the deacetylase inhibitors have anticancer activity and in model systems correct enzymes deficiencies underlying several inborn metabolic diseases including gaucher and von hippellindau disease and neurofibromatosis type  lixtes cancer drug development strategy has led to the discovery of novel compounds with the potential to be therapeutically useful against several other important but seemingly disparate diseases the phosphatase inhibitors are in preclinical development for reducing the extent of tissue damage following stroke heart attack and septic shock and the deacetylase inhibitors for prevention
