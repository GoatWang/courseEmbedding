archives  ideascale toggle navigation ideascale blog tag brian berube brian berube and the bogus creek  jessica day  february  0 for the second year in a row ideascale was glad to sponsor brian berube in alaska’s k dog sled race this week i had some time to talk to him about his racing experience please enjoy the interview below team taking a break on a nice day is how many years have you participated in the k and how did you get into it brian berube it’s actually the bogus creek  that i do and i’ve been doing this for just for a year i got started last october i’ve always loved dogs and after you start you find yourself in the middle of eighteen lives that totally depend on you and then you’re sort of just “in it” i knew the daughter of a woman who couldn’t run last year and so i got started from there is you race with a team of ten dogs what are their names and how do you determine what order they race in bb well there are eighteen in the kennel and after working with them all year you pick the ten best for the race the lead dogs were steve nash and foxy the lead dogs are the smartest one in this case i sort of balance them out i have one smart one and one kind of ballsy one the smart one steers and the ballsy one keeps ‘em moving forward the rest of the dogs in the middle are the raw horse power that’s sugar and diva as the swing dogs and posey honey benito and brandi as the team dogs then link the stink and berube are the wheel dogs and the wheel dogs are the ones that pull you from that starting position and get you moving again they are generally the largest and strongest dogs team departing the chute is how do you train the dogs and yourself to run a race like the bogus creek  we train pretty much yearround in the summer we’re doing 0 minute pulls where they pull me around on a fourwheeler in neutral starting in late august we’re running on the bare tundra they pull the sled on the tundra and over time we just keep increasing the mileage i’d say we had at least 7 miles of training before the race i run them about  times a week some days it’s  miles and sometimes it’s just  and it just kind of varies in between you figure out which dogs work best together what sort of work they want to do there are a thousand different nuances that you have to learn about each dog before you can use the to their fullest potential is how do you protect those paws in the snow the dog yard bb well these dogs are bred to run and that means that their paws are pretty resilient for the longer runs we put boot all the dogs it’s basically just a sock with a piece of velcro over the top of it their feet are really pretty tough though i mean they’re incredibly hardy animals they deal with quite a lot like in the summer on the tundra there are just bumps and all sorts of different terrain that humans cannot even walk through without injuring themselves if you notice that one dog is having trouble you work your way up the legs to see what’s wrong but i’ve only ever had one dog even limp or anything i mean they’re selectively bred to do this over the course of a couple thousand years – so they’re pretty solid is what was the race like this year bb the temperature was actually pretty good for the race this year somewhere around 0 degrees – last year it was  and on the way home we had some pretty bad wind and really the snow’s not very deep – it’s mostly just windblown and icy in some of the more wooded parts the snow was deep and that tired my dogs out since they aren’t so used to that but still – the trail’s pretty wellmarked every hundred there’s a stick with a reflector on it basically it was about a 0hour ride total is do the dogs rest bb yes every 7 miles there’s a mandatory fourhour break we feed the dogs and let them sleep if we didn’t do that the dogs would just run themselves into the ground i mean – they really have this natural desire to just run forever it’s when dogs go camping like their whole purpose in life is what happens to the retired dogs bb we keep them they’re really pack animals and so it’s hard to separate them from the rest of the dogs and just send them to live in different homes they all live together all the time and that’s the only life that they know the old school of thought was to put down the animal after it couldn’t run them any more but we want to make sure that we find them families where they can still stay together – isolating them is actually pretty cruel they just howl for their family all night long for puppies it’s different they aren’t as embedded in the pack culture and can still go to a family they’re great dogs they’re pretty much bred to have an eventemper and they’re pretty mild mannered the team on a cloudy day is how did ideascale contribute to your team bb well apart from sponsoring me for the race rob also comes along and helps with dogs from time to time during the race he comes out at different checkpoints and brings some food to the camp this year he even gave a dog i had to drop a ride home in his lap also – they gave me a really nice sweater this year so ideascale contributes in a couple of different ways is so will you run again next year bb definitely we had two older dogs that ran with us this year one’s  and one’s  but we still have at least  to pick from for next year but the majority berube and girlfriend at the starting line of the team will still be the same thanks for representing ideascale in the k brian we definitely look forward to next year’s race as well popular tagscrowdsourcing ideascale innovation open
