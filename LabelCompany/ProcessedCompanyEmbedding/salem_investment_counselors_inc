and young from personal users to businesses and now even hospitals mobile phones have become an essential part of the modern eco system without one people have difficulty finding employment and leave themselves negatively exposed to emergencies the vast majority of american adults    now own a cell phone this has resulted in the massive growth of businesses supplying and supplementing this market of which itll is now becoming a key player the otcqb is an elite tier of the over the counter markets these are companies that have audited financials available are current in their reporting have verified management and shareholders and additional disclosure requirements to meet all in all this signifies that itll is on the ball and doing business the right way morningstar rates otcitll at an excellent  stars meaning it is of fair value the rating is determined by three factors a stocks current price morningstars estimate of the stocks fair value and the uncertainty rating of the fair value the bigger the discount the higher the star rating once again an excellent omen for savvy investorsbreaking news itll successfully closes acquisition with completion of definitive agreements with such immense growth in the industry and corporate giants dominating the arena we frequently see small companies either grow exponentially or get bought out before they become a threat this is where otc itll comes into play their goal is to deliver market disruptive products and pricing to the millions of consumers who are looking for better deals in the mobile phone and application space since itll is a public company we believe this is an excellent opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on the booming industry we’ve done some digging and have laid out  reasons why we believe itll may be the most profitable stock play of  breaking news itll successfully closes acquisition with completion of definitive agreements massive telecom acquisitions are happening all the time theyre so common in fact we barely notice the billions of dollars that are flying between these massive corporations month after month for example in  alone weve already seen several major acquisitions telecom service provider gtt communications announced in june that it plans to buy network connectivity provider global capacity for  million in cash and  million shares of gtt common stock we also saw that in april windstream announced its plan to acquire cloudbased unified communications provider broadview networks in an allcash transaction worth  million and if that isnt enough in march zayo group holdings inc closed its  billion acquisition of electric lightwave the company formerly known as integra telecom all of this happened in just the last few monthsall this makes you wonder why this is happening and whether itll has what it takes to dance with the big guys well it is our belief that the telecom giants scoop up the smaller competitive companies because they are a danger to their business model big companies like verizon are making money hand over fist  why stop when you can just scoop up the competition and keep business going as usualitll has made it clear that their goal is to be affordable and disruptive a similar situation took place in canada some years ago when a company named wind mobile came into play over a few short years wind grew a massive user base simply because their plans were significantly cheaper than the competition recently shaw bought them out for  billion as a result of all this our opinion of the itll business model is excellent  weve seen this business model work before  if you’ve missed putting this on your stock tracker take a moment and do it right now for more information about intelligent cloud resources

giants a company has to hold a competitive edge to stand out through our due diligence we have found this to be undoubtedly true for itll the cornerstone to every customer seeking a cell provider is the smartphones that they have available smartphones are expensive for your average consumer as many flagship phones sit around the  mark itll has seemed to solve this problem by partnering up with the smartphone manufacturer leagoo these phones have everything that the typical consumer wants at a fraction of the cost they are well built stylish powerful and power through daily functions like

the profiled issuer and  or third party paying us our publication of the information is known as a “campaign” this information may be sent to potential investors at different times that are minutes hours days or even weeks apart typically the trading volume and price of a profiled issuer’s securities increases after the information is provided to the first group of investors therefore the later an investor receives the information the more likely it is that he will suffer trading losses if they purchase the securities of a profiled issuer late in a campaign we are paid to advertise the
