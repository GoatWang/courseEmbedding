strong global growth profile infrastructure is one of the fastest growing asset classes globally with target infrastructure allocations increasing significantly over recent years we expect portfolio allocations to infrastructure assets to rise further in coming years as the benefits of investing in infrastructure are increasingly recognised there is a significant need for new infrastructure in both developed and developing economies it is estimated that approximately us trillion needs to be invested in global infrastructure by  this means there will be a broad and growing range of infrastructure investment opportunities global investments view key assets preqin insight learn about our capabilities direct infrastructure listed infrastructure abn in assets under management expertise on the ground on four continents more than  years of market leadership why infrastructure in our view the benefits of this asset class offer a compelling fit for investors seeking a blend of stability and attractive returns low volatility infrastructure assets are often regulated and exhibit strong monopolistic qualities with high barriers to entry these characteristics mean infrastructure assets can be less volatile than traditional asset classes stable longterm cash flows longduration asset lives may make for stable longterm cash flows linked to inflation natural diversification a range of subsectors within infrastructure may offer natural opportunities to build welldiversified portfolios that can perform throughout the economic cycle why amp capital amp

infrastructure’s low correlation to most other asset classes may help insulate investors from financial market volatility and often offer income streams higher than those typically available in today’s low interest rate environment listed infrastructure securities global listed infrastructure companies may offer investors higher dividend or coupon payments than global equities and global bonds respectively as operating margins are often high and cash flows are very stable it may also offer investors a highly liquid way to gain exposure to infrastructure unlisted infrastructure equity direct infrastructure investment may provide diversification benefits and attractive riskadjusted returns as well as low correlation with most other asset classes  as of  december    preqin global
