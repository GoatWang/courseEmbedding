when choosing a traditional alarm company we listened to all the things you dislike about traditional burglar alarm companies then fixed them traditional alarm company simplisafe a better way old wired technology traditional alarm companies want to put wires in your walls because they know that ripping their wires out is hard and expensive stateoftheart  wireless technology we took microchip technology and developed smarter software to offer you a robust and reliable security system with wireless there are no holes in your walls monitoring is  a month ours is just  a month simplisafe protects your home with cops monitoring  named best monitoring in the industry by the central station alarm association the moment you let them put a system into your home you’re typically locked into a  contract with no way out no annual contracts our customers stay with us because of our excellent product quality and helpful customer support autorenewal clauses grab another  from you if you don’t cancel them within  days of the end of your threeyear term forget to cancel you’re legally trapped—there’s no way out no hidden charges no commitments no sneaky tricks many frustrated customers just google “alarm system complaints” or “alarm contract complaints” and see for yourself growing by word of mouth see our facebook fan page uses a phone line to connect to the monitoring center burglars sometimes cut phone lines uses its builtin and independent cellular connection which is  seconds faster and is uncuttable no phone line required prices are kept high because there are so many middlemen and salespeople involved we don’t have expensive salespeople or middlemen that’s how we can afford to keep our prices so low installation typically costs between  and  you’ll need to take a day off of work while the installer drills holes in your walls setup is easier than you could ever imagine no tools needed just adhesive pads the unit actually talks to you while you’re setting it up one of our customers purchased a second system for his daughter’s home and was “looking forward to the joy of installing it for her” watch our easy installation video to see what he means does easy setup mean the system is flimsy or less secure no quite the opposite no wires means there’s nothing for burglars to cut as soon as you sign up there’s no going back you cannot cancel even if you try we put our money where our mouth is you can try us completely risk free with three amazing guarantees simplisafe comes with a  satisfaction guarantee  satisfaction guaranteed  day money back guarantee  three year product warranty nearly one million americans trustsimplisafe to protect them here’s why dennis r amarillo tx this morning at  am my phone rang it was the simplisafe operator telling me that my alarm was going off i had them call the police and they were there within minutes the glass in the back door had been broken but the system worked perfectly and the intruders ran away we only had to replace a small pane of glass greg w clarksville tn our home was burglarized two weeks ago i purchased a system that night and installed it within the week today the thieves returned and the alarm scared them off the officers were at my home within minutes nothing was taken simplisafe works lauren b tacoma wa we installed our system and within one week the water sensor placed at our water heater set off the alarm sure enough the tp valve had opened on our water heater the monitoring service alerted us in under  seconds no water damage whatsoever way to go simplisafe our system paid for itself that day stephanie t toledo oh i love my system it saved us from thousands of dollars in damage when the power went out in our house in northern ohio on the coldest day in february ° the monitoring center alerted us in florida that the power was out and the temperature in the house was dropping fast we were able to contact an electrician to repair the problem without the system we never would have known and would have had major freeze damage simplisafe is recommended by abc fox news nbc  more “no installation no annual contracts very smart” “everything is included and it’s portable so if you change apartments you can just bring it with you” “david vs goliath simplisafe vs adt simplisafe aims to upstage their larger rivals by giving consumers what they really want even without fancy marketing word is spreading” see review simplisafe is not for you if  you have a huge home if your home is larger than  square feet about the size of a football field—or if it has more than  windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors our advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about  you run a large commercial property such as a shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a system that has cctv or security guards in which case you should
