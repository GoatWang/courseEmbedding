like to say a few words about the substantial progress we have made across many fronts in  and i would like to note that the progress we have seen this year wouldnt have been accomplished without the hard work and ongoing dedication of our general cable team i want to recognize and thank them for this we completed the first year of our three year strategic roadmap we are focusing the company on its core strategic businesses building scale and efficiency in the manufacturing network and supply chain and driving targeted growth in selected markets at the end of this transformation we will become one of the most focused efficient and innovative companies in our industry we start to see some early benefits from the roadmaps but most of the key initiatives and impacts are ahead we are especially pleased with the progress we have made in north america which was a primary focus of the strategic roadmap in the first year all of the roadmap initiatives in north america are in progress and many significant projects will be completed in q and q of this year however it is really nice to see some early results in our north american performance we are working diligently to complete the north america work and continue the ramp up of roadmap initiatives in both europe and latin america as you might remember our roadmap has four key elements first portfolio focus and optimization we examine the businesses in our portfolio focusing on global growth markets and electric utility industrial and communications against our previously disclosed criteria of market leadership operating scale ability to attain an industry leading cost structure and long term sustainable growth potential we now have number one number two or strong number three positions in approximately  of our revenue the second element of our roadmap is developing industry leading cost and efficiency position our vision is to have focused efficient factories an optimized supply chain and a substantial competitive advantage from an industry leading cost positions and this is critical for us as a manufacturing company to achieve this we are doing two things the first is implementing five major projects the majority of which are in north america at this time to consolidate and streamline our manufacturing operations in order to drive scale and efficiency for example in our manufacturing operations nearly half of all of our plants are undergoing substantial project driven change the second thing is implementing supply chain efficiencies including global procurement and a new logistic management system in north america that will leverage our substantial operating scale these initiatives are also progressing well and on schedule the third element of our roadmap is targeted growth partly through targeted share recovery which is happening now we are also positioning the business in faster growing markets such as renewables data communications and grid connectivity and we expect to see more impact from these targeted initiatives later this year finally our growth initiatives based on product and service innovation will have an impact later in the three year plan finally the fourth and what i use the most important component of our roadmap is cultivating a high performance culture it is the people not the plans that drive change in a company and our team is already showing how a high performance culture based on share values can positively impact the business on the ground i and the management team continue to experience a more energized exciting organization and a talented set of team members that are even more invested in the growth and profitability of their company this is a team that is capable of driving substantial change in general cable i look forward to seeing us accomplish this together you know a key takeaway from this year is that in substantial transformation such as the one we are undergoing progress is very seldom linear particularly in the early stages we have had many successes so far and few challenges and we are learning from both as we continue to improve our performance our restructuring initiatives with the exception of one restructuring project in europe are tracking with plan and making substantial progress overall we are on track and confident in our ability to deliver the  million of profit improvement from our roadmap we all know that exceptional leadership drives exceptional results especially in the transformation our roadmap and importantly the momentum we built around it have enabled us to attract top talent to our management team over the last six months we have welcomed a new chief financial officer a new chief human resources officer a new leader for latin america and just a few weeks ago a new leader for our north american business among a number of others i am confident that we have the right people in place who have deep talent and proven experience to help us achieve our goals of being more focused efficient and innovative we also expect our new leadership team to contribute to our revitalized culture by having high performance leaders to guide and inspire enthusiastic teams this is a key piece of the new general cable we are building now i would like to give a high level overview of our q performance and outlook and then i will turn it over to matti for a full discussion overall adjusted operating income was flat year over year as the impact of rising metal prices and stronger results in north america were offset by the substantial easing of our subsea project business in europe and the continuing weak macro environment in latin america unfortunately relative to our expectations our performance for the quarter with the low end of our guidance range as we experienced an implementation delay for restructuring project in europe in north america we continue to build momentum we are driving our restructuring initiatives forward while capturing projects in our electric utility and construction business as unit volume increased  yearoveryear in the fourth quarter we are pleased with the improvements we are seeing as we generated adjusted operating income of  million of the fourth quarter inclusive of the metals benefit sales and bookings activity as well as efficiency improvement have increased in each sequential month of the quarter overall north americas performance in  was encouraged and we are executing well and beginning to see the early benefits of the strategic roadmaps in europe we recorded an adjusted operating loss of  million which was down  million yearoveryear mainly due to the dropping of the subsea project business which we have anticipated and discussed for many quarters now we have strong businesses in europe with good market positions and excellent technology we continue to experience strong demand for high voltage and extra high voltage turnkey projects our data communications business grew  this year our subsea project business as anticipated is now at talk level we are beginning to bring a stronger backlog for the future at the same time one of our restructuring projects in europe is behind schedule and still in the implementation phase we have maintained our market position there but we are experiencing higher operating cost at the moment we are executing a plan to complete the project over the next few quarters and fully realize the benefits we do expect to see sequential improvement in adjusted operating income in europe as we move through  in latin america we continue to operate around breakeven from an adjusted operating income perspective while our volume for the fourth quarter was up yearoveryear principally driven by our lower value add product category such as rod we continue to expect a choppy and uneven demand environment that we have seen throughout the year excluding rod sales unit volume was flat yearoveryear for the fourth quarter we had a focus plan to improve our performance in north america in the current challenging environment which consists of fixing the fundamentals of the business and optimizing our channels to market we recently hired a very accomplished executive to lead the latin american region on a dedicated basis we also hired a very experienced executive to run our business in brazil with this refreshed team in place i believe we will see steady progress in latin america over the next year and our plan calls for sequential growth in adjusted operating income through  looking ahead to the first quarter of  we are expecting unit volumes to be up low single digits yearonyear in north america we continue to see the improved sales and booking trends continue into january during my visits and conversations with customers over the last few months many or most commented on the noticeable uptick in project and bidding activity let me summarize our outlook for key markets in north america the utility segment outlook is positive with particular strength in renewables and by the way we have a capacity addition coming later this year to help us serve the strong demand the industrial segment we are seeing a strengthening backlog for q and coding activity remains strong in nonresidential construction coding activity remains strong in december and again in january one of our customers anecdotally noted that they saw more code activity in january than in all of first quarter of  now i want to emphasize that the uptick we are seeing here is incrementally modest but it is broad based across our customers and markets in north america it is too early to tell if the recent improvement is sustainable but the trends i am seeing are encouraging in europe the overall growth is stable in the low single digits with a strong demand outlook in particular brought to rest flow turnkey project business latin america continues to be choppy and uneven similar to what we have experienced over the last year although progress in europe and latin america is lower than what we have expected at the beginning of  i am confident that we are on the right track as i said north america has been primary focus of the roadmap and its net worth exceeded most targets in  by continuing to implement these successful initiatives across the whole of the business we will have a more productive efficient organization that will position us to more effectively compete and create value for shareholders with those comments i will now handover the call to matti matti masanovich thanks mike turning to slide  q  key financial results net sales for the quarter were flat yearonyear as rising up prices and higher unit volume was offset by lower european subsea project activity and the sale of the companys north america ignition wired business which was completed at the end of the second quarter  volume as measured in metal pounds was up  yearoveryear as demand improved across all three regions driven principally by demand for electric utility construction and rod products adjusted operating income of  million was down  million versus the prior year as favorable metal cost impacts higher unit volume and favorable north america operating performance helped to partially offset the impact of lower project activity in the european subsea power business and in the sale of our north america nationwide cable business turning to slide  in north america net sales were flat yearoveryear rising metal prices and higher unit volume helped to offset the impact of the sale of our ignition wire business unit volume for the region was up  yearoveryear our electric utility business including both transmission and distribution was up  yearoveryear as spending improved for renewables and grid maintenance work as compared to last year we experienced a sharp decline in demand in the end of the year we continue to grow our position in our construction based product categories including both copper and aluminum building wire which are favorable yearoveryear in the fourth quarter by  and  respectively demand for industrial cables including oil and gas was down yearoveryear but the pace of decline has slowed substantially as these businesses were down on average  yearoveryear for the fourth quarter throughout the year these businesses were down yearonyear on average in the range of  to  per quarter on a full year basis oil and gas was down  adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of  million improved approximately  million yearonyear principally due to the impact of north america cost savings initiatives that are beginning to take hold with respect to lean manufacturing and purchasing savings as well the impact of selling lower average cost inventory into a higher metal cost environment and the impact of higher unit volumes due to growth in key product lines overall demand of  was flat versus  we did however experience growth in jour electric utility distribution and construction businesses as we capture projects for grid expansion and reinforcements and recapture share in our construction businesses these trends were offset by the uneven market demand experienced throughout the year through our industrial and specialty cables business particularly those tied to oil and gas applications we are monitoring order patterns closely as we are encouraged with the solid pace of shipments and bookings to the first month of the year turning to slide  europe net sales were flat yearonyear as the impact of rising metal prices and higher unit volume helped to offset the impact of lower subsea project activity unit volume was favorable  yearonyear as the company and land based turn key projects for the electricity grid interconnection projects throughout europe as well as its energy cable business the base business for flow business comprised of industrial construction products continues to be under pressure throughout the region adjusted operating loss for the fourth quarter of  million was down  million compared to the fourth quarter of  principally due to lower activity in the subsea cable business as several major turnkey projects were completed and closed out as mike mentioned we are experiencing a lock in the subsea project activity as we work to replenish our backlog with solid tender activity we are actively biding on a number of projects which include both longer term projects as well as shorter run smaller scale projects our project backlog including both subsea and land was  million at the end of the fourth quarter turning to slide  latin america net sales increased yearonyear by  driven by rise in metal prices and higher unit volume unit volume improved  yearonyear of demand of rod products which as mike alluded have a lower margin profile excluding rod shipments unit volume was flat yearonyear adjusted operating income continues to fluctuate around breakeven while our results are clearly not where we need to be nor we expect them to be we are making progress our businesses in both chile and colombia have performed well this year capturing volume and driving operational improvements overall our businesses throughout the region continue to face a challenging macro environment marked by weak construction spending and growth rates we are continuing to implement our restructuring actions to drive savings and improve operational execution across the region briefly on our divestiture program as of the end of the fourth quarter we have sold or liquidated a majority of our businesses in the asia pacific and africa region generating  million of cash proceeds in the fourth quarter we completed the wind down of operations in south africa we are advancing down the path of exiting the remaining operations including china algeria and angola we are targeting total proceeds from divestitures in the range of  million to  million turning to slide  we provided a summary of our debt maturity profile position as of the fourth quarter net debt of  million was down  million from the end of  due to continued tight management working capital and cash proceeds generated for divestitures for the fourth quarter and full year  we generated strong operating cash flow of  million and  million respectively which is consistent with our expectations capital spending for the fourth quarter and full year was  million and  million respectively approximately  of our capital update for the year was invested in select areas to enable topline growth while the remaining balance represents spending on general maintenance purposes we anticipate our capital spending for  to be between  million  million and to be split along the same basis as  with respect to growth and maintenance projects this level of spending has been in line with our strategic roadmap we currently have  million of availability under our north america and european based credit facility we are well positioned upon the business including working capital requirements restructuring activities capex quarterly dividends and other corporate obligations before providing some additional color on our first quarter outlook i wanted to touch base on the segment of the fcpa matter on slide  at the end of december we reached agreements with the doj and the sec to resolve the respected fcpa related investigations as well as the secs separate accounting investigation related to the companys legacy financial restatements for a total amount of approximately  million we recorded a charge of approximately  million in the fourth quarter  the company made its first payment of approximately  million to the government in january of  the second payment of approximately  million is due at the end of june and the final payment of approximately  million is due at the end of the year the company expects to utilize cash and borrowings on its revolving credit facility to fund these payments general cable remains committed to ethical business practices and over the past two years we have invested significant time and resources to implement a world class compliance program an action that was recognized by the authorities itself finally on slide  our first quarter outlook anticipates net sales in the range of  million to  million adjusted operating income in the range of  million to  million and adjusted earnings per share of  to  our guidance assumes copper and aluminum prices of  and  per pound respectively overall our guidance reflects a solid performance in north america and favorable metal cost impacts as well as lower average cost inventory as we sell lower cost inventory into the metal market with improving results in latin america and europe as we move throughout the year that concludes our prepared remarks and i will turn the call back over to the operator who will assist us in taking your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of shawn harrison with longbow research please go ahead shawn harrison hi good morning mike mcdonnell good morning shawn shawn harrison hopefully an easy question first before i delve into some other restructuring but maybe if you could just talk about are you i wouldnt think much of net importer of any substantial product into the usa and just kind of your thinking on border tax dynamics matti masanovich shawn its matti i will take the question you know its a little early to kind of make have an opinion on whats going on because there is very different proposals out there so its pretty fluid and there is no clear direction on any law changes there has been discussion on border adjustments we do have a business in mexico and we do have a business in canada and we do import product into united states so i would tell you though we have a large manufacturing presence in the united states and we could share the production to the usa one of our major competitors in the automotive business are very similar situated to us one of my background is also automotive and the automotive business is pretty heavily invested in mexico so i do think there is potential impact the percentage we are talking about is  but i think we have got the ability to ship production if need be andor you know i think its a little too early to tell where its going to land at this stage shawn harrison thats helpful matti second just on the restructuring if we could talk about where you are at in terms of dollars of savings generated to date i thought it was something if i added everything up  million on supply chain and logistics and the remainder on manufacturing adjustments to your total number and so if you could just walk me through of maybe what you think  was in terms of run rates of both categories where you expect  to end up given the delay in europe and what flows into  if possible mike mcdonnell shawn i can give you some high color on that first let me just point out we are one year into a three year plan and the progress here is never linear especially early on and the results are back end loaded by design if we break that  million down which is our targeted profit improvement from our roadmap approximately twothirds of that is overall cost and in that cost bucket there is a manufacturing bucket and a supply chain bucket  million and  million respectively for the  million and then the other  million is growth  million of that  million is organic market growth and  million of that  million is from targeted growth initiatives both in terms of leveraging our channels improving our service proposition customers and also innovation and technology of products and services of products so kind of lay all of that out and i have been saying for the last three quarters that we expected to begin the sea path late in  and the first wave of savings would come from things like our lean initiatives scrap initiatives procurement which we have gotten some real traction on and most of that savings in late  coming in later in  would be in north america thats been the primary focus of the roadmap as we move into  we have these five major projects and a number of smaller ones too they are all expected to be completed later in  and by the end of  there will be one or two going into  but these five of the manufacturing side would be largely done late this year our savings will step up at that point in time and we will be capturing a big part of that manufacturing and supply chain set we havent mentioned that yet and we will do that soon we plan to have an investor day later this year and we will take everybody through that and to upgrade our queue to integrate detail where you are also introduce you to our management team so right now we are pleased with what we have gotten in  that was kind of our expectation late in the year it was some procurement and some lean and little bit of the targeted share recovery that i talked about earlier expect that momentum to continue to build in north america particularly in the second half of the year in north america where we will see a step change from these projects completing these are projects like many of the consolidations we referred to projects like our procurement projects like our transportation management system etcetera they have a sizable impact these projects and we have got great line of sight on this in europe we have got this restructuring project to be done then there is more behind that in terms of our roadmap but thats not really right now front and center we do expect to complete that over the next few quarters and then we will start to layer in more of the roadmap savings there then latin america we have got a good plan a new management team there a new leader the first time we have ever had a dedicated leader for latin america in our history and he brings tremendous experience and operational savvy to the region he is living in the region and speaks the language as well and so excited about the progress that we are going to make there i think the way to look at both europe and latin america in  is slow and steady progress you know sequentially and that will probably get most of the benefits in the year  in the third year of the plan so shawn has that helped kind of lay out kind of where we are and what we are seeing where we expect to be shawn harrison it does mike and if i may just two brief follow ups i think the last analyst you had kind of ebit or ebitda margin target for north america it would be at the upper end of what you would be doing it would be driving a lot of the company do you think it will close to where you want the ebit margins to be exiting the year in north america mike mcdonnell i think we are shawn again north america has been the primary focus of roadmap so far thats not to say we havent been working in latin america and europe and north america we got the majority of our resource base here majority of the company so we wanted to make this the first place where we really made it successful and then leverage those earnings out into the second and third year so in q i might add we demonstrated  top ready margin in north america already which frankly a little bit ahead of my expectation i think we saw a little bit more from our roadmap in q than we expected i am just really pleased with the north american business it is performing and developing expectations and we will hit those targets shawn harrison perfect and then on europe can you hit your targets without subsea coming back matti masanovich yes because if you recall that investor day and shawn here we try to be as transparent as we can be we backed out the peak to trough contribution from subsea in our  results so if you remember that shawn that bridge you know there is a big down we backed down  million from subsea look anything we get from it now is upside to go against our  million target but we are not counting on being the peak again remember that peak was associated with baltic  baltic  the biggest project subsea project in our companys history and that is now completed mike mcdonnell and i also think its fair to say that theres no project as that project there is some tender bid activity there and is within our contrasted capability so we are seeing that in particular so thanks matti we dont like to stay in troughs we dont like troughs and neither does the team over there they are fighting hard in fact i am going to be there next week with them to review to the backlog which is beginning to grow again but i dont want to get too ahead of our skies on that right now we can do with where we at today shawn harrison perfect thanks so much mike mcdonnell you are welcome shawn operator and your next question comes from the line of george godfrey from cl king your line is open george godfrey thank you good morning gentlemen couple of questions first question looking at the three year roadmap for capex and cash flow free cash flow the capex figuring cumulative still targeting to be  million matti masanovich yes we are on track with our strategic roadmap to spend thats correct on track george godfrey okay so  million this year  million to the high end of next year so that would leave a bucket of about  million if need to matti masanovich correct george godfrey okay thank you and then if i look at the adjusted eps of the first quarter the outlook there the restructuring divestiture costs  million and  a share is that a reasonable estimate for the future quarters on where you think indiscernible mike mcdonnell hey george we are having difficulty hearing the question could you repeat it it is coming a little up on the line george godfrey yes i am sorry hopefully this is better in the q outlook restructuring divestiture cost  million or  a share for q  is that a reasonable baseline for quarters two three  four or do you think that trends down as we go throughout the year matti masanovich i think its going to trend down throughout the year thats kind of the roadmap spending and so that will trend down throughout the year george godfrey okay and then following up on that the asia pacific income lost  a quarter until that business is sold is that a reasonable expectation as the year goes out by quarter matti masanovich yes i would think that it is a reasonable expectation on go forward basis correct george godfrey okay and then looking at the rest thing at those pieces in asia pacific and africa is that something you think you could have one by the end of this year or does this carry into  matti masanovich my goal is to have that done by the end of this year george godfrey okay and then just the last question if we think of the demand picture in each of the three regional i understand what we said about latin america and europe being a slow steady improvement and north america perhaps being stronger the visibility beyond the next six months in the  does the historical trends in the business could make you think that  could be a better year for  or is that too early to tell indiscernible geographical areas mike mcdonnell you know we have good visibility three to six months out just given that half of our business is project based and so we have some pretty good visibility and i guess the thing i am encouraged about is the momentum we are seeing right now which i think speaks well to the potential for a better first half and that jury is still out in terms of how that momentum translates into later    there are lots of puts and takes here you know overall i talk to a lot of ceos out there i think we are feeling better about the future than we were feeling three or six months ago in terms of north america and we are seeing the right kinds of things starting to happen george godfrey okay thank you very much mike mcdonnell sure operator and that concludes our question and answer session i will now turn the call back over to gavin bell gavin bell very good
