great gamble on medical product company ipo  checkcap ltd  checkcap ltd nasdaqchek  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»great gamble on medical product company ipo  checkcap ltdfeb  about checkcap ltd chek apbk capital special situations portfolio strategy macro commoditiessummarycheckcaps technology could revolutionize a large segment of the medical diagnostics industrythe diagnostic technology is well poised for quick adoption by doctors patients and insurerscheckcap expects quick regulatory approval and commercializationoverview checkcap ltd nasdaqchek is an early clinicalstage medical diagnostic products company based in israel the company is currently developing a single product used in the diagnosis of colon and rectal colorectal cancer their product is capsule and imagingsystem which can be swallowed and does not require lengthy fasts or cleansed the capsule then allows xrays to image the colon this method is an alternative to the colonoscopy a more invasive diagnostic technology checkcaps upside potential is enormous the company offers a keysolution to a major medical shortcoming for patient and doctors it deeply underprices its substitute making insurance coverage easily justifiable and has a promising outlook for regulatory approval changing medicine colorectal cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer and is the second leading cause of death due to cancer in the us a leading driver in the mortality rate is the timing of detection source cancergov one of the reasons patients avoid screening and detection for colorectal cancer is the invasiveness and displeasure associated with screening the current and most commonly used method of screening is the colonoscopysigmoidoscopy the checkcap imaging system is very different it is an ingestible pillshaped capsule that uses xray technology to image the digestive system source checkcap the xray imaging and data could potentially even be converted to d renderings of the colon providing doctors a very easy and accurate alternative as a result this method could easily create better adoption rates of screening amongst patients being the more pleasant alternative should propel patient and doctor adoption of the technology insurability according to costhelpercom the average cost of a colonoscopy before insurance coverage is just over  and a patients responsibility is determined by type of insurance coverage that simply means someone is paying  for the colonoscopy the cost is in large part due to the time it takes to prep the patient the nursing care the lab work and the doctors time to complete now imagine the capsule  beyond purchasing the technology and the cost associated with reading the results does all that work without the requirement of handson time and prep work if the technology is massproduced it can easily underprice the colonoscopy by thousands of dollars even if the technology is not as accurate as the colonoscopy insurance companies will not have a problem covering it due to the cost savings not to mention the increased potential to prevent even more costly latestage colorectal cancer treatments if the technology is as accurate or more than the colonoscopy insurance companies will prefer this treatment which could eventually phase out colonoscopies for the majority of diagnostic cases in any event there should be no limitations to adoption given the fact that insurance coverage will be easy to obtain approval and clinical studies checkcap has already completed a clinical proofofconcept study that focused on the safety and feasibility of the imaging system the study focused on cases and produced very promising results allowing the company to move forward the company has now moved on to subject study which will more extensively access feasibility and set the ground work for clinical approval in both europe and the united states additionally the company has already been moving forward with presubmission meeting with the us fda given the current timing the company expects to launch their product commercially to europe in  and to the us in  summary based on the current offering per share price range of  checkcap is looking to sell  million shares this would result in just under  million shares outstanding and at  average a market value of  million dollars this is a very bargain price for a technology that could potentially revolutionize the colonoscopy industry and significantly improve colorectal cancer detection however investors should be aware of the risks investing in a company at the very early stages of clinical testing the method has not been proven to meet all of the regulatory guidelines and therefore may never make it to market for investors looking for a gamble or a great company to keep an eye on they
