light of future developments we caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties overview we are a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel medicines to address serious medical conditions for individuals who need new or better treatment options we used a scientific approach to engineer several proteasebased therapeutic candidates we are focusing our product development efforts in the field of hemostasis the process that regulates bleeding and have a mission to develop valuable therapies for individuals with hemophilia we are applying our substantial expertise in protease engineering and our proprietary product discovery platform to create engineer and characterize protease drug candidates proteases regulate several complex biological cascades or sequenced biochemical reactions including the coagulation cascade a mechanism of blood clotting in hemophilia and nonhemophilia settings and the complement cascade that causes inflammation and tissue damage in certain diseases our protease expertise allowed us to improve the biochemical and pharmacological properties of currently marketed hemophilia protease drugs specifically factors viia ix and xa and to create completely novel proteases that cleave diseasecausing proteins specifically complement factor  c for the potential treatment of dry agerelated macular degeneration dry amd and renal delayed graft function dgf our most advanced program is a highly potent nextgeneration coagulation factor viia protease variant marzeptacog alfa activated formerly cb d that has successfully completed an intravenous phase  clinical trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and coagulation activity in individuals with severe hemophilia a and b with and without an inhibitor we expect to advance marzeptacog alfa activated into the phase  portion of a phase  subcutaneous prophylaxis efficacy trial in  our next most advanced hemophilia program a highly potent factor ix protease variant cb disu is ind approved in south korea we expect to initiate a phase  subcutaneous dosing trial for cb disu in the second quarter of  the substantially enhanced potency of marzeptacog alfa activated and cb disu compared with existing treatment options may allow for effective subcutaneous prophylactic treatment of individuals with hemophilia a or b with an inhibitor or individuals with hemophilia b respectively catalysts engineered hemostasis proteases are designed to overcome current treatment limitations by allowing delivery via subcutaneous injection which we believe will facilitate effective prophylactic treatment especially in children and ultimately deliver substantially better outcomes for individuals with hemophilia subcutaneous dosing results in progressive increases in the levels of our protease factors until they reach a stable blood level therapeutic target range ideally mild hemophilia to normal conversely dosing by intravenous infusions results in very high factor levels in the blood initially but the factor level then falls rapidly to a trough level at a range that is measured as moderate or severe hemophilia triggering the next dose stable factor levels could potentially yield a significant improvement in outcomes and have the added benefit of convenience over competing intravenous therapeutics particularly when administered to children where venous access is challenging we also have several factor xa variants that have demonstrated efficacy in several preclinical models and have the potential to be used as a universal procoagulant we have delayed initiating further work on our factor xa therapeutic program at this time to focus our efforts on the factor viia and factor ix clinical programs we continue to explore licensing opportunities for our anticomplement programs in dgf and dry amd so that we can focus our efforts and resources on advancing marzeptacog alfa activated and cb disu through phase  and phase  clinical trials respectively we estimate the total market for our product candidates is  billion based on industry reports annual worldwide sales in  for factor viia recombinant products for individuals with hemophilia a or b with an inhibitor were approximately  billion and prothrombin complex concentrate products used to treat individuals with hemophilia a or b with an inhibitor were  billion worldwide sales in  for factor ix products for individuals with hemophilia b were approximately  billion on june   we entered into a research and license agreement with wyeth pharmaceuticals inc subsequently acquired by pfizer whereby we and pfizer collaborated on the development of novel human factor viia products and we granted pfizer the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the licensed products on a worldwide basis on april   pfizer notified us that it was exercising its right to terminate the research and license agreement effective june   accordingly we revised the expected period of performance to end on june   and the deferred revenue balance was fully amortized as of that date on december   we signed a definitive agreement related to the termination of the pfizer agreement pursuant to this termination agreement pfizer granted us an exclusive license to pfizers proprietary rights for manufacturing materials and processes that apply to factor viia variants cb a and marzeptacog alfa activated pfizer also transferred to us the ind application and documentation related to the development manufacturing and testing of the factor viia products as well as the orphan drug designation pursuant to this agreement we agreed to make contingent cash payments to pfizer in an aggregate amount equal to up to  million payable upon the achievement of clinical regulatory and commercial milestones following commercialization of any covered product pfizer would also receive a singledigit royalty on net product sales on a countrybycountry basis for a predefined royalty term in september  we signed a license and collaboration agreement with isu abxis pursuant to which we licensed our proprietary human factor ix products to isu abxis for initial development in south korea under the agreement isu abxis is responsible for manufacturing preclinical development activities and clinical development through a proofofconcept phase  study in individuals with hemophilia b we have the sole rights and responsibility for worldwide development manufacture and commercialization of factor ix products after phase  development isu abxis may exercise its right of first refusal to acquire commercialization rights in south korea in which case they would be entitled to profit sharing on worldwide sales isu abxis paid us an upfront fee of  million and is obligated to pay to us contingent milestonebased payments on the occurrence of certain defined development events of which one has been achieved as of march   collaboration and license revenue related to the isu abxis agreement during the three months ended march   and  was  million and  million respectively that reflect the amortization of the upfront fee over the estimated period of our performance obligations which are estimated to conclude in february  and  million recorded in march  for a milestone earned by us we had a deferred revenue balance of  million as of march   related to the isu abxis collaboration we have never been profitable and have incurred significant operating losses in each year since inception our net losses were  million and  million for the three months ended march   and  respectively as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of  million substantially all our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations we expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue the preclinical manufacturing and clinical development and seek regulatory approval for our drug candidates and our expenses associated with operating as a public company in addition our operating losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to timing of preclinical clinical development programs and regulatory approval financial operations overview contract revenue our contract revenue was generated by recognizing revenue from the amortization of upfront licensee fees for research and development services under our collaboration agreements with isu abxis payments made to us under these agreements are recognized over the period of performance for each arrangement we may also be entitled to receive additional milestone payments and other contingent payments upon the occurrence of specific events we have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales to date isu abxis represents  of our total contract revenue for the three months ending march   and  due to the nature of the milestone payments under the remaining collaboration agreement and the nonlinearity of the earnings process associated with certain payments and milestones we expect that our revenue will fluctuate in future periods as a result of the uncertainty of timing related to achievement of milestones research and development expenses research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research such as the discovery and development of our product candidates we recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred research and development expenses consist primarily of the following employeerelated expenses which include salaries benefits and stockbased compensation laboratory and vendor expenses including payments to consultants related to the execution of preclinical nonclinical and clinical studies the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical materials and developing manufacturing processes performing toxicity studies and facilities and other allocated expenses which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities depreciation and amortization expense and other supplies the following table summarizes our research and development expenses during the three months ended march   and  in thousands three months ended march    personnel costs     preclinical research   clinical manufacturing   facility and overhead   total research and development expenses     the largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities including the clinical development of our product candidates we are currently focusing substantially all our resources and development efforts on our clinical pipeline our internal resources employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to individual product candidates or development programs as such we do not maintain information regarding these costs incurred for these research and development programs on a projectspecific basis on september   our board of directors approved reducing our workforce by  employees or approximately  of our workforce consistent with a revised strategic plan to reallocate our resources to our hemostasis programs including our highly potent nextgeneration factor viia variant marzeptacog alfa activated and our highly potent nextgeneration factor ix cb disu this reduction in force was completed by the fourth quarter  and we recorded restructuring charges of  million for the year ended december   in connection with the restructuring we received proceeds of  million for property and equipment from the sale of excess equipment and other assets which are recorded in other income for the year ended december   there was no further expense recorded during the three months ended march   notwithstanding the reduction in force we expect our aggregate research and development expenses will increase during the next few quarters as we continue the preclinical manufacturing and clinical development of our product candidates in the united states particularly the clinical development costs of marzeptacog alfa activated and cb disu due to the termination of the research and license agreement with pfizer we will incur all costs for the marzeptacog alfa activated program however the incurrence of such costs is dependent on whether we will pursue the program on our own or sign a new collaboration and license arrangement with another pharmaceutical or biotech company the process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming we may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for our product candidates the probability of success of each product candidate may be affected by numerous factors including clinical data competition manufacturing capability and commercial viability as a result we are unable to determine the duration of and costs to complete our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates successful development of current and future product candidates is highly uncertain completion dates and costs for our research programs can vary significantly for each current and future product candidate and are difficult to predict thus we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the costs we will incur in the development of our product candidates we anticipate we will make determinations as to which programs and product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program and product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific success of early research programs results of ongoing and future clinical trials our ability to enter into collaborative agreements with respect to programs or potential product candidates as well as ongoing assessments as to each current or future product candidates commercial potential on may   we signed a development and manufacturing services agreement with cmc icos biologics inc cmc pursuant to which cmc will conduct manufacturing development and upon successful development of the manufacturing process manufacture marzeptacog alfa activated that we intend to use in its clinical trials we will own all intellectual property developed in such manufacturing development activities that are specifically related to marzeptacog alfa activated and will have a royaltyfree and perpetual license to use cmcs intellectual property to the extent reasonably necessary to make marzeptacog alfa activated including commercial manufacturing we have agreed to a total of  million in payments to cmc pursuant to the initial statement of work under the agreement subject to completion of applicable work stages in the event that clinical manufacturing batches need to be cancelled or rescheduled we would be obligated to pay for a portion of cmcs manufacturing fees less certain fees that cmc is able to mitigate the initial term of the agreement is ten years or if later until all stages under outstanding statements of work have been completed either party may terminate the agreement in its entirety upon written notice of a material uncured breach or upon the other partys bankruptcy and we may terminate the agreement upon prior notice for any reason in addition each party may terminate the agreement in the event that the manufacturing development activities cannot be completed for technical or scientific reasons as of march   we have  million in payment obligations to cmc remaining under the agreement general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs allocated expenses and other expenses for outside professional services including legal human resources audit and accounting services personnel costs consist of salaries bonus benefits and stockbased compensation we incur expenses associated with operating as a public company including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the sec and nasdaq stock market llc nasdaq additional insurance expenses additional audit expenses investor relations activities sarbanesoxley compliance expenses and other administrative expenses and professional services we expect such expenses to continue interest and other income net interest and other income consists primarily of the changes in fair value of the derivative liability the derivative liability is associated with the redeemable convertible notes we issued immediately prior to the closing of the merger in august  the accounting for the redeemable convertible notes which are convertible into shares of our common stock requires us to bifurcate the derivative liability and account for it as a derivative liability at its estimated fair value upon issuance the derivative liability is remeasured to estimated fair value as of each balance sheet date we will record adjustments to the fair value of the derivative liability at the end of each reporting period until the earlier of the conversion redemption or maturity of the redeemable convertible notes as of march   and december   the fair value of the derivative liability was immaterial
