kentucky equine research staff · october   corn a traditional component of horse feed has found a wider use in the manufacture of bioplastics traditionally made from petroleum plastics are increasingly biobased which means they are made from renewable resources the newest forms are also completely biodegradablecorn was one of the first grains used in the manufacture of bioplastics and feed industry leaders were thrown into competition for a finite supply of grain a positive note for feed manufacturers and horse owners is that many other plant materials besides corn are now being used to make bioplastics while there is still competition from the plastics industry for feed grains and oilseeds plastic can also be made from straw switchgrass pine bark and corn husks researchers are investigating methods of using agricultural waste such as orange peels potato peels and oat hulls surplus stores of wheat a less popular horse feed ingredient than corn are also being utilizedin
