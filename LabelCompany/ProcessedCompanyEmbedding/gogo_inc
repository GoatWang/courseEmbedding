any device that has wifi capability external aircraft antenna connection onboard can be similar under optimal conditions to the experience at wifi hotspots such as coffee shops and hotels in some but not all cases users report connectivity issues when streaming video such youtube and hbogo some users reported speedtestnet benchmarks above  mbits while other users reported low results of  mbits down and  up in january  david p reed reported that gogo service exhibited multiple seconds of latency under load due to bufferbloat the user connects to the gogoinflight network and registers in the

airtoground atgedit gogos atg network is a cellular meaning that there is a handoff when the aircraft moves between service areas radio network that has more than  towers in the continental us alaska and canada the ground stations consist of original airfone airground phone relay stations and newer locations using the  mhz atg band unlike terrestrial cell sites atg ground stations project a directional signal up into the air where airplanes are rather than downward where terrestrial users are however the short wavelength used allows segmentation and other cellular technologies in the same way that terrestrial cellphone technology works the aircraft communicates with the ground stations through an antenna installed on the underbelly of the fuselage equipment in the aircrafts avionics bay converts between proprietary gogo protocols and standard wifi which is distributed into the passenger cabin through multiple interior wireless access point nodes atgedit gogos atg system is a backwards compatible improvement to the previous atg system maximum total download bandwidth has increased from  mbits to  mbits atg has been installed on at least  aircraft gogo can upgrade planes from atg to atg overnight atg is powered by evdo rev b one of the only production applications of the brevision to evdo as part of the cdma standard kuband satelliteedit gogo has satellite

asia africa and australia gogo has also signed an agreement with intelsat for ku band satellite capacity specifically for coverage in the atlantic and northern pacific oceans as well as routes over central and south america asia australia and parts of africa gogo announced in may  that it will partner with satellite equipment provider aerosat to bring a kusatellite solution to commercial

kuband antennas are manufactured by thinkom solutions aeromexico is the first airline to commit to using ku gogo is determined to expand markets for its ku service on november   the company demonstrated ku for two dozen aviation and technology reporters aboard a boeing  the system was able to stream highdefinition videos it was a small horde of “datahungry journalists on board all trying to kill the system” said jason rabinowitz manager of data research for routehappy quoted in bloomberg business gogo claims that the service can provide speeds up to  megabits per second with mbits to be available when satellitebeaming techniques are perfected actual speed is less impressive as discussed in a techtimes summary of some journalists findings during the november   trials speedtest rated it at  mbps downloads a millisecond ping and uploads of  mbps on my first try said timothy j seppala from engadget he added that one drawback is the ping time which varies between  and  milliseconds  the verges chris welch meanwhile observed that upload speeds were almost nonexistent but stressed that casual internet users seldom need to upload anything larger than a picture or a vine video anyway as for streaming it works brilliantly when used by only  people total bandwidth on the media flight was capped at  mbps a gogo press release in september  stated that a japan airlines member jta was then the most recent company to order ku connectivity for its  aircraft more recently in a november   press release the company indicates that   airlines representing more than

that provides inflight cell phone calls and text messaging the product is to be officially launched on commercial jets in  surveillance supportedit in april  it was revealed through a us federal communications commission letter that gogo partnered with government officials to voluntarily develop capabilities to share user data with law enforcement beyond what is required under the federal communications assistance for law enforcement act in  adrienne porter felt a google security engineer discovered during flight on a gogo internetequipped plane that gogo uses fake ssl authentication carrying out a maninthemiddle attack on their users to capture user activity this deliberately fake authentication may be to enable law enforcement monitoring and also data mining of secure communications and criticized the company for its use the company was also criticized by symantec for this issue gogo has a legitimate interest in limiting or blocking video streaming but the way they’ve done it is far overreaching it is not known how long gogo continued the strategy but as a news site for the information security community indicated the issuing of fake ssl certificates has other risks for the user a cyber criminal “acting” as gogo could have performed many tasks without you ever realizing such as blocking or censoring websites capturing plain or encrypted data installing malware or even stealing passwords criticism of business modeledit it has been observed that gogo practices a roach motel type business model that makes it easy to sign up for service via automated means but requires interaction with a customer service representative to effect an immediate cancellation however service for next and future months may be cancelled via email by making it easy to begin paying for service but requiring a recurring monthly subscription even when a shorter term of service may be desired gogo makes it likely for infrequent flyers to be billed in subsequent months for a service they do not intend to use in addition gogo does not send monthly statements so customers are not alerted to the recurring charges the service does offer hour and hour passes that do not incur a recurring charge however this does not change the fact that even those limitedtime services are significantly harder to stop than to initiate gogo claims that to cancel service is as easy as signing up for it and directs subscribers to engage in online chat send email or call via telephone in contrast however the signup process does not require human interaction as of june   gogo provided an online selfservice cancellation option to cancel via my accountcitation needed classaction lawsuitedit in  gogo was the subject of a classaction lawsuit for allegedly not mentioning recurring charges on their website nor notifying customers that these recurring charges would be made a new york federal judge jack weinstein ruled on april   that the suit berkson et al v gogo llc case no cv in the us district court for the eastern district of new york for claims that the company tricked consumers into signing up for automatic monthly renewal of wifi connections was allowed to move forward in an page memorandum and order of the case the judge wrote the average internet user would not have been informed   that he was binding himself to a signinwrap and that the wrap contract

wifi hotspots such as coffee shops and hotels in some but not all cases users report connectivity issues when streaming video such youtube and hbogo some users reported speedtestnet benchmarks above  mbits while other users reported low results of  mbits down and  up in january  david p reed reported that gogo service exhibited multiple seconds of latency under load due to bufferbloat the user

technologies that gogo currently uses has developed or announced airtoground atgedit gogos atg network is a cellular meaning that there is a handoff when the aircraft moves between service areas radio network that has more than  towers in the continental us alaska and canada the ground stations consist of original airfone airground phone relay stations and newer locations using the  mhz atg band unlike terrestrial cell sites atg ground stations project a directional signal up into the air where airplanes are rather than downward where terrestrial users are however the short wavelength used allows segmentation and other cellular technologies in the same way that terrestrial cellphone technology works the aircraft communicates with the ground stations through an antenna installed on the underbelly of the fuselage equipment in the aircrafts avionics bay converts between proprietary gogo protocols and standard wifi which is distributed into the passenger cabin through multiple interior wireless access point nodes atgedit gogos atg system is a backwards compatible improvement to the previous atg system maximum total download bandwidth has increased from  mbits to  mbits atg has been installed on at least  aircraft gogo can upgrade planes from atg to atg overnight atg is powered by evdo rev b one of the only production applications of the brevision to evdo as part of the cdma standard kuband satelliteedit gogo has satellite agreements in place with ses for coverage over the us atlantic ocean and europe and intelsat for coverage over portions of the atlantic and northern pacific oceans as well as routes over south america asia africa and australia gogo has also signed an agreement with intelsat for ku band satellite capacity specifically for coverage in the atlantic and northern pacific oceans as well as routes over central and south america asia australia and parts of africa gogo announced in may  that it will partner with satellite equipment provider aerosat to bring a kusatellite solution to commercial airlines a kusatellite solution will allow gogo to offer airlines connectivity services that extend beyond the united states including transoceanic routes and will serve the needs of some of their airline partners in the nearterm until inmarsats global xpress ka bandsatellite becomes available gogos kuband satellite technology is used for gogos ground to orbit and ku gogo ground to orbitedit gogo ground to orbit uses a kuband satellite antenna for the downlink to the plane and gogos air to ground for uplink from the plane ground to orbit will be in service over the united states and will have peak download speeds of  mbits virgin america will be the launch partner of the new service the kuband satellite antennas used for gto are manufactured by thinkom solutions kuedit ku gogos newest technology uses two kuband antennas one for download and the other for upload gogo claims that ku will have peak speeds of  mbits and has a lowprofile  cm  in tall radome like ground to orbit the kuband antennas are manufactured by thinkom solutions aeromexico is the first airline to commit to using ku gogo is determined to expand markets for its ku service on november   the company demonstrated ku for two dozen aviation and technology reporters aboard a boeing  the system was able to stream highdefinition videos it was a small horde of “datahungry journalists on board all trying to kill the system” said jason rabinowitz manager of data research for routehappy quoted in bloomberg business gogo claims that the service can provide speeds up to  megabits per second with mbits to be available when satellitebeaming techniques are perfected actual speed is less impressive as discussed in a techtimes summary of some journalists findings during the november   trials speedtest rated it at  mbps downloads a millisecond ping and uploads of  mbps on my first try said timothy j seppala from engadget he added that one drawback is the ping time which varies between  and  milliseconds  the verges chris welch meanwhile observed that upload speeds were almost nonexistent but stressed that casual internet users seldom need to upload anything larger than a picture or a vine video anyway as for streaming it works brilliantly when used by only  people total bandwidth on the media flight was capped at  mbps a gogo press release in september  stated that a japan airlines member jta was then the most recent company to order ku connectivity for its  aircraft more recently in a november   press release the company indicates that   airlines representing more than  aircraft have adopted the ku technology for fleet deployment or a trial of the service more specifically in addition to aeroméxico which already has kuequipped jets in the air virgin airlines and delta airlines have confirmed orders for ku service gogo ceo michael small told bloomberg business more than  aircraft are committed to receiving ku productsedit gogo platform

atg on october   gogo announced that japan airlines will begin offering inflight internet service on its domestic fleet of  aircraft which includes boeing  and  aircraft on november   gogo announced gogo text  talk an app that provides inflight cell phone calls and text messaging the product is to be officially launched on commercial jets in  surveillance supportedit in april  it was revealed through a us federal communications commission letter that gogo partnered with government officials to voluntarily develop capabilities to share user data with law enforcement beyond what is required under the federal communications assistance for law enforcement act in  adrienne porter felt a google security engineer discovered during flight on a gogo internetequipped plane that gogo uses fake ssl authentication carrying out a maninthemiddle attack on their users to capture user activity this deliberately fake authentication may be to enable law enforcement monitoring and also data mining of secure communications and criticized the company for its use the company was also criticized by symantec for this issue gogo has a legitimate interest in limiting or blocking video streaming but the way they’ve done it is far overreaching it is not known how long gogo continued the strategy but as a news site for the information security community indicated the issuing of fake ssl certificates has other risks for the user a cyber criminal “acting” as gogo could have performed many tasks without you ever realizing such as blocking or censoring websites capturing plain or encrypted data installing malware or even stealing passwords criticism of business modeledit it has been observed that gogo practices a roach motel type business model that makes it easy to sign up for service via automated means but requires interaction with a customer service representative to effect an immediate cancellation however service for next and future months may be cancelled via email by making it easy to begin paying for service but requiring a recurring monthly subscription even when a shorter term of service may be desired gogo makes it likely for infrequent flyers to be billed in subsequent months for a service they do not intend to use in addition gogo does not send monthly statements so customers are not alerted to the recurring charges the service does offer hour and hour passes that do not incur a recurring charge however this does not change the fact that even those limitedtime services are significantly harder to stop than to initiate gogo claims that to cancel service is as easy as signing up for it and directs subscribers to engage in online chat send email or call via telephone in contrast however the signup process does not require human interaction as of june   gogo provided an online selfservice cancellation option to cancel via my accountcitation needed classaction lawsuitedit in  gogo was the subject of a classaction lawsuit for allegedly not mentioning recurring charges on their website nor notifying customers that these recurring charges would be made a new york federal judge jack weinstein ruled on april   that the suit berkson et al v gogo llc case no cv in the us district court for the eastern district of new york for claims that the company tricked consumers into signing up for automatic monthly renewal of wifi connections was allowed to move forward in an page memorandum and order of the case the judge wrote the average internet user would not have been informed   that he was binding himself to a signinwrap and that the wrap contract thus does not support the venue and arbitration clauses relied upon by defendants see alsoedit boingo wireless connexion by boeing onair panasonic avionics corporation

supportedit in april  it was revealed through a us federal communications commission letter that gogo partnered with government officials to voluntarily develop capabilities to share user data with law enforcement beyond what is required under the federal communications assistance for law enforcement act in  adrienne porter felt a google security engineer discovered during flight on a gogo internetequipped plane that gogo uses fake ssl authentication carrying out a maninthemiddle attack on their users to capture user activity this deliberately fake authentication may be to enable law enforcement monitoring and also data mining of secure communications and criticized the company for its use the company was also criticized by symantec for this issue gogo has a legitimate interest in limiting or blocking video streaming but the way they’ve done it is far overreaching it is not known how long gogo continued the strategy but as a news site for the information security community indicated the issuing of fake ssl certificates has other risks for the user a cyber criminal “acting” as gogo could have performed many tasks without you ever realizing such as blocking or censoring websites capturing plain or encrypted data installing malware or even stealing passwords criticism of business modeledit it has been observed that gogo practices a roach motel type business model that makes it easy to sign up for service via automated means but requires interaction with a customer service representative to effect an immediate cancellation however service for next and future months may be cancelled via email by making it easy to begin paying for service but requiring a recurring monthly subscription even when a shorter term of service may be desired gogo makes it likely for infrequent flyers to be billed in subsequent months for a service they do not intend to use in addition gogo does not send monthly statements so customers are not alerted to the recurring charges the service does offer hour and hour passes that do not incur a recurring charge however this does not change the fact that even those limitedtime services are significantly harder to stop than to initiate gogo claims that to cancel service is as easy as signing up for it and directs subscribers to engage in online chat send email or call via telephone in contrast however the signup process does not require human interaction as of june   gogo provided an online selfservice cancellation option to cancel via my accountcitation needed classaction lawsuitedit in  gogo was the subject of a classaction lawsuit for allegedly not mentioning recurring charges on their website nor notifying customers that these recurring charges would be made a new york federal judge jack weinstein ruled on april   that the suit berkson et al v gogo llc case no cv in the us district court for the eastern district of new york for claims that the company tricked consumers into signing up for automatic monthly renewal of wifi connections was allowed to move forward in an page memorandum and order of the case the judge wrote the average internet user would not have been informed   that he was binding himself to a signinwrap and that the wrap contract thus does not support the venue and arbitration clauses relied upon by defendants see alsoedit boingo wireless connexion by boeing onair panasonic

gogo claims that the service can provide speeds up to  megabits per second with mbits to be available when satellitebeaming techniques are perfected actual speed is less impressive as discussed in a techtimes summary of some journalists findings during the november   trials speedtest rated it at  mbps downloads a millisecond ping and uploads of  mbps on my first try said timothy j seppala from engadget he added that one drawback is the ping time which varies between  and  milliseconds  the verges chris welch meanwhile observed that upload speeds were almost nonexistent but stressed that casual internet users seldom need to upload anything larger than a picture or a vine video anyway as for streaming it works brilliantly when used by only  people total bandwidth on the media flight was capped at  mbps a gogo press release in september  stated that a japan airlines member jta was then the most recent company to order ku connectivity for its  aircraft more recently in a november

aircraft on november   gogo announced gogo text  talk an app that provides inflight cell phone calls and text messaging the product is to be officially launched on commercial jets in  surveillance supportedit in april  it was revealed through a us federal communications commission letter that gogo partnered with government officials to voluntarily develop capabilities to share user data with law enforcement beyond what is required under the federal communications assistance for law enforcement act in  adrienne porter felt a google security engineer discovered during flight on a gogo internetequipped plane that gogo uses fake ssl authentication carrying out a maninthemiddle attack on their users to capture user activity this deliberately fake authentication may be to enable law enforcement monitoring and also data mining of secure communications and criticized the company for its use the company was also criticized by symantec for this issue gogo has a legitimate interest in limiting or blocking video streaming but the way they’ve done it is far overreaching it is not known how long gogo continued the strategy but as a news site for the information security community indicated the issuing of fake ssl certificates has other risks for the user a cyber criminal “acting” as gogo could have performed many tasks without you ever realizing such as blocking or censoring websites capturing plain or encrypted data installing malware or even stealing passwords criticism of business modeledit it has been observed that gogo practices a roach motel type business model that makes it easy to sign up for service via automated means but requires interaction with a customer service representative to effect an immediate cancellation however service for next and future months may be cancelled via email by making it easy to begin paying for service but requiring a recurring monthly subscription even when a shorter term of service may be desired gogo makes it likely for infrequent flyers to be billed in subsequent months for a service they do not intend to use in addition gogo does not send monthly statements so customers are not alerted to the recurring charges the service does offer hour and hour passes that do not incur a recurring charge however this does not change the fact that even those limitedtime services are significantly harder to stop than to initiate gogo claims that to cancel service is as easy as signing up for it and directs subscribers to engage in online chat send email or call via telephone in contrast however the signup process does not require human interaction as of june   gogo provided an online selfservice cancellation option to cancel via my accountcitation needed classaction lawsuitedit in  gogo was the subject of a classaction lawsuit for allegedly not mentioning recurring charges on their website nor notifying customers that these recurring charges would be made a new york federal judge jack weinstein ruled on april   that the suit berkson et al v gogo llc case no cv in the us district court for the eastern district of new york for claims that the company tricked consumers into signing up for automatic monthly renewal of wifi connections was allowed to move forward in an page memorandum and order of the case the judge wrote the average internet user would not have been informed   that he was binding himself to a signinwrap and that the wrap contract thus does not support the venue and arbitration clauses relied upon by defendants see alsoedit boingo wireless connexion by boeing onair panasonic

locations using the  mhz atg band unlike terrestrial cell sites atg ground stations project a directional signal up into the air where airplanes are rather than downward where terrestrial users are however the short wavelength used allows segmentation and other cellular technologies in the same way that terrestrial cellphone technology works the aircraft communicates with the ground stations through an antenna installed on the underbelly of the fuselage equipment in the aircrafts avionics bay converts between proprietary gogo protocols and standard wifi which is distributed into the passenger cabin through multiple interior wireless access point nodes atgedit gogos atg system is a backwards compatible improvement to the previous atg system maximum total download bandwidth has increased from  mbits to  mbits atg has been installed on at least  aircraft gogo can upgrade planes from atg to atg overnight atg is powered by evdo rev b one of the only production applications of

gogo claims that the service can provide speeds up to  megabits per second with mbits to be available when satellitebeaming techniques are perfected actual speed is less impressive as discussed in a techtimes summary of some journalists findings during the november   trials speedtest rated it at  mbps downloads a millisecond ping and uploads of  mbps on my first try said timothy j seppala from engadget he added that one drawback is the ping time which varies between  and  milliseconds  the verges chris welch meanwhile observed that upload speeds were almost nonexistent but stressed that casual internet users seldom need to upload anything larger than a picture or a vine video anyway as for streaming it works brilliantly when used by only  people total bandwidth on the media flight

aircraft on november   gogo announced gogo text  talk an app that provides inflight cell phone calls and text messaging the product is to be officially launched on commercial jets in  surveillance supportedit in april  it was revealed through a us federal communications commission letter that gogo partnered with government officials to voluntarily develop capabilities to share user data with law enforcement beyond what is required under the federal communications assistance for law enforcement act in  adrienne porter felt a google security engineer discovered during flight on a gogo internetequipped plane that gogo uses fake ssl authentication carrying out a maninthemiddle attack on their users to capture user activity this deliberately fake authentication may be to enable law enforcement monitoring and also data mining of secure communications and criticized the company for its use the company was also criticized by symantec for this issue gogo has a legitimate interest in limiting or blocking video streaming but the way they’ve done it is far overreaching it is not known how long gogo continued the strategy but as a news site for the information security community indicated the issuing of fake ssl certificates has other risks for the user a cyber criminal “acting” as gogo could have performed many tasks without you ever realizing such as blocking or censoring websites capturing plain or encrypted data installing malware or even stealing passwords criticism of business modeledit it has been observed that gogo practices a roach motel type business model that makes it easy to sign up for service via automated means but requires interaction with a customer service representative to effect an immediate cancellation however service for next and future months may be cancelled via email by making it easy to begin paying for service but requiring a recurring monthly subscription even when a shorter term of service may be desired gogo makes it likely for infrequent flyers to be billed in subsequent months for a service they do not intend to use in addition gogo does not send monthly statements so customers are not alerted to the recurring charges the service does offer hour and hour passes that do not incur a recurring charge however this does not change the fact that even those limitedtime services are significantly harder to stop than to initiate gogo claims that to cancel service is as easy as signing up for it and directs subscribers to engage in online chat send email or call via telephone in contrast however the signup process does not require human interaction as of june   gogo provided an online selfservice cancellation option to cancel via my accountcitation needed classaction lawsuitedit in  gogo was the subject of a classaction lawsuit for allegedly not mentioning recurring charges on their website nor notifying customers that these recurring charges would be made a new york federal judge jack weinstein ruled on april   that the suit berkson et al v gogo llc case no cv in the us district court for the eastern district of new york for claims that the company tricked consumers into signing up for automatic monthly renewal of wifi connections was allowed to move forward in an page memorandum and order of the case the judge wrote the average internet user would not have been informed   that he was binding himself to a signinwrap and that the wrap contract thus does not support the venue and arbitration clauses relied upon by defendants see alsoedit boingo wireless connexion by boeing onair panasonic
