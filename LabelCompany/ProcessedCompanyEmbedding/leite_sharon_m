leaders a visit with sharon leite president of sally beauty us and canada by sharon leite mar   women leaders series an interview with sharon m leite president sally beauty sally beauty holdings inc  sharon let’s start at the beginning  where were you born i was born in madison wisconsin however i only lived there for two weeks my dad was a graduate of the naval academy and we were stationed there however two weeks after i was born we moved to great falls montana do you have any siblings i have two siblings both are younger than i am my brother michael lives in boston massachusetts and my brother eric lives in tampa florida what was your childhood like growing up after my dad’s time in the military my parents moved us back to their hometown of cleveland ohio we lived in the suburbs of cleveland until i was a freshman in high school during my freshman year of high school we moved to new orleans louisiana as i look back on my childhood i was very fortunate to have parents that supported anything i aspired to do or to be as well as a home filled with lots of love friends and family where did you go to college i attended three colleges loyola university kent state and delgado college  post college i am a lifelong learner i am involved in several trade organizations universities and enjoy reading tell us how you chose your career path in retail i stumbled into retail believe it or not by answering an ad in the newspaper that should give you an idea about how old i am 🙂 it was an ad to be an assistant manager in a women’s clothing store i thought it would be fun and it was i was hooked i loved helping the customer by helping her with an outfit for a special moment in her life and just helping to make her feel good  i also enjoyed being a shopkeeper presenting the merchandise in the windows in the store creating outfits it was my creative outlet during that time i also fell in love with leading people and developing teams sally beauty is north america’s largest specialty retailer of professional beauty products   as the new president of the us and canadian markets what are your first priorities for the brand my first priority at sally beauty was to define who we are in the marketplace  we have over  stores in the united states and canada from my view we are a specialty retailer however my team at sally beauty had never really thought of themselves in that way how you go to market as a specialty retailer is different than being a mass merchant  in tandem with that we had to define our brand story – we have a rich history at sally beauty we’ve been around for over  years however the organization had never thought of themselves as a brand so we defined our brand story   however to define that brand story we needed to know who our customer was  who is she why does she shop with us  what does she buy from us all of these things and many more had to be determined through research and customer data  and of course whenever you work in an organization getting to know the people and understanding the culture of the organization is a top priority who is the sally beauty customer our customer is a resourceful beauty enthusiast she is someone who loves the beauty category she’s a trend seeker a do it yourself diva and loves to experiment  many of our customers shop in what we call mass merchandising stores like cvs walgreens walmart and target  our brand positioning is a trade up from mass our customer is a woman who works hard she’s raising a family often by herself or she’s taking care of others many of our customers have multiple jobs my desire for us at sally beauty is to empower her to find her beautiful however and whatever that means to her in other words how she defines her beautiful how is today’s consumer different from say ten years ago the customer today has a lot more information at their fingertips  the movement to omni channel and the ability for the customer to shop when where and how she wants has definitely changed the retail landscape no longer does she need to go to a “store” to get what she wants she can shop from the convenience of her mobile device and most customers today start their shopping journey there in addition due to the many shipping options available she can often get what she wants without leaving her home and in some locations literally get something delivered to her in less than two hours  with the explosion of online retail sales what is your strategy in terms of balancing your market efforts online with your brick and mortar stores as we think about the future for sally beauty to be able to compete in an integrated commerce world we have to shift our strategy and invest in digital and the online experience we are in the process of putting together an extensive roadmap that allows us to play in this very important space part of the strategy is also developing key partnerships to aid us on this journey  for us playing local with all of our stores is also an important part of our strategy what are critical elements in developing and sustaining an iconic brand to be a great brand your customer has to know what you stand for first of all are you passionate about customers   what products do you offer that are unique and special  how do you differentiate yourself in the marketplace  do you deliver your brand consistently across all customer touch points  do you have brand ambassadors in your organization that can deliver on your brand promise these would be my top characteristics of a great brand what is sally beauty’s differentiator from its’ competition sally differentiates its place in the market by developing and delivering pro quality products at a value and providing advice and solutions to help her feel beautiful however she defines it  and with everything we do we back it up with a love it or return it guarantee we believe that beauty is for everyone especially you what is the best piece of professional advice you have received the best piece of professional advice i’ve ever received came from my dad  my parents have incredibly strong work ethics i remember sitting at the kitchen table and having a conversation with him when i was in middle school…we were talking about how hard he worked and how he had continued to find success in his professional life and i remember him telling me like it was yesterday that “you have to work hard in life to get what you want in this life sharon and if you don’t give it your all then just don’t bother” in my life especially in my professional life i’ve always tried to heed that advice who are some professional heroes i have several professional heroes the first two that come to mind are cynthia harriss and cynthia peter who i worked for at the walt disney company and alex smith who i worked for at pier  imports  these  leaders were exceptional teachers  i learned not only the skills to be more effective in my job but they were instrumental in shaping “how” i do my job  many of the leadership skills i have today i learned from them  two other professional heroes i learned so much from was les wexner ceo of l brands and mickey drexler who was the ceo of gap inc both men are legendary merchants when it comes to knowing what the customer wants  they’ve been innovators and taken appropriate risks to help make the businesses they lead successful i learned much from both of these leaders while working for the companies they lead or led personal heroes personal heroes are definitely my parents i can’t think of two people better to look up to and to model my life after they are two absolutely amazing people you have held csuite positions for many years now  what do you attribute your business success to i attribute the business success i’ve had in my career to the talent in the organization  you can’t be successful without the “right” people  not to mention having the right team makes the work environment so much more enjoyable  it makes getting through the tough times easier and the celebratory times that much sweeter  in my view it all starts with the people what is the part about your job you love the most the part of the job that i love the most is seeing people succeed and teams win there’s nothing more rewarding than seeing someone get promoted or someone accomplish a milestone  i love seeing people andor teams succeed at something they may have thought wasn’t possible can you leave us with your favorite quote i have several “a leader is one who knows the way goes the way and shows the way” john c maxwell “be a yardstick of quality  some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected” steve jobs “leadership and learning are indispensable to each other” john f kennedy “there are two kinds of people those who do the work and those who take the credit  try to the first group there is competition there” indira gandhi “good is the enemy of great” jim collins “i’ve learned that people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel” maya angelou thank you sharon for spending time with us   listen to sara webb’s interview with sharon
