quickly ran through its initial two million dollars in funding and in  the company ran out of money founder tim westergren convinced the fifty employees of the company to work for two years without pay initially the company pursued a transitional strategy of technology licensing to third parties including aol best buy barnes  noble and tower records in  the company returned to its initial vision of producing customized radio stations and changed its name to pandora media the website began as only a paid service but quickly changed to an advertising service to make it also available free for

streamingedit a station is set by specifying an artist or song or a combination of multiple items of any kind in a single station listeners can tune into premade genre stations other users stations or create their own stations based on their musical interests each track played can be responded to with favorable thumbs up or unfavorable thumbs down buttons which determine if it should be played and how much should similarly classified songs be played in the station a second negative response to the same artist will ban that artist from the selected station unless the user has marked the artist positively on another occasion or if that artist is listed under the stations variety no response is applicable to musical attributes or to albums an unfavorable response immediately stops play of the track clicking the thumbs down or skipping to the next song too many times in a row will result in a short ban of skips pandora also utilizes short advertisements in between every couple of songs in addition a menu is provided with the choices im tired of this song allowing users to remove a song from the station temporarily although it counts as a skip why was this song selected allowing users to learn more about the composition of each song move song to another station new station and bookmark a buy button is located at the top of each song block as well from there listeners can click on links to buy the song from itunes or amazon there is a setting in each members account regarding whether the user wants songs with explicit lyrics played this however applies exclusively to song versions from albums with the parental advisory label as other songs with censored versions will have that version played an example is jet airliner by the steve miller band which had one word censored for radio play with explicit lyrics off that version will play because the album did not have a pa label while listening users are offered the ability to buy the songs or albums at various online retailers over  different musical attributes are considered when selecting the next song these  attributes are combined into larger groups called focus traits there are  focus traits examples of these are rhythm syncopation key tonality vocal harmonies and displayed instrumental proficiency the service has two subscription plans a free subscription supported by advertisements and a  usdyear or  usdmonth subscription without ads there are also ads in pandora mobile for mobile phones and the pandora in the home computer appliance as of october  less than  of active listeners were

streaming offline playback support using a prediction mechanism and more skips and replays adsupported free users could also begin to receive more skips and replays in exchange for watching an advertisement pandora also intended to launch a premium service by the end of the year that would offer a full ondemand service more in line with competitors such as apple music and spotify on march   pandora launched pandora premium a new service priced at us which allows users to listen to and create playlists of individual songs ondemand pandoras suggestions engine is leveraged to suggest and recommend songs and albums as well as generate playlists based on similar songs pandora also emphasized a use of machine learning and manual curation and that it had filtered karaoke tracks knockoff covers and pet sounds but not pet sounds that slow down other other services from its library limitationsedit global availability of pandora to comply with the requirements and protections offered by the dmca pandora serves users only in the united states new zealand and australia initially this was enforced lightly by requiring a us zip code at registration but since may   pandora has used ip addresses to block users from noncomplying countries rewind is not permitted until may  six skips per station were allowed per hour further limited to  skips every  hours giving a thumbs down response or a dont play for a month response count as skips on may   the skip limit was altered such that it counts total skips from all stations with the limitation of twelve total skips every  hours if a listener gives a song a thumbsdown or dont play for a month after the limit has been exceeded the song will continue to play it is only after the song has completed that it becomes subject to the listeners restrictions play of a single artist is limited as pandora provides similar music not a playondemand service free accounts include advertising these include simple interruptions with the ad listed on the stream advertising skins which do not interrupt the stream and popup ads initially users with free accounts could listen to  hours of music a month and could pay  per month for unlimited streaming in september  pandora removed the  hour listening limit this  hour limit on free listening was reintroduced in march  for mobile devices however this limit was removed once more on september of the same year mobile devicesedit pandora ios app pandora is available on ios devices it is adsupported and retains the original skip limits pandora is also available on android for tablets and mobile phones and blackberry  handsets via the amazon app store the windows mobile client is limited to a select number of handsets however the installer is available from rd party sources and works fine or with only minor display glitches on most devices in march  it became available on windows phone  as a free app with adfree streaming until  the pandora for blackberry os  and earlier

also available to build from source soundspectrums iosbased visualizing application tunr has native support for pandora but requires a one subscription with a subscription to pandoras one service windows and mac users can download a desktop application for pandora that uses the adobe air without using a web browser to access pandora all the normal functionality is included such as thumbs updown skip pause and access to all channels on a users account business modeledit pandora decided to be a consumeroriented music discovery service specifically a noninteractive radio station in the three months that ended october   advertising comprised  of pandoras total revenues a figure of  was reported for this metric in december  rpm revenue per s of hours is determined based on cpms cost per thousand impressions cpms are largely dependent upon network effects and thus increase as a website scales and adds users as such pandoras strategy in order to allow for widespread distribution was to offer a service unbundled from devices and transport pandora is currently working with systemonchip manufacturers to embed its technologies on the chips they sell to consumer electronics manufacturers like samsung sony and panasonic pandoras cost structure is highly variable with content acquisition costs representing roughly  of total costs there are three main costs associated with content acquisition first soundexchange collects content fees on behalf of labels or artists on the recording themselves these are by far the largest content acquisition costscitation needed second pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as bmi ascap or sesac in order to compensate composers songwriters and publishers lastly pandora also pays rovi for song and artist information this has recently been structured as a flat monthly fee high variable costs mean that pandora does not have significant operating leverage and in the next couple years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly oneninth the rate of desktop hours since pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the users platform the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours mobile revenues will improve over time as pandora shifts from relying on thirdparty ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at premium rates in january  pandora met with investment banks to consider a possible  million ipo the company filed with the sec for a mm ipo on february   and officially began trading on the new york stock exchange with ticker symbol p on june   at a price of share this gave them a valuation of nearly  billion pandora announced  million in total revenue for their first quarter of fiscal  which was up  over their previous year q results of the  million  million came from advertising while the other  million came from subscription in addition pandora has seen a  advertising revenue increase and a  subscription revenue increase yearoveryear however the vast majority of pandoras users remain on the free adsupported model royaltiesedit in  a federal panel agreed with a soundexchange request and ordered a doubling of the persong performance royalty that web radio stations pay to performers and record companies under this scheme internet radio would pay double the royalty paid by satellite radio because of the passage of dmca in  that increased fees and asked for licensing guarantees the pandora service is no longer available in countries other than australia new zealand and the united states these rulings affect all usbased internetbased radio stations terrestrial radio is not affected as of july  pandora was in talks with major music labels regarding royalty issues to allow a return to the european market costs remain a concern because of european royalty standards and a low demand for paid music services in  the founder of pandora stated that the company may be on the verge of collapse royalty fees account for a majority portion of pandoras revenues if an agreement between pandora and soundexchange had not been reached it could have meant the end of pandora were losing money as it is said tim westergren the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money on september   a bill was passed by the us house and senate to allow sites like pandora to continue negotiations with soundexchange into  on july   pandora announced that an agreement had been reached regarding the royalty issue which would significantly reduce the royalty rate making it possible for pandora to stay in business also announced was that free listening would be limited to  hours per month but can be extended to unlimited for that month for usd the revised royalties are quite high the companys blog notes higher in fact than any other form of radio the extended listening fee differs from upgrading which also disables advertisements increases the bitrate from  to  kbps and provides a dedicated music player as opposed to listening through browser this service known as pandora one costs  and is billed annually pandora has since introduced an option to purchase pandora one subscriptions on a monthly basis at a rate of  per month also in september  pandora began working with hitbliss to make pandora one subscriptions available for hitbliss earnedpayment with an update to the pandora player in september  the  hour cap was extended to  hours on november   pandora reported its q earnings royalty costs accounted for  of revenue slightly better than expected its revenue most of it from advertising continues to rise at respectable rates not only has pandora attracted more users but the average number of hours per user have also increased pandora now accounts for an estimated  of total us listening hours as pandora grows it hopes to gain leverage on music labels and drive royalty costs down on december   the ceo of spotify daniel ek announced spotify radio would offer an unlimited number of stations and unlimited skips though pandoras usage is  mobile the spotify radio app competes against pandoras mobile market pandora ceo tim westergren has supported the internet radio fairness act or irfa hr s  which would reduce the companys royalty payments to the performers by  percent on november   pandora filed suit in federal district court against ascap over royalty fees in the suit the company sought to advocate for lower licensing fees on all the songs represented by the ascaps  members on february   pandora announced a hourpermonth limit on free mobile listening pandora ceo tim westergren cited escalating royalty costs as the reason for the mobile cap in a ruling made public earlier this year us district judge denise cote ruled that pandoras rate paid to ascap should remain the same— she cited p  troubling coordination between two of the biggest publishing companies sony and umpg and ascap that alludes to core antitrust concern in the industry after arguing that both ascap and bmi were showing bias towards international broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations pandora announced on june   that it would attempt to acquire kxmz a radio station in south dakota under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iheartradio which is owned by iheartmedia inc itself americas largest radio broadcaster the move was criticized by david israelite ceo of the national music publishers association who declared that pandora was now at war with songwriters and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to lawsuits and gimmicks to make its point however a member of public knowledge praised the move by stating that it was a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we get from a music licensing system that is based on who wants a license instead of just what they want to do with the music they’re using ascap also objected to the deal filing a petition to deny with the fcc the organization argued that the acquisition was not in the public interest because of pandoras intent to use it as a bargaining chip for royalty payments ascap also alleged that pandora did not provide enough information about its ownership structure failing to prove that less than  of the company was owned by foreign interests on january   the fcc denied the acquisition until pandora demonstrates adequate support for its foreign ownership compliance certification on september   pandora removed the hourpermonth limit on free mobile listening originally announced on february   pandora stated that it was able to make this change thanks to the rapid progress of its mobile advertising in  pandora signed an agreement with some music copyright owners for lower royalties in exchange for more frequent streaming of songs though not illegal this practice raised comparisons to payola which is illegal payment for airplay on terrestrial radio on september   pandora released pandora plus a new subscription service to compete with other streaming services the price was set at  and was available in later months receptionedit in may  pandora was named in leads  hottest san francisco companies list in  entertainment weekly compared a number of music services and granted pandora a b writing free streaming radio  a year to go adfree launched in  pandora is available on just about every platform theres no ondemand though and stations tend to draw from a relatively small pool of albums as of march  the annual option was eliminated and the us monthly plan was the only way to get pandora one the price rose to us a month in july  the annual subscription was brought back and is now us a year advertisingedit before pandora introduced advertising it initially offered a subscriptiononly service without commercials however the idea of paying did not sit well with most us consumers and the company had to consider alternative business models to offer a free service then in december  pandora sold its first advertisement in  pandora began playing more advertisements per hour in certain geographies and demographics pandora normally plays no more than  advertisements per hour for free users revenueedit pandora became fairly popular within just two years starting from  to  pandoras registered users had increased from  million to  million the companys revenue increased from  million to  million in which a majority of it from advertising in order to appeal to a large audience of consumers pandora offers adfree access for  a year during its  fiscal year pandora reported  million in revenue with a  million net loss excluding the cost of a special dividend associated with the ipo overall pandora controls  percent of internet radio and it has a  percent share of the us public radio finally in  industrywide total radio ad revenue increased to  billion in the us pitch to advertisersedit pandora obtains its advertisers by explaining that the company reaches a narrower audience compared to terrestrial radio pandoras pitch to advertisers is that its technology can cater to consumers with far greater precision than radio – it can pinpoint listeners by age and sex zip code or even musical taste methods of advertisingedit there are a few different methods of advertising on pandora audio advertising comes in spots of  to  seconds and run once every  minutes however users only encounter ads if they are engaging with the site like contributing a thumbs up or a thumbs down when changing a song or station next there are banner ads which are featured on the wallpaper of the site as noted by the new york times banner ads are on pandora in order to promote engagement audio segments can be accompanied by clickable display ads offering coupons or product information advertising on pandora works through a method of collecting data from the users online browsing activity once the data is collected the company uses the data to show the user target ads this process of advertising is also known as behavioral advertising pandora offers its users the option of submitting out of the targeted ads by a optout configuration on its website optingout will only prevent targeted ads meaning users may continue to see generic nontargeted ads from these companies after they optout eventually pandora offers either targeted advertisements or generic advertisements for its nonsubscribed users however pandoras advertising does not offer local content such as the local news weather traffic and talk market segmentsedit pandora has created two market segments one for spanish listeners and another for english listeners by creating multiple market segments pandoras advertising is customized to its users needs in order to create the first two market segments the company crossreferenced its registered user data with us census then the cross reference allows the company to identify zip codes with high populations of hispanic and spanishspeaking people and finally it ran tests overlaying the two data sets to infer which listeners fit into those buckets internet radio competitorsedit starting in the early s new entrants entered the personalized radio market such as grooveshark launched  iheartradio launched  mogcom tunein founded  accuradio rhapsody launched  and europes spotify all threatening to use the concept of true ondemand access to online music as a challenge to pandoras personalized radio europes most popular online streaming music service spotify launched in  and arrived in the us in mid as of  spotify has a catalogue of over  million songs compared to pandoras library of around  –  million as pointed out by editors miranda ferrara and michele lameau spotify allows users to upload their own songs to the online library while pandora allows listeners to connect to the social media site facebook to see what their friends are listening to spotify users can quickly and easily share playlists with their friends through facebook twitter email and sms text messages the second competitor that is targeting pandoras personalized radio appeal is iheartradio editors miranda ferrara and michele lameau note iheartradio is the largest radio operator in the united states with  million listeners and  stations in  markets iheartradio like pandora offers listeners the opportunity to like or dislike a song in order to receive recommendations on other tunes it also offers custom tools that allow the listener to discover new artists or more songs based on existing choices sirius xm has also become a competitor in recent years due to onlineonly accounts and being able to customize stations their wide availability in both the new and used car market also gives it an advantage over pandora when acquiring xm satellite radio in  sirius actually accurately predicted that it would be competing against streaming services like pandora in its argument with the federal communications commission fcc over whether the merging of the only two satellite radio companies in north america would cause antitrust issues as recognized by the ad age staff pandora has about  million monthly users and about a  share of the internet radio market in the us ad age predicted that competition would likely intensify due to apples acquisition of the beats music service but apple announced that it would be closing the service on november   yet even with all of its competition pandoras promoted stations rely on its core music genome project overall the music genome project of more than  attributes assigned to each song with a humancurated database of recorded music gives a big edge over competitors like spotify and beats music owned and operated

publishers featuresedit streamingedit a station is set by specifying an artist or song or a combination of multiple items of any kind in a single station listeners can tune into premade genre stations other users stations or create their own stations based on their musical interests each track played can be responded to with favorable thumbs up or unfavorable thumbs down buttons which determine if it should be played and how much should similarly classified songs be played in the station a second negative response to the same artist will ban that artist from the selected station unless the user has marked the artist positively on another occasion or if that artist is listed under the stations variety no response is applicable to musical attributes or to albums an unfavorable response immediately stops play of the track clicking the thumbs down or skipping to the next song too many times in a row will result in a short ban of skips pandora also utilizes short advertisements in between every couple of songs in addition a menu is provided with the choices im tired of this song allowing users to remove a song from the station temporarily although it counts as a skip why was this song selected allowing users to learn more about the composition of each song move song to another station new station and bookmark a buy button is located at the top of each song block as well from there listeners can click on links to buy the song from itunes or amazon there is a setting in each members account regarding whether the user wants songs with explicit lyrics played this however applies exclusively to song versions from albums with the parental advisory label as other songs with censored versions will have that version played an example is jet airliner by the steve miller band which had one word censored for radio play with explicit lyrics off that version will play because the album did not have a pa label while listening users are offered the ability to buy the songs or albums at various online retailers over  different musical attributes are considered when selecting the next song these  attributes are combined into larger groups called focus traits there are  focus traits examples of these are rhythm syncopation key tonality vocal harmonies and displayed instrumental proficiency the service has two subscription plans a free subscription supported by advertisements and a  usdyear or  usdmonth subscription without ads there are also ads in pandora mobile for mobile phones and the pandora in the home computer appliance as of october  less than  of

watching an advertisement pandora also intended to launch a premium service by the end of the year that would offer a full ondemand service more in line with competitors such as apple music and spotify on march   pandora launched pandora premium a new service priced at us which allows users to listen to and create playlists of individual songs ondemand pandoras suggestions engine is leveraged to suggest and recommend songs and albums as well as generate playlists based on similar songs pandora also emphasized a use of machine learning and manual curation and that it had filtered karaoke tracks knockoff covers and pet sounds but not pet sounds that slow down other other services from its library limitationsedit global availability of pandora to comply with the requirements and protections offered by the dmca pandora serves users only in the united states new zealand and australia initially this was enforced lightly by requiring a us zip code at registration but since may   pandora has used ip addresses to block users from noncomplying countries rewind is not permitted until may  six skips per station were allowed per hour further limited to  skips every  hours giving a thumbs down response or a dont play for a month response count as skips on may   the skip limit was altered such that it counts total skips from all stations with the limitation of twelve total skips every  hours if a listener gives a song a thumbsdown or dont play for a month after the limit has been exceeded the song will continue to play it is only after the song has completed that it becomes subject to the listeners restrictions play of a single artist is limited as pandora provides similar music not a playondemand service free accounts include advertising these include simple interruptions with the ad listed on the stream advertising skins which do not interrupt the stream and popup ads initially users with free accounts could listen to  hours of music a month and could pay  per month for unlimited streaming in september  pandora removed the  hour listening limit this  hour limit on free listening was reintroduced in march  for mobile devices however this limit was removed once more on september of the same year mobile devicesedit pandora ios app pandora is available on ios devices it is adsupported and retains the original skip limits pandora is also available

pandoras one service windows and mac users can download a desktop application for pandora that uses the adobe air without using a web browser to access pandora all the normal functionality is included such as thumbs updown skip pause and access to all channels on a users account business modeledit pandora decided to be a consumeroriented music discovery service specifically a noninteractive radio station in the three months that ended october   advertising comprised  of pandoras total revenues a figure of  was reported for this metric in december  rpm revenue per s of hours is determined based on cpms cost per thousand impressions cpms are largely dependent upon network effects and thus increase as a website scales and adds users as such pandoras strategy in order to allow for widespread distribution was to offer a service unbundled from devices and transport pandora is currently working with systemonchip manufacturers to embed its technologies on the chips they sell to consumer electronics manufacturers like samsung sony and panasonic pandoras cost structure is highly variable with content acquisition costs representing roughly  of total costs there are three main costs associated with content acquisition first soundexchange collects content fees on behalf of labels or artists on the recording themselves these are by far the largest content acquisition costscitation needed second pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as bmi ascap or sesac in order to compensate composers songwriters and publishers lastly pandora also pays rovi for song and artist information this has recently been structured as a flat monthly fee high variable costs mean that pandora does not have significant operating leverage and in the next couple years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly oneninth the rate of desktop hours since pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the users platform the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours mobile revenues will improve over time as pandora shifts from relying on thirdparty ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at premium rates in january  pandora met with investment banks to consider a possible  million ipo the company filed with the sec for a mm ipo on february   and officially began trading on the new york stock exchange with ticker symbol p on june   at a price of share this gave them a valuation of nearly  billion pandora announced  million in total revenue for their first quarter of fiscal  which was up  over their previous year q results of the  million  million came from advertising while the other  million came from subscription in addition pandora has seen a  advertising revenue increase and a  subscription revenue increase yearoveryear however the vast majority of pandoras users remain on the free adsupported model royaltiesedit in  a federal panel agreed with a soundexchange request and ordered a doubling of the persong performance royalty that web radio stations pay to performers and record companies under this scheme internet radio would pay double the royalty paid by satellite radio because of the passage of dmca in  that increased fees and asked for licensing guarantees the pandora service is no longer available in countries other than australia new zealand and the united states these rulings affect all usbased internetbased radio stations terrestrial radio is not affected as of july  pandora was in talks with major music labels regarding royalty issues to allow a return to the european market costs remain a concern because of european royalty standards and a low demand for paid music services in  the founder of pandora stated that the company may be on the verge of collapse royalty fees account for a majority portion of pandoras revenues if an agreement between pandora and soundexchange had not been reached it could have meant the end of pandora were losing money as it is said tim westergren the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money on september   a bill was passed by the us house and senate to allow sites like pandora to continue negotiations with soundexchange into  on july   pandora announced that an agreement had been reached regarding the royalty issue which would significantly reduce the royalty rate making it possible for pandora to stay in business also announced was that free listening would be limited to  hours per month but can be extended to unlimited for that month for usd the revised royalties are quite high the companys blog notes higher in fact than any other form of radio the extended listening fee differs from upgrading which also disables advertisements increases the bitrate from  to  kbps and provides a dedicated music player as opposed to listening through browser this service known as pandora one costs  and is billed annually pandora has since introduced an option to purchase pandora one subscriptions on a monthly basis at a rate of  per month also in september  pandora began working with hitbliss to make pandora one subscriptions available for hitbliss earnedpayment with an update to the pandora player in september  the  hour cap was extended to  hours on november   pandora reported its q earnings royalty costs accounted for  of revenue slightly better than expected its revenue most of it from advertising continues to rise at respectable rates not only has pandora attracted more users but the average number of hours per user have also increased pandora now accounts for an estimated  of total us listening hours as pandora grows it hopes to gain leverage on music labels and drive royalty costs down on december   the ceo of spotify daniel ek announced spotify radio would offer an unlimited number of stations and unlimited skips though pandoras usage is  mobile the spotify radio app competes against pandoras mobile market pandora ceo tim westergren has supported the internet radio fairness act or irfa hr s  which would reduce the companys royalty payments to the performers by  percent on november   pandora filed suit in federal district court against ascap over royalty fees in the suit the company sought to advocate for lower licensing fees on all the songs represented by the ascaps  members on february   pandora announced a hourpermonth limit on free mobile listening pandora ceo tim westergren cited escalating royalty costs as the reason for the mobile cap in a ruling made public earlier this year us district judge denise cote ruled that pandoras rate paid to ascap should remain the same— she cited p  troubling coordination between two of the biggest publishing companies sony and umpg and ascap that alludes to core antitrust concern in the industry after arguing that both ascap and bmi were showing bias towards international broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations pandora announced on june   that it would attempt to acquire kxmz a radio station in south dakota under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iheartradio which is owned by iheartmedia inc itself americas largest radio broadcaster the move was criticized by david israelite ceo of the national music publishers association who declared that pandora was now at war with songwriters and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to lawsuits and gimmicks to make its point however a member of public knowledge praised the move by stating that it was a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we get from a music licensing system that is based on who wants a license instead of just what they want to do with the music they’re using ascap also objected to the deal filing a petition to deny with the fcc the organization argued that the acquisition was not in the public interest because of pandoras intent to use it as a bargaining chip for royalty payments ascap also alleged that pandora did not provide enough information about its ownership structure failing to prove that less than  of the company was owned by foreign interests on january   the fcc denied the acquisition until pandora demonstrates adequate support for its foreign ownership compliance certification on september   pandora removed the hourpermonth limit on free mobile listening originally announced on february   pandora stated that it was able to make this change thanks to the rapid progress of its mobile advertising in  pandora signed an agreement with some music copyright owners for lower royalties in exchange for more frequent streaming of songs though not illegal this practice raised comparisons to payola which is illegal payment for airplay on terrestrial radio on september   pandora released pandora plus a new subscription service to compete with other streaming services the price was set at  and was available in later months receptionedit in may  pandora was named in leads  hottest san francisco companies list in  entertainment weekly compared a number of music services and granted pandora a b writing free streaming radio  a year to go adfree launched in  pandora is available on just about every platform theres no ondemand though and stations tend to draw from a relatively small pool of albums as of march  the annual option was eliminated and the us monthly plan was the only way to get pandora one the price rose to us a month in july  the annual subscription was brought back and is now us a year advertisingedit before pandora introduced advertising it initially offered a subscriptiononly service without commercials however the idea of paying did not sit well with most us consumers and the company had to consider alternative business models to offer a free service then in december  pandora sold its first advertisement in  pandora began playing more advertisements per hour in certain geographies and demographics pandora normally plays no more than  advertisements per hour for free users revenueedit pandora became fairly popular within just two years starting from  to  pandoras registered users had increased from  million to  million the companys revenue increased from  million to  million in which a majority of it from advertising in order to appeal to a large audience of consumers pandora offers adfree access for  a year during its  fiscal year pandora reported  million in revenue with a  million net loss excluding the cost of a special dividend associated with the ipo overall pandora controls  percent of internet radio and it has a  percent share of the us public radio finally in  industrywide total radio ad revenue increased to  billion in the us pitch to advertisersedit pandora obtains its advertisers by explaining that the company reaches a narrower audience compared to terrestrial radio pandoras pitch to advertisers is that its technology can cater to consumers with far greater precision than radio – it can pinpoint listeners by age and sex zip code or even musical taste methods of advertisingedit there are a few different methods of advertising on pandora audio advertising comes in spots of  to  seconds and run once every  minutes however users only encounter ads if they are engaging with the site like contributing a thumbs up or a thumbs down when changing a song or station next there are banner ads which are featured on the wallpaper of the site as noted by the new york times banner ads are on pandora in order to promote engagement audio segments can be accompanied by clickable display ads offering coupons or product information advertising on pandora works through a method of collecting data from the users online browsing activity once the data is collected the company uses the data to show the user target ads this process of advertising is also known as behavioral advertising pandora offers its users the option of submitting out of the targeted ads by a optout configuration on its website optingout will only prevent targeted ads meaning users may continue to see generic nontargeted ads from these companies after they optout eventually pandora offers either targeted advertisements or generic advertisements for its nonsubscribed users however pandoras advertising does not offer local content such as the local news weather traffic and talk market segmentsedit pandora has created two market segments one for spanish listeners and another for english listeners by creating multiple market segments pandoras advertising is customized to its users needs in order to create the first two market segments the company crossreferenced its registered user data with us census then the cross reference allows the company to identify zip codes with high populations of hispanic and spanishspeaking people and finally it ran tests overlaying the two data sets to infer which listeners fit into those buckets internet radio competitorsedit starting in the early s new entrants entered the personalized radio market such as grooveshark launched  iheartradio launched  mogcom tunein founded  accuradio rhapsody launched  and europes spotify all threatening to use the concept of true ondemand access to online music as a challenge to pandoras personalized radio europes most popular online streaming music service spotify launched in  and arrived in the us in mid as of  spotify has a catalogue of over  million songs compared to pandoras library of around  –  million as pointed out by editors miranda ferrara and michele lameau spotify allows users to upload their own songs to the online library while pandora allows listeners to connect to the social media site facebook to see what their friends are listening to spotify users can quickly and easily share playlists with their friends through facebook twitter email and sms text messages the second competitor that is targeting pandoras personalized radio appeal is iheartradio editors miranda ferrara and michele lameau note iheartradio is the largest radio operator in the united states with  million listeners and  stations in  markets iheartradio like pandora offers listeners the opportunity to like or dislike a song in order to receive recommendations on other tunes it also offers custom tools that allow the listener to discover new artists or more songs based on existing choices sirius xm has also become a competitor in recent years due to onlineonly accounts and being able to customize stations their wide availability in both the new and used car market also gives it an advantage over pandora when acquiring xm satellite radio in  sirius actually accurately predicted that it would be competing against streaming services like pandora in its argument with the federal communications commission fcc over whether the merging of the only two satellite radio companies in north america would cause antitrust issues as recognized by the ad age staff pandora has about  million monthly users and about a  share of the internet radio market in the us ad age predicted that competition would likely intensify due to apples acquisition of the beats music service but apple announced that it would be closing the service on november   yet even with all of its competition pandoras promoted stations rely on its core music genome project overall the music genome project of more than  attributes assigned to each song with a humancurated database of recorded music gives a big edge over competitors like spotify and

spotify on march   pandora launched pandora premium a new service priced at us which allows users to listen to and create playlists of individual songs ondemand pandoras suggestions engine is leveraged to suggest and recommend songs and albums as well as generate playlists based on similar songs pandora also emphasized a use of machine learning and manual curation and that it had filtered karaoke tracks knockoff covers and pet sounds but not pet sounds that slow down other other services from its library limitationsedit global availability of pandora to comply with the requirements and protections offered by the dmca pandora serves users only in the united states new zealand and australia initially this was enforced lightly by requiring a us zip code at registration but since may   pandora has used ip addresses to block users from noncomplying countries rewind is not permitted until may  six skips per station were allowed per hour further limited to  skips every  hours giving a thumbs down response or a dont play for a month response count as skips on may   the skip limit was altered such that it counts total skips from all stations with the limitation of twelve total skips every  hours if a listener gives a song a thumbsdown or dont play for a month after the limit has been exceeded the song will continue to play it is only after the song has completed that it becomes subject to the listeners restrictions play of a single artist is limited as pandora provides similar music not a playondemand service free accounts include advertising these include simple interruptions with the ad listed on the stream advertising skins which do not interrupt the stream and popup ads initially users with free accounts could listen to  hours of music a month and could pay  per month for unlimited streaming in september  pandora removed the  hour listening limit this  hour limit on free listening was reintroduced in march  for mobile devices however this limit was removed once more on september of the same year mobile devicesedit pandora ios app pandora is available on ios devices it is adsupported and retains the original skip limits pandora is also available on android for tablets and mobile phones and blackberry  handsets via the amazon app store the windows mobile client is limited to a select number of handsets however the installer is available from

pandoras one service windows and mac users can download a desktop application for pandora that uses the adobe air without using a web browser to access pandora all the normal functionality is included such as thumbs updown skip pause and access to all channels on a users account business modeledit pandora decided to be a consumeroriented music discovery service specifically a noninteractive radio station in the three months that ended october   advertising comprised  of pandoras total revenues a figure of  was reported for this metric in december  rpm revenue per s of hours is determined based on cpms cost per thousand impressions cpms are largely dependent upon network effects and thus increase as a website scales and adds users as such pandoras strategy in order to allow for widespread distribution was to offer a service unbundled from devices and transport pandora is currently working with systemonchip manufacturers to embed its technologies on the chips they sell to consumer electronics manufacturers like samsung sony and panasonic pandoras cost structure is highly variable with content acquisition costs representing roughly  of total costs there are three main costs associated with content acquisition first soundexchange collects content fees on behalf of labels or artists on the recording themselves these are by far the largest content acquisition costscitation needed second pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as bmi ascap or sesac in order to compensate composers songwriters and publishers lastly pandora also pays rovi for song and artist information this has recently been structured as a flat monthly fee high variable costs mean that pandora does not have significant operating leverage and in the next couple years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly oneninth the rate of desktop hours since pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the users platform the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours mobile revenues will improve over time as pandora shifts from relying on thirdparty ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at premium rates in january  pandora met with investment banks to consider a possible  million ipo the company filed with the sec for a mm ipo on february   and officially began trading on the new york stock exchange with ticker symbol p on june   at a price of share this gave them a valuation of nearly  billion pandora announced  million in total revenue for their first quarter of fiscal  which was up  over their previous year q results of the  million  million came from advertising while the other  million came from subscription in addition pandora has seen a  advertising revenue increase and a  subscription revenue increase yearoveryear however the vast majority of pandoras users remain on the free adsupported model royaltiesedit in  a federal panel agreed with a soundexchange request and ordered a doubling of the persong performance royalty that web radio stations pay to performers and record companies under this scheme internet radio would pay double the royalty paid by satellite radio because of the passage of dmca in  that increased fees and asked for licensing guarantees the pandora service is no longer available in countries other than australia new zealand and the united states these rulings affect all usbased internetbased radio stations terrestrial radio is not affected as of july  pandora was in talks with major music labels regarding royalty issues to allow a return to the european market costs remain a concern because of european royalty standards and a low demand for paid music services in  the founder of pandora stated that the company may be on the verge of collapse royalty fees account for a majority portion of pandoras revenues if an agreement between pandora and soundexchange had not been reached it could have meant the end of pandora were losing money as it is said tim westergren the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money on september   a bill was passed by the us house and senate to allow sites like pandora to continue negotiations with soundexchange into  on july   pandora announced that an agreement had been reached regarding the royalty issue which would significantly reduce the royalty rate making it possible for pandora to stay in business also announced was that free listening would be limited to  hours per month but can be extended to unlimited for that month for usd the revised royalties are quite high the companys blog notes higher in fact than any other form of radio the extended listening fee differs from upgrading which also disables advertisements increases the bitrate from  to  kbps and provides a dedicated music player as opposed to listening through browser this service known as pandora one costs  and is billed annually pandora has since introduced an option to purchase pandora one subscriptions on a monthly basis at a rate of  per month also in september  pandora began working with hitbliss to make pandora one subscriptions available for hitbliss earnedpayment with an update to the pandora player in september  the  hour cap was extended to  hours on november   pandora reported its q earnings royalty costs accounted for  of revenue slightly better than expected its revenue most of it from advertising continues to rise at respectable rates not only has pandora attracted more users but the average number of hours per user have also increased pandora now accounts for an estimated  of total us listening hours as pandora grows it hopes to gain leverage on music labels and drive royalty costs down on december   the ceo of spotify daniel ek announced spotify radio would offer an unlimited number of stations and unlimited skips though pandoras usage is  mobile the spotify radio app competes against pandoras mobile market pandora ceo tim westergren has supported the internet radio fairness act or irfa hr s  which would reduce the companys royalty payments to the performers by  percent on november   pandora filed suit in federal district court against ascap over royalty fees in the suit the company sought to advocate for lower licensing fees on all the songs represented by the ascaps  members on february   pandora announced a hourpermonth limit on free mobile listening pandora ceo tim westergren cited escalating royalty costs as the reason for the mobile cap in a ruling made public earlier this year us district judge denise cote ruled that pandoras rate paid to ascap should remain the same— she cited p  troubling coordination between two of the biggest publishing companies sony and umpg and ascap that alludes to core antitrust concern in the industry after arguing that both ascap and bmi were showing bias towards international broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations pandora announced on june   that it would attempt to acquire kxmz a radio station in south dakota under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iheartradio which is owned by iheartmedia inc itself americas largest radio broadcaster the move was criticized by david israelite ceo of the national music publishers association who declared that pandora was now at war with songwriters and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to lawsuits and gimmicks to make its point however a member of public knowledge praised the move by stating that it was a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we get from a music licensing system that is based on who wants a license instead of just what they want to do with the music they’re using ascap also objected to the deal filing a petition to deny with the fcc the organization argued that the acquisition was not in the public interest because of pandoras intent to use it as a bargaining chip for royalty payments ascap also alleged that pandora did not provide enough information about its ownership structure failing to prove that less than  of the company was owned by foreign interests on january   the fcc denied the acquisition until pandora demonstrates adequate support for its foreign ownership compliance certification on september   pandora removed the hourpermonth limit on free mobile listening originally announced on february   pandora stated that it was able to make this change thanks to the rapid progress of its mobile advertising in  pandora signed an agreement with some music copyright owners for lower royalties in exchange for more frequent streaming of songs though not illegal this practice raised comparisons to payola which is illegal payment for airplay on terrestrial radio on september   pandora released pandora plus a new subscription service to compete with other streaming services the price was set at  and was available in later months receptionedit in may  pandora was named in leads  hottest san francisco companies list in  entertainment weekly compared a number of music services and granted pandora a b writing free streaming radio  a year to go adfree launched in  pandora is available on just about every platform theres no ondemand though and stations tend to draw from a relatively small pool of albums as of march  the annual option was eliminated and the us monthly plan was the only way to get pandora one the price rose to us a month in july  the annual subscription was brought back and is now us a year advertisingedit before pandora introduced advertising it initially offered a subscriptiononly service without commercials however the idea of paying did not sit well with most us consumers and the company had to consider alternative business models to offer a free service then in december  pandora sold its first advertisement in  pandora began playing more advertisements per hour in certain geographies and demographics pandora normally plays no more than  advertisements per hour for free users revenueedit pandora became fairly popular within just two years starting from  to  pandoras registered users had increased from  million to  million the companys revenue increased from  million to  million in which a majority of it from advertising in order to appeal to a large audience of consumers pandora offers adfree access for  a year during its  fiscal year pandora reported  million in revenue with a  million net loss excluding the cost of a special dividend associated with the ipo overall pandora controls  percent of internet radio and it has a  percent share of the us public radio finally in  industrywide total radio ad revenue increased to  billion in the us pitch to advertisersedit pandora obtains its advertisers by explaining that the company reaches a narrower audience compared to terrestrial radio pandoras pitch to advertisers is that its technology can cater to consumers with far greater precision than radio – it can pinpoint listeners by age and sex zip code or even musical taste methods of advertisingedit there are a few different methods of advertising on pandora audio advertising comes in spots of  to  seconds and run once every  minutes however users only encounter ads if they are engaging with the site like contributing a thumbs up or a thumbs down when changing a song or station next there are banner ads which are featured on the wallpaper of the site as noted by the new york times banner ads are on pandora in order to promote engagement audio segments can be accompanied by clickable display ads offering coupons or product information advertising on pandora works through a method of collecting data from the users online browsing activity once the data is collected the company uses the data to show the user target ads this process of advertising is also known as behavioral advertising pandora offers its users the option of submitting out of the targeted ads by a optout configuration on its website optingout will only prevent targeted ads meaning users may continue to see generic nontargeted ads from these companies after they optout eventually pandora offers either targeted advertisements or generic advertisements for its nonsubscribed users however pandoras advertising does not offer local content such as the local news weather traffic and talk market segmentsedit pandora has created two market segments one for spanish listeners and another for english listeners by creating multiple market segments pandoras advertising is customized to its users needs in order to create the first two market segments the company crossreferenced its registered user data with us census then the cross reference allows the company to identify zip codes with high populations of hispanic and spanishspeaking people and finally it ran tests overlaying the two data sets to infer which listeners fit into those buckets internet radio competitorsedit starting in the early s new entrants entered the personalized radio market such as grooveshark launched  iheartradio launched  mogcom tunein founded  accuradio rhapsody launched  and europes spotify all threatening to use the concept of true ondemand access to online music as a challenge to pandoras personalized radio europes most popular online streaming music service spotify launched in  and arrived in the us in mid as of  spotify has a catalogue of over  million songs compared to pandoras library of around  –  million as pointed out by editors miranda ferrara and michele lameau spotify allows users to upload their own songs to the online library while pandora allows listeners to connect to the social media site facebook to see what their friends are listening to spotify users can quickly and easily share playlists with their friends through facebook twitter email and sms text messages the second competitor that is targeting pandoras personalized radio appeal is iheartradio editors miranda ferrara and michele lameau note iheartradio is the largest radio operator in the united states with  million listeners and  stations in  markets iheartradio like pandora offers listeners the opportunity to like or dislike a song in order to receive recommendations on other tunes it also offers custom tools that allow the listener to discover new artists or more songs based on existing choices sirius xm has also become a competitor in recent years due to onlineonly accounts and being able to customize stations their wide availability in both the new and used car market also gives it an advantage over pandora when acquiring xm satellite radio in  sirius actually accurately predicted that it would be competing against streaming services like pandora in its argument with the federal communications commission fcc over whether the merging of the only two satellite radio companies in north america would cause antitrust issues as recognized by the ad age staff pandora has about  million monthly users and about a  share of the internet radio market in the us ad age predicted that competition would likely intensify due to apples acquisition of the beats music service but apple announced that it would be closing the service on november   yet even with all of its competition pandoras promoted stations rely on its core music genome project overall the music genome project of more than  attributes assigned to each song with a humancurated database of recorded music gives a big edge over competitors like spotify and

pandoras one service windows and mac users can download a desktop application for pandora that uses the adobe air without using a web browser to access pandora all the normal functionality is included such as thumbs updown skip pause and access to all channels on a users account business modeledit pandora decided to be a consumeroriented music discovery service specifically a noninteractive radio station in the three months that ended october   advertising comprised  of pandoras total revenues a figure of  was reported for this metric in december  rpm revenue per s of hours is determined based on cpms cost per thousand impressions cpms are largely dependent upon network effects and thus increase as a website scales and adds users as such pandoras strategy in order to allow for widespread distribution was to offer a service unbundled from devices and transport pandora is currently working with systemonchip manufacturers to embed its technologies on the chips they sell to consumer electronics manufacturers like samsung sony and panasonic pandoras cost structure is highly variable with content acquisition costs representing roughly  of total costs there are three main costs associated with content acquisition first soundexchange collects content fees on behalf of labels or artists on the recording themselves these are by far the largest content acquisition costscitation needed second pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as bmi ascap or sesac in order to compensate composers songwriters and publishers lastly pandora also pays rovi for song and artist information this has recently been structured as a flat monthly fee high variable costs mean that pandora does not have significant operating leverage and in the next couple years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly oneninth the rate of desktop hours since pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the users platform the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours mobile revenues will improve over time as pandora shifts from relying on thirdparty ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at premium rates in january  pandora met with investment banks to consider a possible  million ipo the company filed with the sec for a mm ipo on february   and officially began trading on the new york stock exchange with ticker symbol p on june   at a price of share this gave them a valuation of nearly  billion pandora announced  million in total revenue for their first quarter of fiscal  which was up  over their previous year q results of the  million  million came from advertising while the other  million came from subscription in addition pandora has seen a  advertising revenue increase and a  subscription revenue increase yearoveryear however the vast majority of pandoras users remain on the free adsupported model royaltiesedit in  a federal panel agreed with a soundexchange request and ordered a doubling of the persong performance royalty that web radio stations pay to performers and record companies under this scheme internet radio would pay double the royalty paid by satellite radio because of the passage of dmca in  that increased fees and asked for licensing guarantees the pandora service is no longer available in countries other than australia new zealand and the united states these rulings affect all usbased internetbased radio stations terrestrial radio is not affected as of july  pandora was in talks with major music labels regarding royalty issues to allow a return to the european market costs remain a concern because of european royalty standards and a low demand for paid music services in  the founder of pandora stated that the company may be on the verge of collapse royalty fees account for a majority portion of pandoras revenues if an agreement between pandora and soundexchange had not been reached it could have meant the end of pandora were losing money as it is said tim westergren the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money on september   a bill was passed by the us house and senate to allow sites like pandora to continue negotiations with soundexchange into  on july   pandora announced that an agreement had been reached regarding the royalty issue which would significantly reduce the royalty rate making it possible for pandora to stay in business also announced was that free listening would be limited to  hours per month but can be extended to unlimited for that month for usd the revised royalties are quite high the companys blog notes higher in fact than any other form of radio the extended listening fee differs from upgrading which also disables advertisements increases the bitrate from  to  kbps and provides a dedicated music player as opposed to listening through browser this service known as pandora one costs  and is billed annually pandora has since introduced an option to purchase pandora one subscriptions on a monthly basis at a rate of  per month also in september  pandora began working with hitbliss to make pandora one subscriptions available for hitbliss earnedpayment with an update to the pandora player in september  the  hour cap was extended to  hours on november   pandora reported its q earnings royalty costs accounted for  of revenue slightly better than expected its revenue most of it from advertising continues to rise at respectable rates not only has pandora attracted more users but the average number of hours per user have also increased pandora now accounts for an estimated  of total us listening hours as pandora grows it hopes to gain leverage on music labels and drive royalty costs down on december   the ceo of spotify daniel ek announced spotify radio would offer an unlimited number of stations and unlimited skips though pandoras usage is  mobile the spotify radio app competes against pandoras mobile market pandora ceo tim westergren has supported the internet radio fairness act or irfa hr s  which would reduce the companys royalty payments to the performers by  percent on november   pandora filed suit in federal district court against ascap over royalty fees in the suit the company sought to advocate for lower licensing fees on all the songs represented by the ascaps  members on february   pandora announced a hourpermonth limit on free mobile listening pandora ceo tim westergren cited escalating royalty costs as the reason for the mobile cap in a ruling made public earlier this year us district judge denise cote ruled that pandoras rate paid to ascap should remain the same— she cited p  troubling coordination between two of the biggest publishing companies sony and umpg and ascap that alludes to core antitrust concern in the industry after arguing that both ascap and bmi were showing bias towards international broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations pandora announced on june   that it would attempt to acquire kxmz a radio station in south dakota under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iheartradio which is owned by iheartmedia inc itself americas largest radio broadcaster the move was criticized by david israelite ceo of the national music publishers association who declared that pandora was now at war with songwriters and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to lawsuits and gimmicks to make its point however a member of public knowledge praised the move by stating that it was a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we get from a music licensing system that is based on who wants a license instead of just what they want to do with the music they’re using ascap also objected to the deal filing a petition to deny with the fcc the organization argued that the acquisition was not in the public interest because of pandoras intent to use it as a bargaining chip for royalty payments ascap also alleged that pandora did not provide enough information about its ownership structure failing to prove that less than  of the company was owned by foreign interests on january   the fcc denied the acquisition until pandora demonstrates adequate support for its foreign ownership compliance certification on september   pandora removed the hourpermonth limit on free mobile listening originally announced on february   pandora stated that it was able to make this change thanks to the rapid progress of its mobile advertising in  pandora signed an agreement with some music copyright owners for lower royalties in exchange for more frequent streaming of songs though not illegal this practice raised comparisons to payola which is illegal payment for airplay on terrestrial radio on september   pandora released pandora plus a new subscription service to compete with other streaming services the price was set at  and was available in later months receptionedit in may  pandora was named in leads  hottest san francisco companies list in  entertainment weekly compared a number of music services and granted pandora a b writing free streaming radio  a year to go adfree launched in  pandora is available on just about every platform theres no ondemand though and stations tend to draw from a relatively small pool of albums as of march  the annual option was eliminated and the us monthly plan was the only way to get pandora one the price rose to us a month in july  the annual subscription was brought back and is now us a year advertisingedit before pandora introduced advertising it initially offered a subscriptiononly service without commercials however the idea of paying did not sit well with most us consumers and the company had to consider alternative business models to offer a free service then in december  pandora sold its first advertisement in  pandora began playing more advertisements per hour in certain geographies and demographics pandora normally plays no more than  advertisements per hour for free users revenueedit pandora became fairly popular within just two years starting from  to  pandoras registered users had increased from  million to  million the companys revenue increased from  million to  million in which a majority of it from advertising in order to appeal to a large audience of consumers pandora offers adfree access for  a year during its  fiscal year pandora reported  million in revenue with a  million net loss excluding the cost of a special dividend associated with the ipo overall pandora controls  percent of internet radio and it has a  percent share of the us public radio finally in  industrywide total radio ad revenue increased to  billion in the us pitch to advertisersedit pandora obtains its advertisers by explaining that the company reaches a narrower audience compared to terrestrial radio pandoras pitch to advertisers is that its technology can cater to consumers with far greater precision than radio – it can pinpoint listeners by age and sex zip code or even musical taste methods of advertisingedit there are a few different methods of advertising on pandora audio advertising comes in spots of  to  seconds and run once every  minutes however users only encounter ads if they are engaging with the site like contributing a thumbs up or a thumbs down when changing a song or station next there are banner ads which are featured on the wallpaper of the site as noted by the new york times banner ads are on pandora in order to promote engagement audio segments can be accompanied by clickable display ads offering coupons or product information advertising on pandora works through a method of collecting data from the users online browsing activity once the data is collected the company uses the data to show the user target ads this process of advertising is also known as behavioral advertising pandora offers its users the option of submitting out of the targeted ads by a optout configuration on its website optingout will only prevent targeted ads meaning users may continue to see generic nontargeted ads from these companies after they optout eventually pandora offers either targeted advertisements or generic advertisements for its nonsubscribed users however pandoras advertising does not offer local content such as the local news weather traffic and talk market segmentsedit pandora has created two market segments one for spanish listeners and another for english listeners by creating multiple market segments pandoras advertising is customized to its users needs in order to create the first two market segments the company crossreferenced its registered user data with us census then the cross reference allows the company to identify zip codes with high populations of hispanic and spanishspeaking people and finally it ran tests overlaying the two data sets to infer which listeners fit into those buckets internet radio competitorsedit starting in the early s new entrants entered the personalized radio market such as grooveshark launched  iheartradio launched  mogcom tunein founded  accuradio rhapsody launched  and europes spotify all threatening to use the concept of true ondemand access to online music as a challenge to pandoras personalized radio europes most popular online streaming music service spotify launched in  and arrived in the us in mid as of  spotify has a catalogue of over  million songs compared to pandoras library of around  –  million as pointed out by editors miranda ferrara and michele lameau spotify allows users to upload their own songs to the online library while pandora allows listeners to connect to the social media site facebook to see what their friends are listening to spotify users can quickly and easily share playlists with their friends through facebook twitter email and sms text messages the second competitor that is targeting pandoras personalized radio appeal is iheartradio editors miranda ferrara and michele lameau note iheartradio is the largest radio operator in the united states with  million listeners and  stations in  markets iheartradio like pandora offers listeners the opportunity to like or dislike a song in order to receive recommendations on other tunes it also offers custom tools that allow the listener to discover new artists or more songs based on existing choices sirius xm has also become a competitor in recent years due to onlineonly accounts and being able to customize stations their wide availability in both the new and used car market also gives it an advantage over pandora when acquiring xm satellite radio in  sirius actually accurately predicted that it would be competing against streaming services like pandora in its argument with the federal communications commission fcc over whether the merging of the only two satellite radio companies in north america would cause antitrust issues as recognized by the ad age staff pandora has about  million monthly users and about a  share of the internet radio market in the us ad age predicted that competition would likely intensify due to apples acquisition of the beats music service but apple announced that it would be closing the service on november   yet even with all of its competition pandoras promoted stations rely on its core music genome project overall the music genome project of more than  attributes assigned to each song with a humancurated database of recorded music gives a big edge over competitors like spotify and

has marked the artist positively on another occasion or if that artist is listed under the stations variety no response is applicable to musical attributes or to albums an unfavorable response immediately stops play of the track clicking the thumbs down or skipping to the next song too many times in a row will result in a short ban of skips pandora also utilizes short advertisements in

pandoras one service windows and mac users can download a desktop application for pandora that uses the adobe air without using a web browser to access pandora all the normal functionality is included such as thumbs updown skip pause and access to all channels on a users account business modeledit pandora decided to be a consumeroriented music discovery service specifically a noninteractive radio station in the three months that ended october   advertising comprised  of pandoras total revenues a figure of  was reported for this metric in december  rpm revenue per s of hours is determined based on cpms cost per thousand impressions cpms are largely dependent upon network effects and thus increase as a website scales and adds users as such pandoras strategy in order to allow for widespread distribution was to offer a service unbundled from devices and transport pandora is currently working with systemonchip manufacturers to embed its technologies on the chips they sell to consumer electronics manufacturers like samsung sony and panasonic pandoras cost structure is highly variable with content acquisition costs representing roughly  of total costs there are three main costs associated with content acquisition first soundexchange collects content fees on behalf of labels or artists on the recording themselves these are by far the largest content acquisition costscitation needed second pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as bmi ascap or sesac in order to compensate composers songwriters and publishers lastly pandora also pays rovi for song and artist information this has recently been structured as a flat monthly fee high variable costs mean that pandora does not have significant operating leverage and in the next couple years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly oneninth the rate of desktop hours since pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the users platform the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours mobile revenues will improve over time as pandora shifts from relying on thirdparty ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at premium rates in january  pandora met with investment banks to consider a possible  million ipo the company filed with the sec for a mm ipo on february   and officially began trading on the new york stock exchange with ticker symbol p on june   at a price of share this gave them a valuation of nearly  billion pandora announced  million in total revenue for their first quarter of fiscal  which was up  over their previous year q results of the  million  million came from advertising while the other  million came from subscription in addition pandora has seen a  advertising revenue increase and a  subscription revenue increase yearoveryear however the vast majority of pandoras users remain on the free adsupported model royaltiesedit in  a federal panel agreed with a soundexchange request and ordered a doubling of the persong performance royalty that web radio stations pay to performers and record companies under this scheme internet radio would pay double the royalty paid by satellite radio because of the passage of dmca in  that increased fees and asked for licensing guarantees the pandora service is no longer available in countries other than australia new zealand and the united states these rulings affect all usbased internetbased radio stations terrestrial radio is not affected as of july  pandora was in talks with major music labels regarding royalty issues to allow a return to the european market costs remain a concern because of european royalty standards and a low demand for paid music services in  the founder of pandora stated that the company may be on the verge of collapse royalty fees account for a majority portion of pandoras revenues if an agreement between pandora and soundexchange had not been reached it could have meant the end of pandora were losing money as it is said tim westergren the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money on september   a bill was passed by the us house and senate to allow sites like pandora to continue negotiations with soundexchange into  on july   pandora announced that an agreement had been reached regarding the royalty issue which would significantly reduce the royalty rate making it possible for pandora to stay in business also announced was that free listening would be limited to  hours per month but can be extended to unlimited for that month for usd the revised royalties are quite high the companys blog notes higher in fact than any other form of radio the extended listening fee differs from upgrading which also disables advertisements increases the bitrate from  to  kbps and provides a dedicated music player as opposed to listening through browser this service known as pandora one costs  and is billed annually pandora has since introduced an option to purchase pandora one subscriptions on a monthly basis at a rate of  per month also in september  pandora began working with hitbliss to make pandora one subscriptions available for hitbliss earnedpayment with an update to the pandora player in september  the  hour cap was extended to  hours on november   pandora reported its q earnings royalty costs accounted for  of revenue slightly better than expected its revenue most of it from advertising continues to rise at respectable rates not only has pandora attracted more users but the average number of hours per user have also increased pandora now accounts for an estimated  of total us listening hours as pandora grows it hopes to gain leverage on music labels and drive royalty costs down on december   the ceo of spotify daniel ek announced spotify radio would offer an unlimited number of stations and unlimited skips though pandoras usage is  mobile the spotify radio app competes against pandoras mobile market pandora ceo tim westergren has supported the internet radio fairness act or irfa hr s  which would reduce the companys royalty payments to the performers by  percent on november   pandora filed suit in federal district court against ascap over royalty fees in the suit the company sought to advocate for lower licensing fees on all the songs represented by the ascaps  members on february   pandora announced a hourpermonth limit on free mobile listening pandora ceo tim westergren cited escalating royalty costs as the reason for the mobile cap in a ruling made public earlier this year us district judge denise cote ruled that pandoras rate paid to ascap should remain the same— she cited p  troubling coordination between two of the biggest publishing companies sony and umpg and ascap that alludes to core antitrust concern in the industry after arguing that both ascap and bmi were showing bias towards international broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations pandora announced on june   that it would attempt to acquire kxmz a radio station in south dakota under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iheartradio which is owned by iheartmedia inc itself americas largest radio broadcaster the move was criticized by david israelite ceo of the national music publishers association who declared that pandora was now at war with songwriters and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to lawsuits and gimmicks to make its point however a member of public knowledge praised the move by stating that it was a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we get from a music licensing system that is based on who wants a license instead of just what they want to do with the music they’re using ascap also objected to the deal filing a petition to deny with the fcc the organization argued that the acquisition was not in the public interest because of pandoras intent to use it as a bargaining chip for royalty payments ascap also alleged that pandora did not provide enough information about its ownership structure failing to prove that less than  of the company was owned by foreign interests on january   the fcc denied the acquisition until pandora demonstrates adequate support for its foreign ownership compliance certification on september   pandora removed the hourpermonth limit on free mobile listening originally announced on february   pandora stated that it was able to make this change thanks to the rapid progress of its mobile advertising in  pandora signed an agreement with some music copyright owners for lower royalties in exchange for more frequent streaming of songs though not illegal this practice raised comparisons to payola which is illegal payment for airplay on terrestrial radio on september   pandora released pandora plus a new subscription service to compete with other streaming services the price was set at  and was available in later months receptionedit in may  pandora was named in leads  hottest san francisco companies list in  entertainment weekly compared a number of music services and granted pandora a b writing free streaming radio  a year to go adfree launched in  pandora is available on just about every platform theres no ondemand though and stations tend to draw from a relatively small pool of albums as of march  the annual option was eliminated and the us monthly plan was the only way to get pandora one the price rose to us a month in july  the annual subscription was brought back and is now us a year advertisingedit before pandora introduced advertising it initially offered a subscriptiononly service without commercials however the idea of paying did not sit well with most us consumers and the company had to consider alternative business models to offer a free service then in december  pandora sold its first advertisement in  pandora began playing more advertisements per hour in certain geographies and demographics pandora normally plays no more than  advertisements per hour for free users revenueedit pandora became fairly popular within just two years starting from  to  pandoras registered users had increased from  million to  million the companys revenue increased from  million to  million in which a majority of it from advertising in order to appeal to a large audience of consumers pandora offers adfree access for  a year during its  fiscal year pandora reported  million in revenue with a  million net loss excluding the cost of a special dividend associated with the ipo overall pandora controls  percent of internet radio and it has a  percent share of the us public radio finally in  industrywide total radio ad revenue increased to  billion in the us pitch to advertisersedit pandora obtains its advertisers by explaining that the company reaches a narrower audience compared to terrestrial radio pandoras pitch to advertisers is that its technology can cater to consumers with far greater precision than radio – it can pinpoint listeners by age and sex zip code or even musical taste methods of advertisingedit there are a few different methods of advertising on pandora audio advertising comes in spots of  to  seconds and run once every  minutes however users only encounter ads if they are engaging with the site like contributing a thumbs up or a thumbs down when changing a song or station next there are banner ads which are featured on the wallpaper of the site as noted by the new york times banner ads are on pandora in order to promote engagement audio segments can be accompanied by clickable display ads offering coupons or product information advertising on pandora works through a method of collecting data from the users online browsing activity once the data is collected the company uses the data to show the user target ads this process of advertising is also known as behavioral advertising pandora offers its users the option of submitting out of the targeted ads by a optout configuration on its website optingout will only prevent targeted ads meaning users may continue to see generic nontargeted ads from these companies after they optout eventually pandora offers either targeted advertisements or generic advertisements for its nonsubscribed users however pandoras advertising does not offer local content such as the local news weather traffic and talk market segmentsedit pandora has created two market segments one for spanish listeners and another for english listeners by creating multiple market segments pandoras advertising is customized to its users needs in order to create the first two market segments the company crossreferenced its registered user data with us census then the cross reference allows the company to identify zip codes with high populations of hispanic and spanishspeaking people and finally it ran tests overlaying the two data sets to infer which listeners fit into those buckets internet radio competitorsedit starting in the early s new entrants entered the personalized radio market such as grooveshark launched  iheartradio launched  mogcom tunein founded  accuradio rhapsody launched  and europes spotify all threatening to use the concept of true ondemand access to online music as a challenge to pandoras personalized radio europes most popular online streaming music service spotify launched in  and arrived in the us in mid as of  spotify has a catalogue of over  million songs compared to pandoras library of around  –  million as pointed out by editors miranda ferrara and michele lameau spotify allows users to upload their own songs to the online library while pandora allows listeners to connect to the social media site facebook to see what their friends are listening to spotify users can quickly and easily share playlists with their friends through facebook twitter email and sms text messages the second competitor that is targeting pandoras personalized radio appeal is iheartradio editors miranda ferrara and michele lameau note iheartradio is the largest radio operator in the united states with  million listeners and  stations in  markets iheartradio like pandora offers listeners the opportunity to like or dislike a song in order to receive recommendations on other tunes it also offers custom tools that allow the listener to discover new artists or more songs based on existing choices sirius xm has also become a competitor in recent years due to onlineonly accounts and being able to customize stations their wide availability in both the new and used car market also gives it an advantage over pandora when acquiring xm satellite radio in  sirius actually accurately predicted that it would be competing against streaming services like pandora in its argument with the federal communications commission fcc over whether the merging of the only two satellite radio companies in north america would cause antitrust issues as recognized by the ad age staff pandora has about  million monthly users and about a  share of the internet radio market in the us ad age predicted that competition would likely intensify due to apples acquisition of the beats music service but apple announced that it would be closing the service on november   yet even with all of its competition pandoras promoted stations rely on its core music genome project overall the music genome project of more than  attributes assigned to each song with a humancurated database of recorded music gives a big edge over competitors like spotify and

like the company quickly ran through its initial two million dollars in funding and in  the company ran out of money founder tim westergren convinced the fifty employees of the company to work for two years without pay initially the company pursued a transitional strategy of technology licensing to third parties including aol best buy barnes  noble and tower records in  the company returned to its initial vision of producing customized radio stations and changed its name to pandora media the website began as only a paid service but quickly changed to an advertising service to make it also

publishers featuresedit streamingedit a station is set by specifying an artist or song or a combination of multiple items of any kind in a single station listeners can tune into premade genre stations other users stations or create their own stations based on their musical interests each track played can be responded to with favorable thumbs up or unfavorable thumbs down buttons which determine if it should be played and how much should similarly classified songs be played in the station a second negative response to the same artist will ban that artist from the selected station unless the user has marked the artist positively on another occasion or if that artist is listed under the stations variety no response is applicable to musical attributes or to albums an unfavorable response immediately stops play of the track clicking the thumbs down or skipping to the next song too many times in a row will result in a short ban of skips pandora also utilizes short advertisements in between every couple of songs in addition a menu is provided with the choices im tired of this song allowing users to remove a song from the station temporarily although it counts as a skip why was this song selected allowing users to learn more about the composition of each song move song to another station new station and bookmark a buy button is located at the top of each song block as well from there listeners can click on links to buy the song from itunes or amazon there is a setting in each members account regarding whether the user wants songs with explicit lyrics played this however applies exclusively to song versions from albums with the parental advisory label as other songs with censored versions will have that version played an example is jet airliner by the steve miller band which had one word censored for radio play with explicit lyrics off that version will play because the album did not have a pa label while listening users are offered the ability to buy the songs or albums at various online retailers over  different musical attributes are considered when selecting the next song these  attributes are combined into larger groups called focus traits there are  focus traits examples of these are rhythm syncopation key tonality vocal harmonies and displayed instrumental proficiency the service has two subscription plans a free subscription supported by

pandoras one service windows and mac users can download a desktop application for pandora that uses the adobe air without using a web browser to access pandora all the normal functionality is included such as thumbs updown skip pause and access to all channels on a users account business modeledit pandora decided to be a consumeroriented music discovery service specifically a noninteractive radio station in the three months that ended october   advertising comprised  of pandoras total revenues a figure of  was reported for this metric in december  rpm revenue per s of hours is determined based on cpms cost per thousand impressions cpms are largely dependent upon network effects and thus increase as a website scales and adds users as such pandoras strategy in order to allow for widespread distribution was to offer a service unbundled from devices and transport pandora is currently working with systemonchip manufacturers to embed its technologies on the chips they sell to consumer electronics manufacturers like samsung sony and panasonic pandoras cost structure is highly variable with content acquisition costs representing roughly  of total costs there are three main costs associated with content acquisition first soundexchange collects content fees on behalf of labels or artists on the recording themselves these are by far the largest content acquisition costscitation needed second pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as bmi ascap or sesac in order to compensate composers songwriters and publishers lastly pandora also pays rovi for song and artist information this has recently been structured as a flat monthly fee high variable costs mean that pandora does not have significant operating leverage and in the next couple years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly oneninth the rate of desktop hours since pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the users platform the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours mobile revenues will improve over time as pandora shifts from relying on thirdparty ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at premium rates in january  pandora met with investment banks to consider a possible  million ipo the company filed with the sec for a mm ipo on february   and officially began trading on the new york stock exchange with ticker symbol p on june   at a price of share this gave them a valuation of nearly  billion pandora announced  million in total revenue for their first quarter of fiscal  which was up  over their previous year q results of the  million  million came from advertising while the other  million came from subscription in addition pandora has seen a  advertising revenue increase and a  subscription revenue increase yearoveryear however the vast majority of pandoras users remain on the free adsupported model royaltiesedit in  a federal panel agreed with a soundexchange request and ordered a doubling of the persong performance royalty that web radio stations pay to performers and record companies under this scheme internet radio would pay double the royalty paid by satellite radio because of the passage of dmca in  that increased fees and asked for licensing guarantees the pandora service is no longer available in countries other than australia new zealand and the united states these rulings affect all usbased internetbased radio stations terrestrial radio is not affected as of july  pandora was in talks with major music labels regarding royalty issues to allow a return to the european market costs remain a concern because of european royalty standards and a low demand for paid music services in  the founder of pandora stated that the company may be on the verge of collapse royalty fees account for a majority portion of pandoras revenues if an agreement between pandora and soundexchange had not been reached it could have meant the end of pandora were losing money as it is said tim westergren the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money on september   a bill was passed by the us house and senate to allow sites like pandora to continue negotiations with soundexchange into  on july   pandora announced that an agreement had been reached regarding the royalty issue which would significantly reduce the royalty rate making it possible for pandora to stay in business also announced was that free listening would be limited to  hours per month but can be extended to unlimited for that month for usd the revised royalties are quite high the companys blog notes higher in fact than any other form of radio the extended listening fee differs from upgrading which also disables advertisements increases the bitrate from  to  kbps and provides a dedicated music player as opposed to listening through browser this service known as pandora one costs  and is billed annually pandora has since introduced an option to purchase pandora one subscriptions on a monthly basis at a rate of  per month also in september  pandora began working with hitbliss to make pandora one subscriptions available for hitbliss earnedpayment with an update to the pandora player in september  the  hour cap was extended to  hours on november   pandora reported its q earnings royalty costs accounted for  of revenue slightly better than expected its revenue most of it from advertising continues to rise at respectable rates not only has pandora attracted more users but the average number of hours per user have also increased pandora now accounts for an estimated  of total us listening hours as pandora grows it hopes to gain leverage on music labels and drive royalty costs down on december   the ceo of spotify daniel ek announced spotify radio would offer an unlimited number of stations and unlimited skips though pandoras usage is  mobile the spotify radio app competes against pandoras mobile market pandora ceo tim westergren has supported the internet radio fairness act or irfa hr s  which would reduce the companys royalty payments to the performers by  percent on november   pandora filed suit in federal district court against ascap over royalty fees in the suit the company sought to advocate for lower licensing fees on all the songs represented by the ascaps  members on february   pandora announced a hourpermonth limit on free mobile listening pandora ceo tim westergren cited escalating royalty costs as the reason for the mobile cap in a ruling made public earlier this year us district judge denise cote ruled that pandoras rate paid to ascap should remain the same— she cited p  troubling coordination between two of the biggest publishing companies sony and umpg and ascap that alludes to core antitrust concern in the industry after arguing that both ascap and bmi were showing bias towards international broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations pandora announced on june   that it would attempt to acquire kxmz a radio station in south dakota under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iheartradio which is owned by iheartmedia inc itself americas largest radio broadcaster the move was criticized by david israelite ceo of the national music publishers association who declared that pandora was now at war with songwriters and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to lawsuits and gimmicks to make its point however a member of public knowledge praised the move by stating that it was a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we get from a music licensing system that is based on who wants a license instead of just what they want to do with the music they’re using ascap also objected to the deal filing a petition to deny with the fcc the organization argued that the acquisition was not in the public interest because of pandoras intent to use it as a bargaining chip for royalty payments ascap also alleged that pandora did not provide enough information about its ownership structure failing to prove that less than  of the company was owned by foreign interests on january   the fcc denied the acquisition until pandora demonstrates adequate support for its foreign ownership compliance certification on september   pandora removed the hourpermonth limit on free mobile listening originally announced on february   pandora stated that it was able to make this change thanks to the rapid progress of its mobile advertising in  pandora signed an agreement with some music copyright owners for lower royalties in exchange for more frequent streaming of songs though not illegal this practice raised comparisons to payola which is illegal payment for airplay on terrestrial radio on september   pandora released pandora plus a new subscription service to compete with other streaming services the price was set at  and was available in later months receptionedit in may  pandora was named in leads  hottest san francisco companies list in  entertainment weekly compared a number of music services and granted pandora a b writing free streaming radio  a year to go adfree launched in  pandora is available on just about every platform theres no ondemand though and stations tend to draw from a relatively small pool of albums as of march  the annual option was eliminated and the us monthly plan was the only way to get pandora one the price rose to us a month in july  the annual subscription was brought back and is now us a year advertisingedit before pandora introduced advertising it initially offered a subscriptiononly service without commercials however the idea of paying did not sit well with most us consumers and the company had to consider alternative business models to offer a free service then in december  pandora sold its first advertisement in  pandora began playing more advertisements per hour in certain geographies and demographics pandora normally plays no more than  advertisements per hour for free users revenueedit pandora became fairly popular within just two years starting from  to  pandoras registered users had increased from  million to  million the companys revenue increased from  million to  million in which a majority of it from advertising in order to appeal to a large audience of consumers pandora offers adfree access for  a year during its  fiscal year pandora reported  million in revenue with a  million net loss excluding the cost of a special dividend associated with the ipo overall pandora controls  percent of internet radio and it has a  percent share of the us public radio finally in  industrywide total radio ad revenue increased to  billion in the us pitch to advertisersedit pandora obtains its advertisers by explaining that the company reaches a narrower audience compared to terrestrial radio pandoras pitch to advertisers is that its technology can cater to consumers with far greater precision than radio – it can pinpoint listeners by age and sex zip code or even musical taste methods of advertisingedit there are a few different methods of advertising on pandora audio advertising comes in spots of  to  seconds and run once every  minutes however users only encounter ads if they are engaging with the site like contributing a thumbs up or a thumbs down when changing a song or station next there are banner ads which are featured on the wallpaper of the site as noted by the new york times banner ads are on pandora in order to promote engagement audio segments can be accompanied by clickable display ads offering coupons or product information advertising on pandora works through a method of collecting data from the users online browsing activity once the data is collected the company uses the data to show the user target ads this process of advertising is also known as behavioral advertising pandora offers its users the option of submitting out of the targeted ads by a optout configuration on its website optingout will only prevent targeted ads meaning users may continue to see generic nontargeted ads from these companies after they optout eventually pandora offers either targeted advertisements or generic advertisements for its nonsubscribed users however pandoras advertising does not offer local content such as the local news weather traffic and talk market segmentsedit pandora has created two market segments one for spanish listeners and another for english listeners by creating multiple market segments pandoras advertising is customized to its users needs in order to create the first two market segments the company crossreferenced its registered user data with us census then the cross reference allows the company to identify zip codes with high populations of hispanic and spanishspeaking people and finally it ran tests overlaying the two data sets to infer which listeners fit into those buckets internet radio competitorsedit starting in the early s new entrants entered the personalized radio market such as grooveshark launched  iheartradio launched  mogcom tunein founded  accuradio rhapsody launched  and europes spotify all threatening to use the concept of true ondemand access to online music as a challenge to pandoras personalized radio europes most popular online streaming music service spotify launched in  and arrived in the us in mid as of  spotify has a catalogue of over  million songs compared to pandoras library of around  –  million as pointed out by editors miranda ferrara and michele lameau spotify allows users to upload their own songs to the online library while pandora allows listeners to connect to the social media site facebook to see what their friends are listening to spotify users can quickly and easily share playlists with their friends through facebook twitter email and sms text messages the second competitor that is targeting pandoras personalized radio appeal is iheartradio editors miranda ferrara and michele lameau note iheartradio is the largest radio operator in the united states with  million listeners and  stations in  markets iheartradio like pandora offers listeners the opportunity to like or dislike a song in order to receive recommendations on other tunes it also offers custom tools that allow the listener to discover new artists or more songs based on existing choices sirius xm has also become a competitor in recent years due to onlineonly accounts and being able to customize stations their wide availability in both the new and used car market also gives it an advantage over pandora when acquiring xm satellite radio in  sirius actually accurately predicted that it would be competing against streaming services like pandora in its argument with the federal communications commission fcc over whether the merging of the only two satellite radio companies in north america would cause antitrust issues as recognized by the ad age staff pandora has about  million monthly users and about a  share of the internet radio market in the us ad age predicted that competition would likely intensify due to apples acquisition of the beats music service but apple announced that it would be closing the service on november   yet even with all of its competition pandoras promoted stations rely on its core music genome project overall the music genome project of more than  attributes assigned to each song with a humancurated database of recorded music gives a big edge over competitors like spotify and beats music owned and operated stationsedit south dakota kxmz –  – hotac see alsoedit list of internet radio stations list of online music databases notesedit referencesedit  a b c d e guglielmo
