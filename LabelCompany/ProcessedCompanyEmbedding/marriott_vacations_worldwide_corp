reasons to be bullish on the industrymay  about marriott vacations vac yuksel dincer cfa cfa hotels midcap longterm horizonyuksel dincer cfasummarythe vacation ownership industry is misunderstood and misvalued by the market average industry evadjusted ebitda is x versus x for hotel companiesthis is due to the lack of transparency and complexity of the business model recent public transactions will offer better understanding of vacation ownership companiesthe resulting visibility will increase industry competition innovation and margin the product will also evolve and will attract new customers bringing a new source of growthrecent innovation in inventory acquisition strategies is a proof of modernization of the industrythe longterm pick here is marriott vacations worldwide corp the company offers the most established and proven business modelthe vacation ownership vo industry has historically been overlooked by investors due to its complexity size and lack of visibility we believe the recent public transactions in the industry offer investors a better understanding of and an opportunity to take a closer look at the performance of vo companies in the past vo companies were managed by parent companies competition between vo companies was minimal as public visibility was low and barriers to entry were high today the majority of pure players are standalone public companies and we believe the resulting visibility will give a boost to the industry increasing competition and transparency increased competition will drive innovation improve margin and transparency and reduce the cost of complexity the first step of public pressure was absorbed by lodging companies as all of them except for wyndham nysewyn have spun off their vo entities the second step of this pressure will be on vo companies this will stretch them to innovate and improve performance vo companies have already innovated their inventory acquisition strategies by shifting towards assetlight strategies this innovation was due to public pressure pushing vo companies to stabilize cash flow spending we believe the next stage of innovation is on the vo product itself industry overview the vo industry is small public companies account for approximately  billion in market cap and represent approximately half of the industry in term of sales the other half of the industry is mostly unbranded private timeshare operators the four publicly traded and branded vo companies are hilton grand vacations nysehgv ilg inc nasdaqilg marriott vacation worldwide nysevac and wyndham hotels  resorts wyn a combination of a vo exchange and hotel companies bluegreen has not been included in this article as it is part of bbx capital nasdaqbbxt and has limited analyst coverage the vo product is under pressure but it is also appreciated by a certain type of consumer at public companies more than half of vo sales are to existing owners we believe the vo product will slowly evolve to attract more customers and that this evolution will be accelerated due to public exposure customer acquisition is the biggest challenge for vo companies today and price and commitment are the biggest challenges for customer acquisition there is a large untapped market in the us and overseas for vo companies once the product evolves to reach new customers the potential for growth will be huge valuation currently the market values public vo companies at x evadjusted ebitda we believe complexity and lack of transparency is affecting valuation it is difficult to run historical comparisons due to the volume of transactions that have taken place recently but a quick comparison to hotel companies choice hotels international nysechh hyatt hotels corp nyseh hilton worldwide holdings nysehlt marriott international nysemar is helpful we do not argue that the valuation of vo companies should be equal to that of hotel companies but we believe over time with increased transparency and marketfriendly assetlight strategies the valuation gap will tighten the market has encountered challenges with respect to understanding the complex nature of vo companies the cost of this has been complexity and limited upside potential in our opinion there are two main factors driving these challenges complexity  the industry is complex each vo company is a combination of a real estate developer a bank and a hotel company vo companies are improving their messaging to the street and we believe the understanding of the industrys complex business model will get better over time lack of transparency  financial reporting by vo companies could be more transparent and consistent which would allow for better comparisons between vo companies it is currently complex to create industry comparables as there isnt a formal reporting standard such as the uniform systems of accounts for the lodging industry we believe this is an area where vo companies should collaborate growth and margin improvement potential further proof that the product is still successful is the sales guidance of public vo companies we are currently at a challenging point in the lodging cycle and  sales growth guidance for vo companies is  this compares to  revpar growth for hotel companies firstquarter results were strong for vo companies showing  growth yoy this compares to  revpar growth for hotel companies note that vo sales are nonsame store and we believe samestore metrics would be a good step towards transparency we also believe there is potential for margin improvement due to two factors innovation in the industry to reduce sales  marketing costs which today represent  of sales volume per guest vpg or total sales divided by tours is the main metric looked at by the market vpg is a revenue metric and doesnt consider costs once the market begins to scrutinize cost per guest cpg or sales  marketing costs  product costs divided by sales vo companies will be pressured to lower costs thereby increasing margin increased involvement of the real estate community in the vo industry vo properties are a separate asset class combining the benefits of residential and hotel assets conversion to vo of underperforming hotel assets has been proven successful with a larger market involvement vo companies will have more choices for assets and growth can be substantial as every new market brings new customers we believe the number of mixeduse hotelvo properties will grow in the future as it is the perfect vehicle to solve problems faced by both the owners of underperforming hotels and vo companies looking to enter new markets for the reasons above we are optimistic about the future of the vo industry we will now examine what market pressure has pushed vo companies to do in the past on the inventory acquisition front inventory acquisition structures the most important aspect for growth of a vo company is inventory acquisition without inventory there are no sales and without sales there is no resort or bank income we highlight below recent innovations by vo companies in inventory acquisitions as proof that they can innovate when required historically vo companies have been capitalintensive and have developed properties in one phase spending large amounts of capital upfront investors did not like that and pushed vo companies which were generally owned at that time by larger lodging companies to innovate and pursue more assetlight strategies assetlight consists of limiting capital spending upfront the most common version is a multiphase development where vo companies build or acquire inventory over time to match the pace of sales assetlight improves the balance sheet and roic the different inventory strategies are note that in addition to the three structures above vo companies also acquire inventory from defaults and buybacks in general the only difference between the one phase and multiphase developments is pts of product costs therefore it made sense for companies to pursue assetlight strategies and focus on multiphase groundup developments some vo companies partner with a third party that acquires or owns an asset and sells it over time to the vo company on the far end of assetlight lies fee for service the most active public company in fee for service is hgv note that bluegreen is also active in fee for service and wyn also has very limited fee for service sales on a fee for service project the vo company acts as a sales agent and sells inventory owned by a third party the margin is much lower than that for developing or acquiring the asset as the third party generally keeps the notes and resort income the benefit of fee for service is that it limits the capital outflow to only building the sales center however the lack of financing and resort income is an issue for us as these are usually larger than developer income the following example may help to demonstrate the differences between the three development strategies discussed above note that all deals are different and this is a highlevel example the table below is representative of a  million sales project sold over  years we assume no upgrade on the fee for service structure if we were to assume upgrades on the fee for service project income will be even lower the first two options one phase and multiphase are roughly similar the cost of delaying capital to the vo company is approximately  of the project income this table also shows the importance of the bank segment for a vo company on  million of sales vo companies will generate  million of interest income fee for service is the pinnacle of assetlight strategies and should therefore be the favorite of the market the issue we think is that it generates much less income than the two other options due to the lack of resort and financing income for the same amount of sales income generated is only a quarter of the other options this is the reason why we are not positive about hgvs business model which is  fee for service there are obvious reasons behind why hgv has chosen the fee for service path notably to limit capital spending and grow its member base in our opinion however the opportunity cost is too big we can argue that there are no opportunity costs as there would not be a project if it were not fee for service we note however that hgv was part of blackstone when its fee for service deals were executed and hgv is currently reducing its fee for service footprint in our opinion for a public company today there is limited value in executing fee for service deals unless access to capital is an issue  which is not the case for hgv with current reporting from hgv it is not possible to exactly calculate margin on sales that are not fee for service as we mentioned earlier more transparency will help with this these recent innovations on the inventory acquisition front drive our view that vo companies will innovate on the product itself and the industry is positioned for tremendous growth our favorite vac so which is our industry favorite our longterm pick is vac while we believe the industry will perform well in the long term we think vac will outperform its competitors for the following reasons  great potential for tour growth the tourperunit ratio at vac is lower than the industry average note that the company does not report tour flow another transparency improvement opportunity so we have calculated this metric by dividing sales by vpg we note that this will mostly overstate tour flow due to call center sales where no tours are reported it is also important to note that what is reported as a unit by vo companies is not equivalent to a hotel room for example marriotts desert springs villas ii in palm desert has  hotel rooms equivalent to  units therefore the same metric per key instead of per tour would give a different answer but will tell the same story what does this mean and what is driving these differences in tourperunit ratios across vo companies we dont think the answer is a bigger proportion of resorts being sold out thereby reducing availability for tours in our opinion the answer lies in marketing strategy there are two marketing channels that generate a very large tourperunit ratio the first channel is affiliation with hotels in the area to drive tour flow as an example the west th street by hilton club property in new york may tour guests that are staying at the new york hilton midtown hotel the latter property is not part of hgv therefore this is inflating the tourperunit ratio the affiliation channel represents  of hgv sales according to the companys latest investor presentation hgvs tourperunit ratio without hotel affiliation would be  at constant vpg the second marketing channel is marketing packages offered by vo companies as part of the fee for service strategy hgv offers many marketing packages and therefore fills the properties with guests that are expected to tour the downside is a lower rental availability as rooms are used to generate sales this lowers resort income we believe vac should be able to accelerate these two channels if necessary and the potential sales opportunity is significant as demonstrated by the calculation below the margin will be different as cpg is usually high for these two channels  vacs inventory and incremental distribution strategy is on point as mentioned earlier inventory acquisition is the most important part of a vo business in the past year vac acquired converted and opened sales centers in multiple cities including urban destinations such as new york these sales center are performing well according to management since the execution of these newly created sales centers was successful we believe vac will be able to replicate the process in other us cities  the company has a strong track record in acquiring a hotel partially converting it to vo and selling the remainder as a hotel vac purchased the surfers paradise hotel in australia in  and is transforming a portion of the hotel to vo the remaining hotel portion has been sold in  we believe it is well positioned to execute similar transactions which will provide additional distribution opportunities  financial position vac has an unlevered balance sheet strong cash flow generation and has demonstrated recent improvements in roic we believe there are opportunities in ma in the industry and that vac is well positioned to execute these conclusion in conclusion we believe the recent public transactions in the industry will be a catalyst for vo companies product innovation and margin improvement will be accelerated due this increased visibility the vo industry has shown the strength in the past to adjust to market expectations and we believe the recent innovations to inventory acquisition will be brought next to the product itself we also think vo companies should be more transparent and consistent in financial reporting this will benefit everyone to better understand the strong business fundamentals and improve valuation with the proven success of hoteltovo conversion by multiple companies in multiple locations we believe asset owners and developers will consider vo as a potential redevelopment opportunity and will partner with vo companies this will create an additional growth source for the industry the vo industry is at a turning point and we expect it to embrace increased transparency and take advantage of the many opportunities to grow disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks
