by investing in a specific geographic region a regional fund’s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio the emerging europe fund invests more than  of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil  gas or banking industries the risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund’s performance more volatile because the global resources fund concentrates its investments

fluctuate in response to sectorrelated and other risks as described in the fund prospectus morningstar ratings are based on riskadjusted return the overall morningstar rating for a fund is derived from a weightedaverage of the performance figures associated with its three five and tenyear if applicable morningstar rating metrics past performance does not guarantee future results for each fund with at least a threeyear history morningstar calculates a morningstar rating based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance including the effects of sales charges loads and redemption fees placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately which may

capital group emerging markets total opportunities fund managers draw upon a vast and deep well of emerging markets research and are aided by dedicated quantitative research analysts who help them identify securities with the best expected riskreturn tradeoffs given the goal of reduced volatility the team consists of four portfolio managers all with experience in both debt and equity investing

relationship between them — to create a comprehensive view of the emerging markets universe they have the flexibility to use a variety of investments including forwards warrants and cash instruments dedicated quantitative analysts provide the portfolio managers with information on a variety of risk parameters for securities markets and the overall portfolio these analysts are also responsible for monitoring individual managers’ portfolios tracking their progress and identifying any unintended biases that may arise we recognize that exceptional periods in the markets — often marked by high volatility and risk aversion — can provide attractive opportunities our process allows portfolio managers to exceed predetermined risk parameters with the objective of maximizing returns over the long

the global emerging markets gem opportunities strategy seeks a high conviction concentrated valueoriented strategy managed by the cio of the emerging markets equity team richard titherington it uses a unique investment process which combines topdown and bottomup views from our worldwide network of experienced investment specialists   investment philosophy our investment philosophy is to identify highconviction value opportunities this results in anomalies—notably the longrun outperformance of value strategies—which can be exploited through a rigorous process to generate excess returns   jp morgan asset management’s emerging markets equity team has been a specialist investor in emerging markets for over  years and the senior investors have  to  years of experience in the asset class we seek to achieve superior performance through an investment process that makes full use of our leading research platform we combine topdown research into countries sectors and currencies with bottomup stockpicking by our team of fundamental analysts in order to identify areas of highest conviction in our search for value   investment process we seek to outperform by using multiple approaches topdownbottomup quantitative screensfundamental analysis to build a concentrated highconviction valueoriented portfolio   idea generation is a team activity the lead portfolio manager richard titherington concentrates his time on portfolio construction and risk management the backup manager amit mehta supports the lead portfolio manager by working with the analysts on idea generation   we believe combining topdown and bottomup investment views is both a differentiating feature of our process and a competitive advantage over the longterm approximately half the returns in gem equities can be explained by stock specific factors and half by country and sector influences   we have a clear hierarchy of decision making which starts with a longstanding belief that rising domestic demand and incomes present the best longterm investment opportunity in emerging markets this leads to a bias in favor of domestic sectors rather than cyclical sectors we then establish views about countries in regular asset allocation meetings during which the senior gem and regional portfolio managers use the ranking from our country model as the basis for debate   finally we look for companies that fit those topdown views we use stock level screens for the initial idea generation but only take positions in stocks in which the relevant analyst has a deep fundamental understanding of the business and high conviction in the outperformance potential of the stock   key benefits a high conviction valueoriented strategy multiple approaches by combining screens and fundamental analysis an investment
