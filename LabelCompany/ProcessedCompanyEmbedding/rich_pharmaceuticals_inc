promotion could be set to dropapr  about rich pharmaceuticals rcha penny stock realist short onlypenny stock realistsummarythere is illegal spam stock promotion being sent outthere are  free trading shares in insiders handsthey are even sending spam to government emails not smartrich pharmaceuticals incotcqbrcha is a name that i believe is currently the target of an illegal spam pennystock promotion scheme it is my view that the stocks intrinsic value is somewhere near  and it is with conviction that i recommend that any investors currently in the name sell the entirety of their stakes immediately todays morning weakness could be a signal that the dump is near i also believe that rich pharmaceuticals inc is a stock definitely worth shorting my track record of identifying and publicly exposing such highly overvalued equities is excellent company background rich pharmaceuticals inc rcha is a biopharmaceutical company developing a treatment for acute myelocytic leukemia amlwhite blood cell elevation and other blood related diseases rich pharmaceuticals goal is to extend refractory patients life expectancy and increase quality of life rich pharmaceuticals primary development stage product candidate which is known as pd is being designed to treat blood and cancer related diseases through none evasive outpatient facilities find out more at richpharmaceuticalscom little revenue debts no business bright future as is usually the case with these types of hyped up scams it takes only one quick glance at the balance sheet to realize that the m market capitalization that this equity commands is beyond ludicrous with no shot of any drugs being approved until  that is expecting they pass all trials which no one knows if they even will its my suspicion that the purpose of this company is not to succeed but to sell stock the recent volume is due to overly bullish promotional spam picture of rchachart you can see that trading in rich pharmaceuticals inc started seeing really big increased volume on apr   a simple twitter search and you can see multiple people reporting to have gotten spam on sunday april th coincidence with the time of spam and increased volume in rich pharmaceuticals inc absolutely not spam email they are even sending spam to government emails not smart this raises the potential for a sec halt disclaimer there is none this is illegal reasoning for spam after going through all the filings you come to the conclusion that there are  free trading shares in anonymous shareholders hands it is obvious that one or more of those shareholders has hired a spam group why would they do that they did that because they are looking to cash out you cant sell unless there are suckers to buy your free trading shares as you can see the spam campaign has brought buyers insiders can dump their shares now this will end ugly you have been warned recent sec halts the sec is finally cracking down on pump and dumps lately here is a list of big stock promotions that have been halted recently i believe rich pharmaceuticals inc has a chance to be next my latest report on a illegal spam pump on imogo mobile technologies corp was followed by an sec halt i believe the halt risk is very high for rich pharmaceuticals inc especially with seeing tweets like this here they are sending spam even to government employees not smart stocks that get halted tend to reopen  weeks later down  my latest report on imogo mobile technologies corp was halted five trading days after my report was published makism d corp and life stem genetics were two pumps that halted the day after my articles as well imogo mobile technologies corp otcqbimtc halted february   center energy inc otccnto halted february   makism d corp otcqbmdddhalted december   guar global ltdgmotcotcotcotcggbl halted december   neveda gold corp gmotcotcotcotcnvgc halted november   life stem genetics inc gm halted november   sovereign lithium gmotcotcotcotcslco halted november   my recommendation if you own shares of this company get out now do not hope that you can hang on to sell them to a greater fool these shares are worthless i have showed you that the reason for the promotional spam indicates that the individuals behind this stock scam are trying desperately to unload their worthless shares onto the unsuspecting public and book a huge profit before the inevitable collapse if you are a more sophisticated investor and can get a borrow on these shares then i believe that shorting this name will be highly lucrative for you in this stage of the promotion with the stock halt risk it is not worth staying long overnight to make  more in gains when there is a risk of  in losses spam promotions tend to do much worse then other promotions if your interested in taking a look of some recent spam promotions take a look at prfc imtc nvgc disclosure i am short rcha i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for

leukemia aml is an aggressive disease that generally warrants urgent and intensive therapy the average patient age at aml diagnosis is  to  years and patients over the age of  treated with standard chemotherapy are cured of their disease less than  percent of the time patients who develop aml after an antecedent hematologic disorder or prior leukemogenic chemotherapyradiation therapy have similarly poor outcomes as do patients whose disease is associated with specific cytogenetic and clinical features hence most patients diagnosed with aml have patient andor disease related features that are associated with a very poor prognosis for patients with relapsed disease no standard nontransplant therapy has demonstrated the capacity for cure for these patients aml is often a fatal disease new approaches to therapy are needed tpa is an acronym for otetradecanoylphorbolacetate a naturally occurring phorbol ester isolated from croton oil crotum tiglium tpa has been widely studied as a differentiating agent  a cytokine inducer  phorbol esters activate protein kinase pkc and modulate the activity of multiple downstream cell signaling pathway  the activity of tpa as a differentiating agent has been established by studies of hl human promyelocytic cells and primary human leukemia cells obtained from patients tpa induces a broad spectrum of biologic effects that provide a basis for suggesting that it may be useful in aml at the cellular level many of these effects may be mediated by protein kinase c protein kinase c is a family of phospholipid and calcium dependent isozymes that are activated by diacylglycerol tpa appears to be able to activate protein kinase c in the absence of diacylglycerol the targets of phosphorylation are incompletely defined but appear to result in the activation of several processes involved in cellular proliferation differentiation mitogenesis neurotransmission and hormone secretion two well characterized transcription activationrepression pathways regulated by nfkb and ap transcription complexes appear to be regulated by protein kinase c  science and technology our science product pipeline tpa for treatment of aml

hodgkin’s lymphoma   facts about hodgkins lymphoma description of hodgkins lymphoma hodgkins lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system malignant reed sternberg cells invade and destroy the architecture of the lymph nodes and infiltrate major organs such as the liver and spleen in more advanced cases stages iii and iv treatment options for hodgkins lymphoma are chemotherapy radiotherapy or chemotherapy plus radiotherapy more difficult cases may require high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant in addition to the stage of the disease other factors such as age general health and location of the disease are considered important in treatment decisions in recent years petct scans have been helpful in determining the extent of hodgkins disease and assessing how well treatment is working in some patients hodgkins may never go away completely and regular treatments are required to control the disease while others experience relapses nowadays chemotherapy plus radiotherapy to involved areas is considered as standard treatment for patients with early stage hodgkins lymphoma stages i and ii and the incidence of survival in the us after years is about  the year survival rate for stage iii patients is about  while it is  for stage iv patients due to long term adverse effects such as secondary malignancies causing both morbidity and mortality the role of radiotherapy has been questioned and other means of treatment are being sought incidence of hodgkins lymphoma this disease is a cancer that is found most frequently in two different age groups  to  and over  and occurs in both sexes although more common in males and individuals with hiv and in the third decade of life the overall incidence of hodgkins lymphoma is  per  persons and in the us  individuals were stricken with this disease in  the worldwide estimate for treatment of hodgkins lymphoma is estimated to be  to  billion the cause of hodgkins lymphoma is unknown but factors such as smoking and alcohol have been linked to this disease and siblings of with parents with hodgkins have an increased risk  to x of developing this disease the specific factors triggering the conversion of normal lymphocytes to hodgkins lymphoma cells is unknown facts about aml acute myelocytic leukemia aml acute myelocytic leukemia aml also known as acute myelogenous leukemia is the most common acute leukemia

and we look forward to patient enrollment at phramongkutklao hospital with the help of dr numbenjapon stated mr chang   rich pharmaceuticals announces institutional review board submission june   beverly hills california  rich pharmaceuticals inc otcpk rcha “rich” or the “company” a bio pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies in oncology an nounced today that has filed its submission package to the institutional review board irb of phramongkutklao hospital in bangkok thailand the submission is part of a process that leads to a study for the treatment of acute myelocytic leukemia aml in refractory patients in a phase iii trial “we are happy we’ve reached this milestone and we look forward to communicating further developments on this effort and other clinical milestones over time” said ben chang ceo the company irb submission was completed on may   an irb is a group that is formally desig nated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human patients this submission is an integral to the clinical trial and drug approval process    rich pharmaceuticals announces clinical site in thailand may   beverly hills california  rich pharmaceuticals inc otcpk rcha “rich” or the “company” a bio pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies in oncology an nounced today that it has selected a site and obtained investigator’s interest at phramongkutklao hospital in bangkok thailand rich has engaged cmic asiapacific pte ltd “cmic” to assist in this project and they have already completed a site selection visit at phramongkutklao hospital and the site has been cleared rich and cmic are preparing submission packages for the hospital’s internal review board irb and the thailand food and drug administration fda this package is near completion and the company plans to submit it shortly “the company has purchased product liability insurance the package is near completion and we hope to submit in the coming days” said ben chang ceo in cooperation with the hospital rich is seeking to conduct a study for the treatment of acute myelocytic leukemia aml in refractory patients in a phase iii trial acute myelocytic leukemia is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that build up in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells aml is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults and its incidence increases with age because the incidence increases with age it is expected that incidence will rise as population rises    our science rich pharmaceuticals currently is focused on the clinical development of the chemical molecule tpa otetradecanoylphorbolacetate for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia aml the company has technical evidence to suggest that it may also be useful to treat other important diseases resulting in it being a widely used drug with major market potential tpa tpa is a naturally occurring molecule that is isolated and purified from croton oil which is obtained from the seeds of croton tiglium a leafy shrub native to southeast asia while this has been the major source of tpa for clinical studies conducted by rich company scientists recently devised a synthetic route for preparation of the drug which will ensure providing the necessary supply of highly pure drug for clinical use tpa has characteristics that are unique to this chemical class including a potent ability to accelerate differentiation of the myeloid cell lines hl and thp as well as mononuclear phagocytes from bone marrow and peripheral blood the best characterized receptor for tpa is protein kinase c pkc which once activated induces substrate phosphorylation that propagates signals to the mapk cascades the effects of tpa on mapk pathways may be particularly relevant to the differentiating and proapoptotic effects of tpa in certain cells the capacity of tpa to activate pkc and to induce phenotypic changes characteristic of differentiation andor apoptosis led investigators to study its effect in aml what justifies the use of tpa to treat aml acute myelogenous leukemia aml is an aggressive disease that requires urgent and intensive therapy patients diagnosed with aml are on average between  and  years of age patients over  treated with standard chemotherapy are cured of their disease less that  percent of the time in addition patients who develop aml after an antecedent hematologic disorder or

poor prognosis for patients with relapsed disease no standard nontransplant therapy has demonstrated the capacity for cure and aml is often fatal in view of the above facts it is obvious that new approaches to therapy are needed the clinical studies completed and those currently in progress with tpa report feasibility and potential efficacy of this drug in patients with relapsedrefractory
