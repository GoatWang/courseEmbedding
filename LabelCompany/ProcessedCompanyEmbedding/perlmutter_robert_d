drinks threaten the brain the message that we should all dramatically reduce our sugar consumption is really gaining traction and for good reason this was a central theme of grain brain and these

seen the american heart association’s aha latest report but i’m sure you’ve probably seen the social media frenzy that followed their statements on coconut oil an article by usa today with the headline “coconut oil isn’t healthy it’s never been healthy” has been shared over a half a million times the aha rehashed their ageold dietary guidelines for fats and cholesterol attempting to finger them both as the cause of cardiovascular disease cvd but this time they took it one step further and took a stab at coconut oil stating however because coconut oil increases ldl cholesterol a cause of cvd and has no known offsetting favorable effects we advise against the use of coconut oil so what’s going on here is coconut oil suddenly not as good for you as we once thought or is the aha report

activeculture yogurt an explosion of yogurt brands has taken over the dairy section lately but you have to be careful about which brands to buy many of them—both greek and regular—are loaded with added sugar artificial sweeteners and artificial flavors read your labels for people sensitive to dairy coconut yogurt is an excellent dairyfree way to work plenty of enzymes and probiotics into your diet kefir the name kefir is derived from the turkish word keyif which means “feeling good” after consumption this fermented dairy product is very similar to yogurt it is a unique combination of kefir “grains” a combination of yeast and bacteria and goat’s milk that’s high in lactobacilli and bifidobacteria it’s also rich in antioxidants for those who are sensitive to dairy or lactose intolerant coconut kefir a nondairy version is also delicious and equally beneficial kombucha tea this is a form of fermented black or green tea that has been used for centuries fizzy and often served chilled it’s also believed to help increase energy and may even help you lose weight tempeh many people especially vegetarians eat tempeh as a substitute for meat tempeh is fermented soybeans and a complete protein with all of the amino acids also a great source of vitamin b tempeh can be cooked or crumbled over salads note not to be confused with unfermented soy the fermentation process reduces the levels of phytic acid in tempeh making it a much better option overall i am not a huge fan of any soy derived product but for vegetarians this is an option kimchi a traditional korean dish this is a mixture of fermented vegetables and seasonings common ingredients include cabbage brine radish and spices such as ginger and chili pepper in addition to providing beneficial bacteria kimchi is also a great source of calcium iron betacarotene and vitamins a c b and b for some it may be a little too spicy but it’s one of the best probiotic foods you can add to your diet if you can handle the heat sauerkraut a german word sauerkraut translates to “sour cabbage” not only does this fermented cabbage fuel healthy gut bacteria but it contains choline a chemical needed for the proper transmission of nerve impulses in the brain and throughout the central nervous system pickles no wonder many pregnant women crave pickles among the most basic and beloved natural probiotic for many pickles can be your gateway food to other more exotic fermented foods pickled fruits and vegetables pickling fruits and veggies such as carrot sticks transforms the usual into the extraordinary whether you do this yourself or buy pickled produce keep in mind that the probiotic benefits are only present in unpasteurized foods pickled in brine not vinegar cultured condiments believe it or not you can create lactofermented mayonnaise mustard horseradish hot sauce relish salsa guacamole salad dressing and fruit chutney sour cream while technically a fermented dairy product tends to lose its probiotic power during processing some manufacturers however add live cultures at the end of the process look for these brands fermented meat fish and eggs consumed in may traditional fares you can find some mouthwatering recipes from corned beef to pickled sardines and fermented hardboiled eggs in the recipes section of brain maker prebiotic foods acacia gum or gum arabic to reap the benefits of acacia gum you can buy acacia powder and mix it with water just  tablespoon will give you  grams of insoluble prebiotic fiber—the kind of fiber the gut bugs love for their own nourishment raw chicory root i use chicory root when cooking as it is an excellent source of antioxidants as well as a terrific system cleanser most of my chicory consumption comes via kimchi as it’s an ingredient i use when making kimchi at home and you can find the recipe in brain maker raw jerusalem artichoke jerusalem artichoke which you might know better as sunroot is actually a species of sunflower loaded with nutrients and health benefits specifically besides being a great prebiotic jerusalem artichoke is rich in potassium and iron during the week i enjoy jerusalem artichoke in salads raw dandelion greens dandelion greens are a rich source of prebiotics buy a bunch of these greens for the week and add them to salads and vegetable dishes raw garlic there are myriad health benefits to be derived from garlic and the fact that raw garlic is packed with prebiotics is just one of them lots of recipes here on my website to help you sort out how to make sure you get some in every day raw or cooked onion just like garlic onions are another vegetable you might be consuming every day without realizing just how powerful it is for your health in both raw and cooked form onions carry a strong prebiotic load raw leek

like kefir is a combination of two kingdoms  colonies of eubacteria and fungi i’ve always been attracted to kombucha but only recently did i bother to investigate what i was drinking there are other examples of bacteria and yeast ferments but they are not as powerful as kefir and kombucha julie i live in a rural area and in my little town there is only a walmart for grocery shopping i’m a

too expensive any suggestions brandon kombucha sauerkraut kimchi home made yogurt can all be made very easily at home and from ingredients from walmart in some cases a starter culture will be needed but others not for the some of the prebiotics acacia gum chickory root potato starch if you can’t find them locally they can all be ordered off amazon very reasonably and will be at your door in  days i would imagine that some of the fermented items could be ordered online as well but its a fraction of the price to make yourself julie thanks for the info i plan to start working on making these foods myself and then maybe i can spread the word im excited meredith hi julie cultureshealth is a great website to order starter cultures for kefir etc your cultures often grow so you could share them with others julie thanks i remember my mom making ginger beer and sharing with her friends reminds me of that helen driscoll any farms locally anyone starting gardens plants with pesco okinawans

like turmeric ginger greentea soy greens oodles of carotenoid veggies seaweed fish etc… annie dru it’s super easy to make your own probiotic sour cream or ‘creme fraiche’ at home all you need to do is

relish if you haven’t yet made a cultured food let this foolproof recipe be your gateway to tangible kitchen magic yes you can effortlessly transform the flavor and healthfulness of basic ingredients into a superior product i delight in the simplicity of this recipe and most often make it with just three ingredients but i also enjoy embellishing it with ginger or other spices and by adding up to  cup chopped pecans or walnuts the just mixed ingredients taste tart bitter and sugary but fermentation reduces the sugar heightens the berries’ own sweetness and gives the relish a feisty tang there is no need to add a starter yield  cups  ounces  cups fresh organic cranberries  organic orange seeded and chopped reserve  of the peel  cup honey or  cup cane sugar  teaspoon chopped ginger optional pick over the cranberries to remove any possible spoiled ones wash and drain well place the berries orange orange peel and honey in a food processor and coarsely chop do not reduce to a puree add the ginger andor nuts if using pack tightly into a clean widemouth jar cover and leave out at room temperature for  day taste it and use it now or to increase its zesty flavor let it ferment for an additional day or two as it ferments the color deepens to a dark red periodically taste it always with a clean spoon so you don’t introduce unwanted bacteria into your culture to appreciate its increasing vibrancy when the taste suits you cover and store it in the refrigerator for up to  weeks liz thanks this looks great michelle thank you for the intriguing “gateway” recipie looking forward to try it out 🙂 cairenn house thanks i need this for thanksgiving greg simkins i am confused about your position on kefir on this page you list kefir as a brain maker food in grain brain page  you say to use kefir “in moderation” once daily or preferably twice per week why shouldn’t we drink kefir by the gallon if it is so good for us lara hi greg here’s one possible explaination why you shouldn’t recall perlmutter said the importance of limiting dairy as kefir is a dairy product it would make sense why we should moderately eat it it is good for you but like everything else all good things are only good in moderation hope this helps susan i’d like to better understand why i should limit dairy although i think kefir – especially the homemade organic variety that uses grains for fermentation – is a different animal from a tall glass of whole milk is it fair to put kefir in the same nutritional category not that you have lara hi there susan great comment on the post kefir and whole milk both have excellent benefits the differences lies with taste fermentation as you’ve mentioned and fat content unless you buy kefir as a specialty brand made solely from soy or grains it typically is also a dairy product it usually has less fat than whole milk the fat in whole milk however is highly nutritious packed with fat soluble vitamins necessary for strong bones and teeth plus the taste is creamier than kefir typically is kefir is usually in yogurt form kefir’s strong point is that it fills your digestive system with beneficial bacteria which will outcompete disease causing ones whichever you choose to consume you are making a healthy choice alice hess even plain kefir has quite a bit of sugar in it so drinking too much will load up the carbs susan it does that’s news to me i understood that the bacteria grains feasted on the lactose sugar thus turning the milk into a low sugarcarb beverage am i wrong i drink kefir three times daily with no weight gain maybe i’m just lucky that it works for me gaby if you use homemade kefir it is better than the one you buy as you can leave away the sugar kimberly lohr httpsmyoutubecomwatchvurnemvgshs andre dr perlmutter whats your take on yacón  peruvian ground apple it has an extremely high amount of fos and some documented benefits   fos  glucose  fructose  sucrose  yet there is quite some fructose and sucrose in it – screw the carbs and use it as a prebiotic paula coulter i saw dr perlmutter on the dr oz show he suggested putting yogurt in milk and letting it sit overnight to see if there was a yeasty reaction i did this with fage yogurt total failure can you please recommend a yogurt instead of putting all on the market to the test deborah roberts did you get an answer to the yogurt question jay hi paula i make yogurt at home you can choose the type of milk or full fat you need to warm the milk in a pan till it almost boils over then let it cool till about the temperature your finger feels comfortably hot when you dip it in then add yogurt of your choice at least  tablespoons and stir it in the yogurt you choose could be the one you like without flavorings i used a yogurt culture from india these are available as dahi in the indian stores then cover and leave in a warm place you could put in the oven with just the pilot light on in the winter it should set overnight hope this helps regards jay steve how can i eat these foods without irritating ulcers jay they fix your ulcers – which i doubt you have anyway…doctors are not the brightest individuals susan ford keller where can i find coconut

you don’t mention that one  also what do you say to the claim of certain manufacturers of probiotics that only their enteric coated products will resist stomach acids joe rockman my uncle is a cancer researcher and he told me years ago that they discovered a correlation between the consumption of pickled foods and gastric and pancreatic cancers a quick search on the internet shows numerous studies that support this httpwwwnaturecombjcjournalvnabsahtml lb there is a difference between preserved foods and pickled food know well what you are talking about before you comment the subject of your link is preserved foods bearhair it’s funny that you would scold the original poster … you clearly didn’t read the article to determine the researchers’ definition of “preserved foods” “the cancer risk tended to increase with increasing consumption of pickled vegetables fermented soy products salted fish and preserved meats all with significant dose–response relationships in particular the effect of pickled vegetables was substantial among the preserved food subgroups” foods preserved in salt whether pickled in brine or otherwise fermented with salt are the subject of the study jerri jones good question and thank you for the clarification on preserved foods vx pickled foods i would not have gotten there was a difference joe rockman i have significant concerns about eating pickled meats and fish httpwwwnaturecombjcjournalvnabsahtml httpwwwaicrorgassetsdocspdfresearchresconlampefermentedfoodspdf is it the large quantity of these pickled meats and vegetables that have many asian populations at risk for various cancers if pickled meats and vegetables are a risk factor for cancer and the above referenced studies indicate a linear relationship between consumption and cancer then wouldn’t it be better not to eat any pickled foods i’d like dr perlmutter himself to comment on this rather than the nonexperts marcia smith johnson i had to go dairy free about  years ago but recently found a yogurt greek pastures that is made from grass fed cows so far i can handle it and boy does it hit the spot yes it has some sugar but high in protein and i’m hoping over all a good food choice thanks dr perlmutter for all you do julie where can i purchase fermented foods and pickled in brine andrea vaughn make yourself some brine easy then pickle ferment away easy inexpensive doing this ourselves good luck there’s lots of fermenting tips out there a paleo site can fix you up evelyn vincent julie cultures for health has the best ingredients for making your own fermented foods steve fyten or you can make them at home very easily basically pack the vegetables in a jar and pour in water and salt to cover them add spices and peppers if you like then wait a few days and they will start to ferment vanessa “bubbies” brand pickles and saurkraut are actually fermented in brine and delicious whole foods carries them as does yes market in the dc area probably other health food stores carry them as well the pickles are so delicious and full of probiotics shawn i tried out this brand some time ago and i can attest to its relative weakness when i started fermenting my own sauerkraut i was surprised at how much more powerful it was i don’t trust store bought fermented foods to be of maximal benefit they are good as an introduction for those who have not eaten probiotic foods for much of their life vanessa really you could tell just by tasting them or how that’s disappointing i read that their dill pickles contain  on this website httpwwwculturedfoodlifecombubbiespicklessauerkrauttheimmunebuilders what do you think the average amount is in home fermented pickles i supplement with  billion a day but i want to get even more ideally from food and i’m not in a place right now to make my own there is also kefir for those who can eat dairy– there’s a brand called evolve that lists a minimum  million units on the label but consumerlab tested the product and found  billion cfus per cup maybe that’s more along the line of homemade fermented food i have never consumed that much in a day but my health still leaves a lot to be desired despite having made some major changes for the last  years so even though i don’t like the taste of kefir i’m going to try it vanessa the saurkraut has less than the dills just  they’re not available in my area but they also have pickled tomatoes with  i think farmer’s markets that sell fermented pickles and other veg are probably potent too but in my area they are so expensive that unfortunately that’s not a good option for me right now shawn i judged based on the much stronger “healing crisis” that occurred when i consumed the homemade sauerkraut i mostly start my sauerkraut without a starter culture so it may be weaker than the  cfus that dr mercola who does use a starter culture found in a  oz serving of his sauerkraut i will say that in my experience it may be necessary to look for natural therapies for some health problems i have been consuming  ounces of homemade sauerkraut in addition to homemade yogurt which again is much stronger than store bought live cultures almost daily for more than three years and it has not cured an annoying health problem that i have i also have noticed that warmer temperatures do as expected result in a much stronger brew i don’t have any idea about fermented pickles i have good reason to believe that the theraputic effect of any fermented food is greatly enhanced by its being chopped up into very small pieces larger surface area if you like pickles try to shred the cumcumber instead of puting it in whole or in large slices i did try homemade kefir and i believe that it is the best choice for someone looking to quickly get rid of their health problems i don’t know that i found it to be very agreeable to my taste but it did have beneficial health effects patricia reynolds i put kefir in my smoothies soups sauces and scrambled eggs just about anything and it tastes great now besides making kefir i put the excess grains in coconut water and i am making coconut kefir which is great m cat dear david perlmutter my sister has had a bad case of diarrhea she has been to the doctor the doctor diagnosed it as travelers diarrhea or dysentery and was prescribed probiotics which she purchased from the doctor a stool sample was taken and only preliminary test have come back she put my sister at ease with her findings but since the diarrhea was ongoing for  days she gave her a antibiotic cipro this was only because my sister said she has to try something anything she has to work before the diarrhea she was already almost entirely gluten free and also low carb she would like a recommendation for her diet because she doesn’t want to eat anything detrimental please help my sister marlena  much love and positive energy to you and yours cat jeff cat you can read the ph miracle by dr robert young you can call his office up and ask them who is certified to do a live cell demo in your area or close to your area to see what is in her body that shouldn’t be toxinsexcess yeastfungusparasitesheavy metals if any and what to eat and stay away from and what supplements to take best of luck jw m cat thank you jeff i am all about alkalinity and since have found out parasites cannot live in an alkaline environment since i posted the water we were using when my mother was in the hospital for broken ankle in corpus christi tx is now having to be boiled for e colithis was immediately befor she got it in her hometown san antonio tx there was a cyclospora outbreak also all test results were negative even on stool sample  were sent in for different test i am very upset now they have put her on antibiotics and i am almost certain that may just worsen her condition thank you for the information  i will definitely check into it ps she had also eaten  boxes of strawberries in a short period of time they were not organic  i know they are on ewg dirty dozen list  i believe thanks again jeff love cat hana dolgin speaking of alkalinity are you familiar with kangen water this is water made by a small medical device from japan now available worldwide it filters the tap water and then splits it into alkaline and acid water the alkaline water is also antioxidant and is absorbed better than

kill ecoli salmonella and most bacteria viruses and fungus there is another water it makes that can dissolve and remove oilbased pesticides these machines do so much for people’s health they are definitely worth looking into if you want to understand the difference between water that is alkalized through adding minerals what you may call natural and water that is alkalized by electrolysis like kangen water please watch dr michael donaldson explain this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtmubyipzq hana dolgin kangen water is not just alkaline it is antioxidant and also has a higher absorption rate

have protien drink with avocados  spinach blueberries and coconut water  for my mid day meal drink  liters of this water a day almost no sugar and do have  piece of gluten free toast in the am with eggs scrambled with spinach you really don’t miss the other grains i do chicken in a crockpot with olive oil then in salads would like suggestions on more probiotics i take vsl pro  and two by schiff i am lactose intolerant i agree with you on the controversy with the machine some people that had them in calif actually developed a bacterial infection as they said the filters were leaking the high ph has worked great for me i am reading brain maker now great read dr perlmutter do you still have a practice in naples hana dolgin i would be happy to explain anything you found on the internet we have plenty of science about our water hana dolgin we have units starting from  and they can be financed patricia reynolds as i said above i use an alkalizing stick from healthy habits which l place in a two quart container of water for five minutes i use this primarily in my juices we have found it is better to use alkaline water sparely as you can over do it hana dolgin i wanted to let you know that most kangen water machines make a disinfectant nontoxic water that can kill ecoli salmonella and other bacteria viruses and fungi so it can be applied to fruits and vegetables to prevent food poisoning there is another water that can dissolve oilbased pesticides which are toxic many people are ingesting them since they don’t come off with regular water this is in addition to the healthiest alkaline antioxidant and superhydrating drinking water and a skin care water called “beauty water” i would be glad to answer any questions you may have if you would like more information

think are really important and i post frequently about them this is not a signal of any kind or proprietary interest only a keen “getthewordout” interest i’m glad hana keeps posting about kangen water zollistar i notice in subsequent posts that hana works for the company that’s okay by me so long as she let’s us know this — and she did anita smith are dates allowable on the grain brain diet i can find no mention of them at all and i love them as a natural sweetener in my breakfast muesli elsie muesli grains have you read the book a couple of dates ok but highly glycemic bj dr perlmutter i am struggling right now with my diet i have adhesions from numerous surgerieslong sad story that have caused two bowel obstructions how can i get most beneficial fiber on low fiber diet i have always eaten the most healthy way as you suggest but now i am having to be careful to avoid anymore obstructions help i really miss eating healthy maya lebow try going to the institute for functional medicine website and find a functional medicine practitioner to help you the ideal clinic has a doctor and nutritionists on site hope you feel better david perlmutter here’s the tool for that bj httpswwwfunctionalmedicineorgpractitionersearchaspxid vanessa hi dr perlmutter and bj i am wondering if you also have trouble absorbingdigesting fat and protein because of your intestine surgery i have had a great deal of intestine removed and also have adhesions and have trouble with those things plus fiber so i am having quite a hard time trying to eat a paleogapsketogenic diet even though that is probably best for my major depressive disorder and other autoimmune disorders trouble like  liquid stoolsday which is better than an obstruction but is painful and i’m eating all this good food supplements but not absorbing it 🙁 charlas custom probiotics can usually turn this around httpwwwcustomprobioticscomcustomprobioticsstrainhtm hana dolgin one thing that could help is proper hydration with kangen water many people find that it helps them eliminate properly without strain even if you eat a healthy diet without adequate hydration you are likely to be somewhat constipated see httpwwwdrinkfreshkangencom for more information i would be glad to explain more to you about this amazing medical device from japan that is now available worldwide it hooks up to your faucet and electric outlet and after filtering the water it splits it into alkaline and acid ph levels the water has a higher absorption and is antioxidant so it reduces inflammation in the body feel free to contact me through the website jay my wife had can  bowel resections adhesion problems cancer treatmentradiation to the intestinal area she has made significant improvement following the fodmaps diet over the course of a year slow but steady progress the major carbs and “staples” she eats are jasmine rice some russet potatoes strawberries several times a day zucchini and yellow squash spinach eggs rice chex cereal almond butter fishchickenturkey swisssharp cheese heavy cream potatoe crackers pure maple syrupcandy for a treat no artificial sugars corn starches sucrose pasta breads… only soda with natural sugar hana dolgin soda is extremely acidic even if it has natural sugar as a matter of fact even sparkling mineral waters like perrier and pellegrino are extremely acidic and can cause serious health problems see tests demonstrating what i said here at httpwwwkangendemocom cancer cells have been shown to thrive in acidic ph – low oxygen environments when something has an acidic ph it is lower in oxygen than what has an alkaline ph so by ingesting acidic ph food and drink one is making their body more prone to cancer and other diseases check out kangen water which you can make in the comfort of your home httpwwwdrinkfreshkangencom t i follow this diet exactly i feel great but my ldl cholesterol is significantly higher than before i started the diet… this makes me question this entire book because i did my own personal case study for about a year… be careful m lebow phd we should all be careful in the sense that we need to do personal diagnostic tests before taking supplements and following diets everything is bad in excess and each of us has no idea what is our personal excess or what is causing our personal depletions while i may think i need magnesium for migraines if i really have enough then excess can cause heart problems what is excess is also tricky the more direct blood tests like checking mg are not the most accurate you need to check mg in red blood cells for a accurate measure good luck but dont give up just because this diet didn’t work for you you are special i recommend dr hyman’s website for more answers he also gives lists of tests that a doctor should check i think for cholesterol particles size matters if your particles of cholesterol are small than the numbers do not matter david perlmutter an important point know your body tina t dc i’m confused about the ldl levels in grain brain you talk about people with the highest levels of ldl having a reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases so does that mean the diet is actually working for “t” above honeyj i have went to quest labs  times and had blood drawn to have my particle size testedthey either receive the blood to late or don’t have record of it being sent to lipo science i am frustrated and don’t know where to go and have this done i really need to have this done as my ldl is rising any suggestions would be appreciated kathy for the last  years my blood sugar levels were high after doing the grain brain diet for  weeks my glucose level dropped  points and is now in the normal range i lost  lbs and about the same in inches i decreased  size already and have no bloating in my stomach and finally i am sleeping through the night question – the ketone strips are always in the negative or pink range does that mean i need to continue to lower my carbs

so very much however while i listen on audiblecom want to be able to access a hard copy for recipes etc somehow and seems kindle is not an option so is there a way to actually do this to get me hands on a hard copy many thanks disquspjwdsembvz i want to gain lbs i now weighs  lbs norbert uncas i am a little confused about prebiotic volume requirements you say we should get a minimum of g of soluble fiber per day i think i heard you indicate that a primal person might get up to g per day frankly i cannot manage to do it with raw and cooked vegetables and without fruit and lentils it seems to me it would be almost impossible using the foods you suggest in brain maker one cup of raw onion has less than g and that is one of the highest concentrations of soluble fiber i can find how much soluble fiber is in a cup of dandelion greens i’m just having trouble reaching g per day with cooked and raw vegetables bearhair acacia gum perhaps zzzzzzzzzz you say for the prebiotic foods most are raw how are u suppose to eat them raw doesnt really explain can you cook them and have nearly the same prebiotic effects bearhair dr perlmutter explains above in the post how he includes them in his diet in salads fermented in kimchi etc robin malik hi dr perlmutter i have been diagnosed with about  food allergies i have also had a elevated ige and eos count with the food elimination for several months now i still have this elevation i am also very reactive to dampness — i break out in hives do you believe the ige and eos related to the allergies or is there something else causing these elevations thank you robin suzanne kinney when yogurt is used in recipes does it retain the active cultures or does the heat of cooking kill them trudi trahanupchan i don’t see okra on any list – but i lost my memory for  years – raw okra restored my brain’s ability to retain information and relearn how to write and the meaning of words it does not cure my parkinsonism disease but does help to

fermented foods jenny lin hi dr perlmutter many of the foods you listed were raw do the prebiotic benefits disappear if i consume them cooked thanks rick did you drop your endorsement of protandimrick david perlmutter i no longer have a relationship with protandim healthyeater hi dr perlmutter thank you for your helpful books we switched to carbfree eating   months ago we aim for  meaning that we try to keep carb consumption to  percent or less of our weekly diet we have rid our home of bread grains legumes pasta fruit and so on i have joint hypermobility syndrome which causes among other issues irritable bowel i have always been able to control my ibs with diet however since beginning no carbs i struggle each day after the first meal with painful cramps and diarrhea i used to have oatmeal made with milk or a bagel for breakfast i thought my gut would adjust after a few carbfree weeks but it hasn’t i would love to know what is setting off my ibs and how to get back to normal i have had a little success with having just a little plain greek yogurt i’m seriously considering having gluten free toast to get back to painfree mornings thank you for any input you may have carrie i don’t know what you are eating but there are certain foods that can aggravate a compromised gut even after excluding the major offenders look up fodmaps diet it can pinpoint other foods to look for as potential offenders personally i can only tolerate a few nuts and never on an empty stomach coconut in excess also gives me cramps some people are intolerant to eggs too good luck healthyeater very thoughtful of you to offer the info although the issue is the effect withdrawal of carbs appears to be having no fodmaps or lactose in use but again thank you lone wolf let food be our medicine avoid any supplement and also special diet which often is not well fit for certain people changing our diet too rapidly cause often problem because the body cannot adopt it fast enough changing our diet must be done very slowly every one’s body functions differently so we cannot do a special diet which works for someone else we must find ourselves what kind of food suits our body by trying slowly no one can understand our body better than ourselves so we must find out what kind of food is good for us by our selves pay attention to our body and be patient a quick cure will not last for a long time there is no perfect health we are either heading for illness or health to be healthy we must walk toward health every day until the last day we must not forget “food is medicine” even very healthy food can cause health problems when we overeat hana dolgin i would like to add that hydration with the right water is imperative for health our body is about  water so it only makes sense i recommend looking into kangen water it is alkaline antioxidant and higher absorption water that is made by a device that you connect to your faucet and outlet it filters the water and then using electrolysis splits it into different ph levels with different properties please visit httpwwwdrinkfreshkangencom charlas some of the best electrolytes i have found is concentrace trace minersls liquid i’ve used it for years it is an incredible electrolyte replacer also restores mineral balance in the body if used regularly httpwwwtracemineralscomproductsliquidtabletmineralsconcentraceionicminerals cathryn potvin i have heard a lot of people say kangen water isn’t a healthy way to go it’s abnormally high in ph people can have a proper ph with dietminerals etc hana dolgin that is incorrect kangen water will not disrupt your body’s ph balance watch dr michael donaldson explain the difference between water made alkaline through the addition of minerals and kangen water httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtmubyipzq i can tell you that i have been drinking kangen water for over  years and have had nothing but benefits from it you would think that if what you are saying is correct the negative effects would have shown up by now also these devices have been approved for medical use in japan for over  years and are used in hospitals there they would have found out there is a problem don’t you think watch this video from japanese tv about kangen water httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxxpcqmmymots for more information check out my website httpwwwdrinkfreshkangencom healthyeater you know what you are right after more than three months of a disturbed digestive system today i bought glutenfree bread for morning toasting and  hopefully finally – a tool for adjusting to eating carbfree for the rest of the day thank you for the downtoearth advice karen parrish can u give a list like u did in the other one what is gluten free and good for u and the brain like a shpping list” carolannd i had it too and i found that staying away from things like dairy products and a real good dose of daily vitamin d helped to the degree that i don’t get it anymore at all thank god i started off with about  iu of d and slowly worked my way up to  iu i recommend it highly much success to you you definitely have my sympathies i suffered with it for years so happy not to anymore carolannd

husband and i have followed the diet and supplements recommended in ‘grain brain’ for several months now do you recommend continuing with them and adding more probiotics as suggested in ‘brian maker’ or some other plan thank you for your response david perlmutter specific to yourself kathy i cannot advise a plan however i do think it is great to use the supplements i suggest in grain brain and accompany those with more fermented food options mike chisman david with the all too many choices of olive oils what are some brands you’ve found that are really  olive oil i’m taking advantage of

httpswwwfunctionalmedicineorgpractitionersearchaspxid karenrg drdanharpercom in the san diego area may be able to help he is very very bright eileen loughney why is it so difficult to find fermented pickles in the market place where do i look every brand of pickle not he shelf is made with vinegar ideas vanessa i discovered bubbies brand pickles they make saurkraut as well they are fermented using brine and full of probiotics whole foods carries them as well as a health food chain in the dc area yes market just in case you’re in the area the pickles are delicious if there is a farmer’s market in your area there might be a vendor of fermented pickles there too in my area the farmre’s market isn’t year round so i’m glad bubbies exists jane i discovered krakus brand “cucumbers in brine” on the international aisle at wegmans they’re from poland the only ingredients are cucumbers salt and water sedary just a heads up all of the above mentioned foods which are fermented are very high in histamine especially the fermented fish which can tip one over into histamine intolerance and even an anaphylactic reaction histamine overload can cause even worse inflammation along with very scary symptoms including dizziness migraines and even a great risk of stroke this is a very short list there are more i think perhaps following an antihistamine diet would be far better overall i truly think it would be better to eat the fresh foods listed and be selective to focus on other nutrient dense fresh foods also anything labeled “yogurt” by law has to contain two probiotic strains which were first used to ferment milk at the pasteur institute during the th century both of those strains really don’t flourish until the mixture is well above body temperature and into the  to  degrees f range how those can help in the human gut is a puzzle some companies now add other strains which are indeed helpful there are some known and isolated probiotics strains now which do reside in the gut of healthy humans such as l infantis l rhamnosus l gasseri and b longum etc which have antihistamine properties b bifidus causes a histamine response but of course anything with only those cannot legally be labeled yogurt such product would still cause a histamine reaction if one is sensitive to such bearhair for those interested the two original strains to which the original poster coyly referred are lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus susana hi dr permutter how are you do you have any recipes in how to make fermented jalapeño peppers the fermeneteed guacamole and spicy salsa oh and is miso ssafe to consume thanks susana carla has anyone made the ferments in the book i was just wondering if there is anything else to use beside water in a plastic bag to anchor the ferments down because i feel odd about putting plastic into a fermentation jar thank you karenrg if you make saurkraut use some cabbage leaves in the top to force the mixture under the liquid elizabeth lavet youtube has many videos about fermenting vegetables there are now more sites that sell ferment jars and weights try amazon for a variety evalynne engle i use fido jars look up fido fermentation on the web — lots of information it’s so easy  i’ve only had mold on one occasion in  or  years kayla lindsay i am looking for something with a lot of protein because my muscle is developing and i want to be sure i choose the right thing however i have a sensitive gagging reflex and textile sensitivity what do i do or what do you suggest ptolemy just finished reading brain maker and i have to say a very big thank you for writing such an uptodate relevant and accessible book i have early stage parkinson’s and i’ve been prescribed azilect rasagiliene and have been taking a low dose antibiotic for years for an unrelated condition well maybe not ‘unrelated’ after reading your book i’ve been reading that people taking azilect should avoid eating fermented or pickled foods because these foods are tyraminerich but a significant proportion my diet consists of these foods and of course they’re recommended in your book is the azilect – fermented food ‘clash’ a ‘real’ issue if so should i avoid such foods or try to be prescribed a different drug my goal after reading your book is to ditch the medication completely but that is a longer discussion i need to have with my specialist thank you for your dedication and time cherylmac i would encourage anyone who is consuming plenty of natural probiotic foods and still having trouble or getting worse with brain fog depression skin rashes or flushing tooth sensitivity weight gain inflammation lethargy burning eyes swollen extremities etc to consider how many probiotic strains there are and that each strain has a specific job it does as well as reaction it causes in your body eliminating all grain from my diet caused me to do a degree turn healthwise over the years however i was encouraged to consume more and more natural sources of probiotics and even did some indepth study and began to ferment my own foods including sauerkraut pickled veggies kombucha etc here i thought i was doing something good for my health and my gut but as soon as i added in homemade sauerkraut and kombucha over the course of  months my health plummeted until i had gained  lbs became so depressed i was barely functioning i was lethargic most of the time my hands and feet were swollen going to bed with burning eyes waking up with swollen eyes filled with eye boogers i had horribly inflamed cystic acne all over my back shoulders and chest and even my teeth became extremely sensitive to cold and heat i then came across some information i read about histamine intolerance this revealed that most natural and homemade probiotic foods contain an enormous amount of histamineproducing strains of bacteria some of these histamineproducing strains are even found in packaged probiotic capsules i immediately discontinued all probiotic sources and for a few days ate only foods on the “low histamine” list… and every single symptom greatly improved i lost  lbs immediately was less hungry acne started clearing up inflammation disappeared and for those couple days i had so much energy i couldn’t even contain myself and went on cleaning sprees throughout the house everything i had been putting off due to depression for months i would also urge dr perlmutter to please look into the various strains of bacteria and the effects that each has on health or disease had i continued with sauerkraut pickled foods and kombucha who knows how ill i would be right now lisa i would be interested to hearlearn more about this and what dr p thinks kate i have been fermenting my own foods as well and discovered that you can significantly reduce histamines in fermented foods by fermenting anaerobically as opposed to aerobic fermenting and by fermenting longer in other words use an airlock system and let the fermentation process go full cycle histamine levels are directly related to the age of the ferment most people only ferment for  to  days thus also prevents contamination by any of the undesirable air born molds since i switched to anaerobic method and extended my fermentation period  to  days depending on the foods used i have no mold issues or histamine reactions i’m also using airlock systems for my kefirs to avoid mold contamination in warmer months but do not extend the fermentation time plenty of info on the web about this blondejustice how do you ferment anaerobically what do you need where can i get the “airlock system” you mentioned in your post h do cooked versions of the prebiotic foods you’ve listed above contain benefits too or only when raw arya jemal is being vegan with

i have one caution for women and the use of chicory root it can cause shedding of the uterine line to increase in fact it was used in the old days in high doses to abort an unwanted pregnancy i used to eat a breakfast cereal that contained chicory i developed endometriosis and had a hysterectomy then i had a friend who started bleeding almost  weeks a month she offered me a fiber one bar which has chicory in it i read the labels though because i’m allergic to soy she said that they were giving her gas – i asked her how many she ate a day and how long she’d been eating them she’d been eating them for about  months — and her excessive bleeding had been going on for about  i had a funny feeling and so i googled the effects of chicory and up came all these articles about miscarriages i showed them to her she stopped eating the chicory bars which are sold in cases at costco but then here’s the real kicker later that week i went a bible study and there was a young woman there– about  who asked us to pray about her having a baby – they’d been trying for  years i asked her if by chance she ate fiber one bars — and she said that she did — every day i told her about the chicory articles — and the next time i saw her at a retreat  months later she was pregnant she said she got pregnant the very next month after stopping i’ve met two other women who were having excessive bleeding and they both ate those fiber one — or other fiber bars with chicory so while it may be safe for men women take note and if you start having ultraheavy periods or if you’re trying to have a baby – beware save yourself from the heartache of a lost baby or feeling barren when you can simply drop the chicory bars what’s really sad is that pregnant women may be eating them for the extra fiber milos pet is coffee fruit extract the same as green coffee bean extract pill or liquid form anyone found a good product clare farrell in brainmaker on page  you list that on
