of tough new legislation that would give the food and drug administration the authority to test ingredients used in cosmetics and issue mandatory recalls for products found to be unsafethe fight has

advertisement continue reading the main story “if you are in business and are not involved in politics then politics will run your business” explained a presentation prepared by mary kay last summer

discovery of hair products and skin creams containing hazardous ingredients such as formaldehyde and mercury photo chaz dean at a holiday party he hosted in los angeles in december more than  complaints have been lodged against his wen hair products credit araya diazgetty images “people don’t realize there is effectively no regulation of cosmetics” said representative frank pallone jr democrat of new jersey he along with ms feinstein and ms collins has pushed to strengthen a  law that was passed to regulate the pharmaceutical industry but contained two pages that addressed cosmetics leaving it essentially unregulatedjoe hixson a spokesman for guthyrenker the distributor of wen said the company has “evidence and studies that we believe demonstrate wen is safe and does not cause hair loss”mr dean’s hair care product does not actually lather instead mr dean promotes it as “a revolutionary way to cleanse” the hair without the use of traditional detergents or sulfates chemicals some consumers have objected to“in addition to it sounding like ‘zen’ the system is a completely reverse way of looking at cleansing the hair” the product’s website boasts “thus ‘wen’ is ‘new’ spelled backwards” the company also sells what it calls “unique formulations gentle for pediatric use”miriam lawrence of denver said she used wen’s sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner on the hair of her daughter eliana then  about three times in late  within days her daughter’s brush was full of hair three weeks later eliana was bald advertisement continue reading the main story “it changed our life in just a couple shampoos it’s ridiculous” said ms lawrence whose daughter has grown back most of her hair and eyebrows “it was marketed to be extra gentle no harsh chemicals”mr pallone in a letter to the fda and guthyrenker has pressed for answers about the wen case and in an interview he cited it as an example of why current law is failing and more rigorous regulation is neededfor legal reasons the government’s hands are tiedthat is in part because unlike pharmaceutical companies cosmetic companies are not required to notify the government of “adverse reaction” reports — even if someone dies photo wen’s sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner which miriam lawrence used on the hair of her daughter eliana credit nick cote for the new york times the fda instead has had to depend on consumers stepping forward and as of july  only  reports had been filed to the agency detailing problems with the wen hair care line but inspectors sent to the company’s facilities dating back to  learned that complaints to the company and distributor total more than  the agency said last month“you know how the stars were saying it was so good and it made your hair more manageable more shinier” said bonnie iqbal  of albany who last year was among those who sued the company after her hair began falling out “so i figured you know i’d try it”patricia j zettler a health law and policy expert at georgia state university and a former fda lawyer said that under existing law the agency could take action against the company only if it could prove a product had been mislabeled or contaminated if the product turns out to be dangerous but legal the government has no recourse“the bottom line is if the company has not violated the law there isn’t really anything fda can do” ms zettler saideven in the absence of federal action guthyrenker in a “business decision” agreed in late june to a  million legal settlement — still not approved by a federal court judge — that would repay up to  to every person who has bought a bottle since wen products were introduced and as much as  to individuals claiming hair loss or other injury yet the product is still being sold

advertisement continue reading the main story the bill would collect about  million in fees annually from beauty care companies to help cover the cost of confirming the safety of about five ingredients each year that are suspected of causing problems such as lead acetate a color additive in hair dyes and quaternium a preservative used in certain shampoo and cosmeticsthe legislation has won the endorsement of heavyweights including estée lauder whose brands include clinique origins mac la mer and bobbi brown johnson  johnson maker of neutrogena and aveeno and procter  gamble whose brands include pantene head  shoulders herbal essences and olay industry officials said they decided to embrace the legislation after becoming increasingly concerned that a decline in consumer confidence could hurt their sales photo photographs showed the progress of eliana’s hair loss in late  credit nick cote for the new york times “the feinsteincollins bill is supported by a vast and diverse group of people and groups who all want the same thing — cosmetic regulations that best serve the public health and give consumers confidence in the products and ingredients they choose for their families” darrel jodrey a top federal lobbyist at johnson  johnson said in a statementmajor national environmental consumer and health nonprofits such as the american cancer society the environmental working group and the good housekeeping institute have also backed the planbut even before ms feinstein formally introduced her legislation in april  the independent cosmetic manufacturers and distributors in which guthyrenker has been a duespaying member for over a decade moved to defeat it internal documents obtained by the times showduring a march  strategy session in the new york law offices of a trade association legal adviser locke lord industry executives were briefed by their lobbying team who explained that it had already approached the office of representative fred upton of michigan the chairman of the house energy and commerce committee with jurisdiction over the fdamichael lunceford a senior vice president at mary kay overseeing the company’s lobbying and public affairs divisions had done groundwork through the direct selling association where he is on the board to help mr upton’s  reelection effort the organization bought billboard radio and newspaper ads “to gain the attention of the candidate in order to cultivate a champion for the direct selling industry” according to an industry newsletterguthyrenker hired its own wellconnected washington help william r nordwind a lawyer and lobbyist who spent a dozen years working as a staff member and campaign aide to mr upton mr hixson the guthyrenker spokesman said the

who lobbies for the independent cosmetic manufacturers and distributors said regarding guthyrenker and its wen product line “they don’t want to be the face of the industry for having done this”mary kay claims credit for persuading mr sessions whose dallasarea district is near its headquarters to sponsor alternative legislation mr sessions’s proposal still would require beauty care companies to notify the fda of “serious cosmetic adverse events” but it would not grant the agency the power to order a recall or collect industry fees to pay for new programs such as the safety evaluation of cosmetics ingredients most important for direct sellers like guthyrenker mary kay and other members of the independent cosmetics group it would broadly and retroactively preempt any tougher state laws photo bonnie iqbal  of albany used wen’s products and sued after her hair started falling out credit nathaniel brooks for the new york times “we can’t just be out there saying ‘no we don’t like feinstein’s bill’” mr harmala said in an interviewmr sessions after introducing the legislation became a favorite of the cosmetics industry campaign finance records show emerging as the top recipient in congress of donations from mary kay employees and taking donations from at least  other industry executives including pam busiek the president of the independent cosmetic manufacturers and distributors executives at guthyrenker were not among the donorsmore industry donations were sent to representatives eddie bernice johnson democrat of texas and bill flores republican of texas the only other two house lawmakers to help sponsor the billcrayton w webb a spokesman for mary kay said the company was committed to helping pass a law that increased the federal government’s oversight of the industry but opposed ms feinstein’s bill because “it falls short in providing one clear national and uniform safety standard”ms busiek added “we want something that is not overreaching” mr dean declined to commentthe fda would not comment on the proposals so far the agency said it has found no evidence of contamination or misbranding in wen products the only two product flaws it can use to press a company to agree to a voluntary recall the agency has requested the results of safety tests and other manufacturing data but it cannot compel the company to release any information“that’s why it is so critical that we get information directly from consumers and their health care providers” said susan mayne the director of the fda’s center for food safety and applied nutrition for consumers dealing with thinning hair itchy scalps and other problems the additional responsibility of bringing their case to the government can be a tall order — and certainly a confusing one the government should be helping them they say advertisement continue reading the main story “i think it would be great for the fda to step in a little bit more” said melanie guitzkow a yearold student who said her

you might think of it as a land of drugpushing crimecommitting illegals aiming to upset all americans hold dear well it turns out mexico is a market not only for american goods of many kinds but also for journalism this election season it is refreshing to see mexico and latin america in the news as something more than a piñata for illtempered politicians net immigration is now back to mexico from the us says pew research today the new york times nysenyt does that newsmaking launching an effort a year in the making simply titled the new york times en español  based in mexico city and reaching out to all of spanishspeaking latin america  the times initial effort is a modest one but one intended both to be built out and to be used as a model for the times in other parts of the world its nyts intention to launch a second region in  as well so as the year begins we can see the times is clearly back in the new product game with international expansion just part of the game plan  the rest tba the potential audience is a big one  estimated by the times at  million including those who combine certain education and income levels with digital savvy thats out of about  million spanish speakers worldwide primarily in latin america and spain while english is the de facto lingua franca worldwide with  billion able to understand it spanish is not far behind nyts immediate goal get a little piece of that market to pay for a digital subscription but it launches as a free product  no meter no paywall just ads from four launch sponsors i want to stress that ultimately this is about a subscription model stephen dunbarjohnson the times international president told me friday thats consistent with what ceo mark thompson laid out in his fiveyear plan reader revenue  now running at  percent of total revenue  is the lead dog going forward readers like you and me are far more loyal to the times than are advertisers as the worlds of advertising continue to experience one upheaval after another just one example from last weeks times q financial report its print revenue month by month in that quarter was  percent  percent and  percent further the times is still on a digital subscription roll it can claim almost  million digitalonly subscribers up  percent year over year and a net gain of  subscribers in the last quarter thompson said thursday that the times believes it will hit  million by the end of  of that number perhaps nyt en español will contribute somewhere in the five figures  at some point the times now has sold more than  digitalonly subscriptions  percent of its overall total to those living outside the us the times wont break out that geography but we can safely assume the great bulk are subscribers in europe and canada whatever the times can eke out of its new market in   if it launches any metered paywall system by then  will be just a down payment on  plans we do not plan on having a pay system in  says dunbarjohnson we have a lot to learn from our latin american readers and we need to understand their needs and preferences as we do and over time we will find the solutions to best engage them and in turn develop a subscription relationship all to say this is a longterm audience development roadin markets where we have yet to achieve significant penetration we are focusing first on audience growth supported by advertising the times hopes to cook up a new audience says dunbarjohnson we want to take a bet on exposing larger numbers of people in this market in spanish to new york times journalism have them marinate in the brand learning from the  times paid experiments in his comments you can hear the lessons of  at the times that spring it announced plans for three subscription paid products the millennialoriented lowerpriced nyt now launched but couldnt land more than  subscribers it remains today as a free product and a good learning lab for the times nyt opinion launched but it became immediately apparent that it too wouldnt find much of an additional paying market it was closed within six months nyt cooking lives on popular with readers but relying only on ads the times having decided against putting in a metered pay system given what it had learned those echoes of product testing informed much of the times new product development work of  so with the new products  and nyt en español will be only the first to launch this year details to come  the model is develop the audience first charge later the relative modesty of todays launch is a contrast to earlier efforts those  launches were costly as has been its foray in china in this case we see a total cost of probably  million or so to build out the first inlanguage regional product given though the newly builtout central team  which will lead development in the other nonus regions  the marginal cost of new regions should come at less than  million each that incremental cost will be driven by the size and experience of editorial staff needed to create a winning product we can see another reason for the times caution here expanding outside a publishers home market is anything but easy were introducing the times to a new group of people says paul walborsky the business head of the times new international product efforts and of nyt en español walborsky who serves as a strategic consultant to the times brings unusual experience to the company he is an entrepreneur steeped in publishing with broad and fundamental knowledge of latin america he was born and raised in mexico city leaving at age  but has kept up connections in

spanishspeaking city the intention is to serve everyone in latin america save those portuguesespeaking brazilians who actually slightly outnumber all the continents spanish speakers reader research showed a high interest in a timescurated news product that research has been multifaceted including street intercepts of wouldbe readers use of facebook as a platform and even sending out test newsletter products importantly the times initial product team includes one data scientist and one person dedicating to user design research testimony to how important the new research and analytics are to contemporary product development its a new circle of knowledge as walborsky describes it market research user design research and then we validate with data science he uses the word narrowcasting by using fairly advanced data science we can actually get to the right audience and get them engaged at the end of the day you cant just spend money because you cant translate everything and you cannot produce  pieces you really need to narrowcast or narrowtarget your content to the right audience engagement is the key now its out of the data and into the marketplace importantly in this case it isnt the top of the proverbial audience funnel thats most important its the middle  those that can be regularly engaged in times content says polgreen our goal is to skip the mass audience step if we get  million people coming to this website that will be great but i think our real target is to try and go out there to find who are the most engaged users who we think are going to want to come to use a couple of times a week or every day and really have a deeply engaged relationship with the new york times consequently how many stories people read is one test here id believe that paying subscribers would one day expect many more but thats a decision for down the road in offering a onceaweek newsletter boletin at launch the times applies a lesson from the mothership email newsletters briefings and alerts all increase engagement and the times is engaging more resources to work each format by spring boletin is planned to go to five days a week nyt en español is browseronly no app is planned at this point it looks much like the rest of the times site ultimately the desired engagement may depend as much on the intangible of product feel as its content thats a question of la voz the voice of this product that the times hopes to make a friendly and comfortable daily companion of the most engaged and eventually paying readers the halfdozen editorial staffers are matched up with an equal number of those directing and aiding the product including product manager data scientist user design researcher and developer we can expect the times to launch a variety of marketing programs over the year i asked whether it has been able to secure any launch help from one of its major investors carlos slim who owns  percent of the times after making a major investment in the depths of the great recession slim edged out by  billion by bill gates for the no  spot on forbes wealth list owns américa móvil nyseamx the largest mobile carrier in latin america i wondered if slim could help the times with product placement or preferences in ways similar to those that samsung otcssnlf has done with axel springer as the german media company launches its mobile news aggregator product upday no says polgreen as you know carlos slim is an investor in the times just like any other hes not involved in the project in any way four launch sponsors defray the investment while subscription may be the longerterm goal here for now its advertising that will help defray the cost of the person investment the times is making the new york times en español launches with four initial threemonth sponsors a good representation interestingly theyre a mix of us advertisers wanting to reach a broader market and latin americanbased corporations if you look at latin america you certainly have a pool of potential advertisers of those that are panlatin says dunbarjohnson these are companies that are multinationals that have significant interest in latin america there are a reasonable number of those those sponsors include a financial giant mexicos banamex formula  gran premio de mexico  and acciona otcacxiy a large spanish renewable energy company the times begins this initiative with no staffed advertising sales offices in the region it has long had new york times syndicate sales staff there but it does have an agent in mexico city and plans to build out its own sales staff as the audience grows will the times t brand studio its big digitalad growth engine be spinning out branded content ads in the new product not yet but its talent could kick in as the audience grows to scale as it enters the new marketplace theres lot of competition primary of course is the contest for readers time then there are other publishers latin american media revived itself after the dark years of dictatorship and censorship that marked much of the s and s mostly familyowned the incountry press has more lately suffered from the same kinds of digital disruption that have affected north america and europe their depth of nonnational reporting varies and only a few have any original global staffing wed also have to consider el país the madridbased daily with extensive operations in latin america bbc mundo cnn en español and the wall street journal as competition both the times the newsonomics of the new york times expanding global strategy and the journal have had their share of stumbles abroad the times abandoned a brazil edition when it ran into headwinds three years ago even as the guardian quartz buzzfeed and the huffington post build and plan sites far afield its clear not all of them will succeed as both bloomberg and the financial times both more highly experienced in global publishing have found its a long slog of building ad relationships relevance and readership the times investment here then can be seen as a relatively small one that can be sustained and allowed time to find traction thats the hope anyway for a new

between the boston globe and the new york times co nysenyt seems ready to continue on to another round the new york times co which owns the boston globe has been trying to trim  million dollars in cost reductions in order to minimize their losses it has been reported that last year the globe lost  million dollars and that this year they are expected to lose about  million dollars with the globe expected to lose money it should not come as a surprise that severe cuts might have to take place in order to save the globe the labor unions aren’t making this simple though in order to achieve their goal the new york times recently proposed a package of benefit and wage cuts the unions responded with a flat out rejection and the new york times now finds itself implementing a  salary cut for all employees across the board the unions really should have accepted the package it’s understandable that the unions opposed any sort of cuts who likes to have their salary reduced no one but surely the package they were offered must have been better than the  salary cut they’re now facing the new york times is now quietly looking for buyers and is ready to sell the globe because honestly there is only so much you can do for a company that is no longer making you money nor willing to compromise and meet you half way goldman sachs nysegs is soliciting interest in a potential sale and is said to have a couple of parties who are interested the unions may now have to deal with a new owner who is more than willing to start dismissing people or if no one buys the globe then the new york times won’t have any other choice but to close it however the real question is “who wants to buy a newspaper” newspapers are no longer profitable and many have already thrown in the towel the internet is largely to blame because information is now so readily available with a simple click of the mouse take this article for example you didn’t pay to read it and you did it within the comfort of your own home or office without ever taking a step out newspaper advertisements have declined drastically and profits are no longer what they once were any company that decides to buy the globe would be committing financial suicide because the globe really is nothing more than a financial burden online media is now the king of information and newspapers can do nothing about it so please if you’re

nast ad age and people a new class of sociallydriven ad inventory by jason del rey published on march   soon a host of publishers will follow the new york times co and allow advertisers to buy specific articles as they are distributed on social networks the times launched the product called richochet last april to let advertisers choose specific articles from a publishers archive to bind their ads to for a certain duration the technology then creates a unique url for the selected articles which the advertisers can distribute to their social networks the idea is to give brands using ricochet an incentive to distribute articles in social media and to give publishers a means to earn additional revenue michael zimbalist starting in may a host of outside publishersincluding ad age conde nast and time incs peoplewill begin using the technology and sharing revenue with the times making it the first product from the times rd ventures group to be made available to other publishers related stories new york times rd group launches first commercial product and its for brands this is an entirely new concept in digital marketing that creates a whole new class of inventory sociallydriven inventory michael zimbalist vpresearch and development operations at the times co said at back in april up to now advertisers have been able to only access content from nytimescom bostoncom and bostonglobecom  all owned by the new york times company for the moment starting may  advertisers will be able to fix their ads to web articles from ad age as well as the new yorker glamour wired and other conde nast titles articles from people will also be available as a part of a time inc pilot for advertisers richochet campaigns will only be as good as their ability to distribute the individual pieces of content on their own  whether to their followings on social networks or through paid channels such as outbrain on the other side the technology seems like a good deal for publishers it essentially helps them get paid to let advertisers distribute their work for them individual publishers set their own prices and share the resulting ad revenue with the times co which wont comment on the specific terms of those deals each publisher also makes their own rules about which pieces of content an advertiser can bind their ads to a publisher could decide for example that advertisers cant tie their ads to articles about themselves or about their competitors ricochet will be a selfserve marketplace for advertisers by may  mr zimbalist said in a brief interview theyll be able to search the content database by topic upload their ad creative choose from different page layouts if a publisher offers them and set the duration of the campaign for now the times co

about those  off sales now that we have your attention are you ready to find out why you shouldnt believe those overhyped advertisements first off those enticing  off  off and  off ads generally refer to discounts off the highestpriced mostrestricted ticket classes refundable etc what the carriers are really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive tickets news flash in most cases theyre providing absolutely no support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances heres the bottom line most leisure travelers never actually buy the costliest mostrestricted tickets those are generally picked up by business travelers shopping on the company dime with lowcost airlines online travel agents and flexible date searches all factoring in to your price hunting its rare that youd ever pay the highest possible price anyway so that  off discount doesnt apply to any flight youre likely to book for the best strategy search flights from a wide variety of providers comparing rates is the only way to ensure youre getting a competitive price its the closest thing youve got to a foolproof strategy for booking flights here are our top tips most domestic airlines release sales on tuesdays with the majority of competitors matching these deals within  hours to take advantage of these airfare sales and have the largest amount of seats to choose from search for fares on tuesdays and wednesdays historically saturdays have also proved fair prices for domestic travel when heading to a destination serviced by multiple airports be sure to check them all to ensure youre getting the best fare for example if youre flying to new york city search for the major airports jfk laguardia and newark as well as smaller options long islandislip and white plains be flexible with your dates searching a range of dates gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on airfare search then search again frequently checking fares for your preferred route over a fixed period of time eg once or twice per day over a week or two gives you an indepth realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be then when you see a price you think is fair book with confidence knowing youve locked in the best fare for your route and budget bookingbuddy allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered offers and savings are based on information available on these sites there is no guarantee that these prices savings hotels or dates will be available at the time of booking please check the site for the most recent details when you book travel your booking is handled by one of those sites directly not by bookingbuddy transactions and all subsequent customer care are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel bookingbuddy does not control the price rules regulations or restrictions surrounding the price please read all rules and regulations before booking get the scoop heres the truth about those  off hotel deals you may have seen an enticing ad boasting huge discounts on hotel rooms though it got your attention the deals unlikely to hold up when subject to scrutiny here we detail why that discount is likely subtracted from the rooms rack rate the highest price for the room on specific days during the peak booking season since its unlikely that youll ever be charged that price the discount isnt really a discount at all advertisers also like to add extras to the room rate to artificially inflate that  off and sometimes even  off claim

attention are you ready to find out why you shouldnt believe those overhyped advertisements first off those enticing  off  off and  off ads generally refer to discounts off the highestpriced mostrestricted ticket classes refundable etc what the carriers are really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive tickets news flash in most cases theyre providing absolutely no support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances heres the bottom line most leisure travelers never actually buy the costliest mostrestricted tickets those are generally picked up by business travelers shopping on the company dime with lowcost airlines online travel agents and flexible date searches all factoring in to your price hunting its rare that youd ever pay the highest possible price anyway so that  off discount doesnt apply to any flight youre likely to book for the best strategy search flights from a wide variety of providers comparing rates is the only way to ensure youre getting a competitive price its the closest thing youve got to a foolproof strategy for booking flights here are our top tips most domestic airlines release sales on tuesdays with the majority of competitors matching these deals within  hours to take advantage of these airfare sales and have the largest amount of seats to choose from search for fares on tuesdays and wednesdays historically saturdays have also proved fair prices for domestic travel when heading to a destination serviced by multiple airports be sure to check them all to ensure youre getting the best fare for example if youre flying to new york city search for the major airports jfk laguardia and newark as well as smaller options long islandislip and white plains be flexible with your dates searching a range of dates gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on airfare search then search again frequently checking fares for your preferred route over a fixed period of time eg once or twice per day over a week or two gives you an indepth realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be then when you see a price you think is fair book with confidence

and questions with mason mcfee   mason mcfee is an artist and graphic designer behind hello maseman there is no shortage of art styles and mediums that have captured his interests but the raw handsewn patchworks he has crafted lately became the focus of our collaboration his early experiences are rooted in a diy attitude in a small town in texas mixed with growing up with educators gave him the freedom and opportunity to develop a unique tension between the constraints of a professional graphic designer and an artistic spirit that is anything but constrained altru had the opportunity interview him as part of our ongoing artist collaboration projects below is our interview with mason mcfee and some of his art on apparel produced by altru apparel   a hi mason how’s it going and can you tell us a little about yourself mm it’s going great i’m an artist from austin texas i dabble in all sorts of artwork from zines to paintings to murals and whatever captures my interest   a looking back through your art you’ve worked with many different mediums from collage to geometric shapes zines to the patchworks we are involved with in our collaboration they all seem to have a kind of natural organic feel how do you go about doing that mm well i guess i’ve been a doodler and drawer my whole life it’s just something i love to do a lot of the organic nature in my work comes from growing up in boerne a small hill country town in texas outside of san antonio my parents were both educators when i was growing up so they encouraged a lot of exploration while i was a kid i grew up on ten acres and we did all kinds of things around the property including working on cars building with wood making forts and tree houses going fishing in the creek and generally being outdoors i enjoyed the experience of growing up outside of the city limits where we had a little more freedom to do what we wanted   a so you had access and were able to get your hands on different equipment for practical reasons and also to build and create mm yeah we’d do whatever you know my pops showed us how to use power tools and bits about electronics i did a lot of creating in my parents garage making artwork with all the stuff my dad had laying around the place i enjoyed learning new things that’s sort of how the sewing thing came into play lately i was interested in making patches so i was screen printing my own onto fabric my little sister showed me how to use the sewing machine to sew the edges i ended up teaching myself to do embroidery after i saw how easy it was to use sewing is this weird combination of skills similar to using a band saw and sort of like welding but with fabric i kinda enjoy that   a what other mediums are you interested in mm right now i’ve been excited about getting back into making sculptures and installations also i’m doing some collaborations with my new project elmer gomer this will be where i’m going to start selling my patches and artworks but it’s also more of an avenue to sell stuff my artwork i’m not going to just leave it to patches and hats and shirts and stuff but start doing collaborative artworks again with friends on projects    a i saw that you and your wife had collaborated and made over  zines how is it working with your wife and do you often collaborate together mm we collaborate on lots of stuff the zine project we worked together on was called crummy house we lived in this run down house in south austin that inspired the name we’d invite artists over to collaborate on zines that we’d scrap together on our kitchen table that was a project that became useful for meeting other artists and allowing us to do our own thing when we both had full time jobs it ended up being a really great experience at a time when we were both creatively drained so jessica clark is my wife and is a graphic designer in austin as well art  math is her graphic design company we do all sorts of stuff together right now we finally moved out of the crummy house and into a house over in east austin where we now live we enjoy hanging around the house with our two cats and having friends over jess is a graphic  designer for a vegan cupcake company here in austin she does her own thing and i do mine having an artist and designer as a spouse inspires me to create each day we’re going to collaborate on a project with elmer gomer very soon so stay tuned for that   a you had been an art director at an advertising agency how was that mm it was a good experience i graduated college then jumped right into working with someone who was a graphic designer and ended up starting his own agency i worked with him for seven years it taught me how to take a project all the way to completion it helped with learning how to work with people in a professional environment when you work with someone else on a project there are lots of steps making sure they are stoked on what they get at the end also you know learning about processes i needed to do when it comes to ha billing and invoicing and making sure you are getting paid the business world is a tricky one and i’m definitely still learning   a if you had to choose a different career what comes to mind mm i’d probably want to do something outdoors i wouldn’t mind being a park ranger at a national park something out doors for sure i was actually a tour guide as a summer job for a while at a cavern outside of boerne i enjoy the outdoors for sure being out in nature   a any artists or graphic designer favorites mm i was very inspired by maya hayuk growing up i actually got to meet her and she’s kind of a rock star artist that i look up to she does very large outdoor paintings murals i really like her brilliance when it comes to color and her positive energy her work is very bright and psychedelic and i like that she is constantly reinventing her work   a you said you once had a a chance to meet her tell us about that mm when i was still in school i used to do these minizines and send them out to people in the art world that i admired i basically would find their email and ask them if they wanted to trade art packages she was one of the people that responded back we ended up trading stuff like mix tapes cds and stuff in the early days she was just one of those artists that really encouraged you and was engaging as a person so a week after i met jessica i was so in love i followed her on a trip to new york well i thought i’d reach out to maya and she invited us to an anthony lister art show and ended up getting to check out her studio too so that was pretty big especially in my early years just getting started she was inspiring for sure oh also in austin i have a huge family of rad artist friends i’d try and list them all here but the list would seriously be way too long for this interview they are all very inspiring to me for sure   a do you get to travel mm i do get to travel but not as often as i’d like i’m heading out to the west coast soon hopefully a japan trip and maybe sweden in the coming years i’ve got my patches over in a little shop in tokyo called lechoppe they came to my studio in austin and bought pretty much every patch i had in my studio i’m excited to show off a new collatoration with them of  wrangler shirts and jackets they’ll be done pretty soon and for sale this winter   a final question glitter yea or nay mm yea ha thanks mason october    comments sterling bartlett interview collaboration and questions with sterling bartlett a hey sterling how’s it going sb pretty gooda so can you tell us little bit about yourself sb yeah i’m an artist living in los angeles california ive lived and worked here for about  years i do a lot of illustration design and i have a painting practice a describe a day in the life of sterling sb i generally get up about  o’clock take the dog on a hike in the morning come back fix myself some breakfast and get the house in order i’ll generally work from about  am to about  pm i desperately try to keep it monday through friday that generally doesn’t happen but if i don’t keep banker hours i’ll go crazy i’ll work until  in the morning so i try keeping it pretty steady my time is split  between my painting practice and my designillustration work   a where did you grow up sb i was born in dumas texas which is way up in the panhandle by oklahoma i was raised and went to school in san angelo which is in west texas my dad was in the military so we moved around a lot i ended up living in phoenix arizona after high school for quite a while i just had to get the hell out of there so i eventually moved to la   a when did you first get into the art scene and designing sb i have been doing design and illustration professionally for about  years i have exclusively been doing freelance work for about  years   a what was your first job sb that’s hard to remember but i think the first job that mattered to me was working for krw denim with a guy name angel who i met through a friend   a i know of angel he is a maniac sb he’s great i love that guy   a are you in touch with him sb i haven’t seen him in a while but he actually put this bandaid tattoo on me hahaha a how long were you at krw denim sb i just worked for them freelance we met through a mutual friend and i did some work for him off and on i worked a lot with skate surf and that sort of stuff afterward and it just kind of expanded from there   a have you been doing art shows the whole time or did the focus shift to that later on sb i used to do a lot of art exhibitions that kind of took a back seat for a while but it’s become a much bigger focus for me lately   a why is thatsb there is a fulfillment that comes from working in design and illustration that is fantastic but you know its just something else when you can come up with an image in your head and snaps someone immediately feels compelled to own it  it’s just a different beast   a how do you come up with ideas and inspirationsb well that’s tough speaking to my illustrations they incorporate text and humorous sayings that just stems from reading frankly for the paintings it’s a little bit different they are much more based on my environment los angeles the cityscape and the people that’s a more direct documentation of the things i see   a i see on your desk you’re reading the steve martin autobiography are you a fan of standup what other comedians do you likesb i love love standup comedy i love the form so much off the top of my head i’d list richard prior and george carlin let’s see the newer comics there are so many it’s so huge right now there’s kate berlant who i think is amazing kyle mooney hannibal buress i love louie ck i’ve seen a couple times he’s fantastic i’m all over the place i’m just a big fana is the imagery you see around la a large part of what you are doing now sb basically yeah for so long i’d been working with text and i wanted to move away from that and just be completely visual so these images are predominantly me walking around just out walking the dog or taking a hike then stopping and taking photos of something i feel is emblematic of the city   a you have gone through a few phases where your focus is on a particular technique what prompts you to make a change sb i think exploration is a pretty good way of putting it you know i worked in graphite making these kind of verbal asides with visual accompaniment for so long that i felt like i’d just gotten to the end of that phase of my work it felt like i did whatever it was i was going to be able to do there so the medium i’m working in now monoprint allowed me to step away from that and make something totally to the left of it   a can you describe the process of monoprinting sb what i do is a bastardized version of monoprint i cut a stencil out of paper let’s say a palm tree for example i cut the leafy green portion from the top of the tree out then on a separate piece of material whether it’s another piece of paper or glass i will apply the paint i then lay that over the stencil and using a brayer or the back of my hand for pressure print it onto the piece of paper below the stencil the stencil then gets removed leaving us with the first part of the tree i repeat the process using different colors until finisheda what i’ve noticed from your monoprint pieces is the use of bright colors which is nearly an exact opposite of what you’d been doing bringing out a feeling of a fresher more colorful world than from your graphite only pieces sb absolutely i think that was part of change too going back to what we were talking about before boredom is something to look out for graphite is just one color it’s dark gray ha i did that for about  years so i’m trying to go as far away from that as possible another thing is when you’re doing monoprint if you mix too many colors together during the printing process the pushing of the pigment through of the paper muddies them i’m almost forced to use the brightest colors possible in order for them to pop once they’ve been printed onto the surface   a i would imagine the communication with the viewer is much different from your single color graphite works with text vs the layered monoprint form you are creating now is there much difference sb absolutely when i was working with graphite illustrations it was often an image paired with text they were basically inside jokes they were about bringing a certain subset of people together that could understand those jokes in a very specific way that was a communication between me and a select group of people the monoprints because they are purely visual are so much more inclusive a lot more people are on board if i’m being honesta there seems to have been a recent explosion with the zine art form and that culture what are your thoughts on its beginning and where it is going sb in the last  or  years there has been a resurgence of zine culture it’s moved some away from punk and into the realm of art there is certainly an overlap there i myself along with a group of friends are involved  or  times a year in a kind of zine club called “drawing party la” where we get together with an old risograph machine and make a limited number of zines just kind of for ourselves just to do it   a what is a “risograph” sb basically a risograph is a japanese copy machine that puts out a silk screen type of print rather than a photocopy   a looking over some of your collection do you have a cherished zine sb from this collection it’s tough to say i mean i really like them all i have a pretty broad zine library i am proud to say i have boys club  by matt furie that’s awesome adam villacin and travis millard both make a lot of cool zines too many more to name   a have you produced your own zine that is publicly available sb i put out a zine for my last art show called le banquet rousseau it contained a compilation of essays by my friend christina martinez about her experience in los angeles juxtaposed against my paintingsa do you remember any single point when art became a part of your life sb when i was a kid i just always drew it was always a part of my daytoday i can remember drawing at  years old you know that  years and another  years of practice at some point you know it’s what you want to do   a who are some of your favorite artists sb oh that’s so tough i love matisse i just think matisse is incredible i love goya i think raymond pettibone is a hell of a doodler mike kelley robert crumb so many……too many to list i have so many friends that are amazing too i love jason moores work brendon donnelly victor solomon i’m very lucky to know some of my favorite artists   a we got in touch and licensed some of robert crumbs work for tshirts sb that’s awesome   a everybody loved it all the buyers and all the graphic design guys and artists but the public didn’t like it at all sb that’s awful… that’s too bad   a they just didn’t want to wear it his robert crumbs art isn’t pretty sb it’s rough and it’s got a lot going on too…   a that’s a big part of his aesthetic sb yeah the ugly and weird cityscapes are great so detailed   a lastly glitter yea or nay sb absolutely yea ha gets in everything   a thanks sterling what are you going to do now sb i’m going to go grab some lunch            alright sterling thanks and bon appetite may    comment luke pelletier interview collaboration and questions with luke pelletier luke pelletier a recent la transplant from chicago has been up to a lot of things apart from our recent collaboration a solo show at new image art la in august is taking up the majority of his time he still keeps his other interests active like pitching ideas for cartoons or practicing preforming and recording music with a band this work ethic surely helped get him through his early trouble with school the down times between occasional expulsions had an onthejobtraining aspect the time was filled with creating art for promotional fliers and performing music with a band his encouraging parents strong work ethic and an intrinsic creativity guided luke into a career path that included going to saic and receiving an arts degree bfa in below is our interview with luke pelletier and some of his art on apparel produced by altru apparel     a so as a kid did you draw on your books and papers in school if so what kind of stuff lp i drew a lot but it was all over the place i’d copy cartoons and skate graphics i really got into drawing when i started a band i was doing all the flyer’s shirts and album covers a please describe how your interest in art and creativity was nourished or encouraged any group friend teacher or family lp i got in a lot of trouble as a kid i was in and out of different schools pretty quickly my parents always supported my art though i think they always knew i wasn’t going to work a normal job so even if i would get expelled from a school one week they would let me practice and play shows with my band the next they were very supportive a it’s been about a year since you graduated from school of the art institute of chicago saic besides the skills and knowledge you gained what was the greatest influence from that cultural breeding ground lp it’s weird that school was really hard on me they’re a conceptual art school most of my art is based in aesthetics but they pushed me to talk about my art the same way they did so it definitely made me experiment more with how i make work i’ve been really enjoying being out of school though california has been amazing a is your work stream of conscience or ideas thought out and expressed lp both for sure i have to plan out a lot of the patterns and compositions because of the math but i try to always leave room to try new things and goof around my lyrics are mostly stream of conscience and i write a lot of those on my paintings a do you know when a piece is finished or is it hard to stop working on it and adding touches lp i always know if it’s finished i rarely ever touch a painting after i sign it a are you having fun what are you doing for fun lp yeah i’ve been a little stressed lately mostly because my ambition and scale is getting bigger and with that so are my expenses but i try not to worry to much about money for fun i paint write do band practice play shows record songs go to the beach watch tv sketch some old same old a are you a collector of anything lp a ton of stuff but nothing specific i collect art shells beach glass dice matchbooks trinkets mostly just inspiration really a is there a project you would like to do but haven’t been able to yet lp tons but they’re all in the works i’d love to open a bar design a stage do a cartoon etc a what project are you working on now lp today i’m working on a pitch for a cartoon i’ve been working on but i’m mostly working on my solo show at new image art in la it’ll open in august a do you have any use for technology in your creative process lp i email and use photoshop like everyday a are you a binge working artist with periods of down time or do you have a strict work schedule lp i work everyday for the most part i have to many things to do to have any downtime haha i started taking tuesdays off thoughthanks lukesee more at luke’s instagramwwwinstagramcomlukepelletier may    comments inner city arts support campaign the innercity

wwwusimpossibleprojectcom       march    comments simon spilsbury interview introducing simon spilsbury style is more than simply what you like its tied to culture space and time as well as personal preference and on some gut level instinct someone recently caught our eye who fits the altru style sensibility the ridiculously funny talented and prolific illustrator simon spilsbury his art style is very precise but also sometimes sketchy and it grabs you and shakes you about it’s like a very talented juvenile delinquent made off with a very expensive fountain pen he has the classic british touch  loose lines that don’t always connect an airy light touch then slipping into a bold smear true talent makes what is very difficult look easy he’s got that in spades the result is fun cool and definitely someone we want to hang around with as a way of introduction here are some samples of his work printed on a fabric medium along with the short interview we did with simon cheers            a who were the people who influenced youss all the s’s  steadman scarfe searle steinberg and a few others obviously like bernie fuchs seymour chwast alan e cober a what was the first piece of art you remember seeingss i was in my dad’s life room from the age of four so all that i saw there really  oldlady impasto and a bit of hippy psychedelia not much in the way of big galleries until i was well into my teens but i remember the uber ones like the mona lisa guernica and goya’s ‘el tercero de mayo a where do you go to for visual inspiration nowss i don’t have an inspiration routine but my best thinking’s done while walking and i walk a lot  i’m not a fan of being trapped in a vehicle or behind a desk  i don’t even like wearing a hat depends where the inspiration’s needed people is easy just sit outside a cafe in a city and watch how women hold their handbags and how men smoke  or the other way round preferably if it’s inspiration for composition i’ll look at contemporaries who are better designers than me  noma bar seymour chwast or i’ll leaf through george grosz and saul steinberg books a if you could relocate your studio for a year where would you goss it would have to be somewhere in the states not necessarily nyc maybe chicago la or somewhere hicky like oklahoma  i’ve been to oklahoma a couple of times and it’s got its fair share of weirdos to draw a what is your most indispensable bit of kitss my collection of kaweko pens they sound japanese but come from germany and are packaged in a great little tin a if you hadn’t been an illustrator ss my mum once said “why don’t you get a job in the post office” that’s when i packed my bags if i wasn’t a busy illustrator i’d definitely write a bit more but in my dreams i’d be leading people through the jungles in asia with my jungle mate  who incidentally can kill you with his eyeball a what are you working on right nowss various wall drawings a personal project based around celebrity boosting my retail archive and just about to start an animated tvc for a booze company that’s all i’m allowed to say  a how do you unwind at the end of the dayss i don’t really…i annoy the crap out of myself by carrying my sketchbook everywhere and then getting anxious when i haven’t opened it if i’m in the pub i treat it like a life room if i’m at a dinner party i draw naked people for laughs  a do you travel do you enjoy travel when traveling how is your life  creative process effectedss i used to travel a lot as i spent  years travel writing for the sunday times but currently not travelling huge amounts because the kids have got to get through exams and university but it won’t be much longer i have just got back from northern australia and a desert trek in the sahara with all my explorer mates so don’t pity me too much a technology to embrace disregard or rebel against itss necessary evil computer armageddon would suit me well a what relationship do you have to clothingss chuck it on and peel it off i am partial to t’s though   visit simonss website to view more of his creations wwwstudiospilsburycom    february    comments spring   little tokyo our spring  little tokyo drop is now available online
