income  tactical advisor portal fixed income fixedincome securities have proven over time to be a critical part of wellallocated portfolios because it is important to have assets that arent correlated to stockmarket investments bond investing has become increasingly challenging over the years and we believe that an actively managed fixedincome portfolio  either through a separately managed account or a mutual fund  may make sense for longterm investors to that end eagle has employed an experienced team of bond managers analysts and traders to help investors meet their longterm financial goals we offer a wide range of both taxable and taxadvantaged programs  all of which share our focus on fundamental research  we invite you to consider  click the charts below to learn more taxable taxadvantaged risk information risks associated with fixed income investing many investors consider bonds to be “risk free” investment vehicles historically bonds have indeed provided less volatility and less risk of loss of capital than has equity investing however there are many factors that may affect the risk and return profile of a fixedincome portfolio the two most prominent factors are interestrate movements and the creditworthiness of the bond issuer bonds issued by the us government have significantly less risk of default than those issued by corporations and municipalities however the overall return on government bonds tends to be less than these other types of fixedincome securities investors should pay careful attention to the types of fixedincome securities that comprise their portfolio and remember that as with all investments there is the risk of the loss of capital not every investment opportunity will meet all of the stringent investment criteria mentioned to the same degree tradeoffs must be made which is where experience and judgment play a key role accounts are invested at the discretion of the portfolio manager and may take up to

performanceunity automotiveuro partsvaicovemowabcowarriorweaponrwestarwhitelinezone offroadclear allindependent suspensions can be classified according to whether they use struts or shock absorbers a strut is a type of shock absorber that also serves as a supporting suspension member there are modified struts where the springs are separate but the most common type is the macpherson strut which incorporates a shock spring and suspension member in one unit when used at the front of the vehicle the top of the strut is the upper steering pivot shock absorbers are used with control arm suspensions shocks and struts are the most commonly serviced suspension parts because they deteriorate gradually and degrade handling and ride quality it is recommended that they be replaced after  milesleaf springs are the oldest type of springs and generally used to both suspend and locate live axles they are the springs of choice for hauling because they can carry heavy loads and the capacity can be easily increased by adding leaves coil springs are the most common type of spring in use today they are much easier to tune for specific ride andor handling characteristics than leaf springs making them ideal for performance vehicles torsion bars are lengths of spring steel that serve the same purpose as coil springs the advantage of torsion bars is that they can be adjusted to correct vehicle ride height air suspension air springs use compressed air to provide a smooth ride and suspension levelingthe wheels springs and shocks or struts are attached to the vehicle with suspension members called control arms control arms can be called different names according to the suspension system and where they are located on the vehicle including short and long arms radius arms and trailing arms in general they are made of stamped steel or aluminum and articulate by means of bushings and ball joints the control arms themselves are generally very durable and usually only replaced if bent but the bushings and ball joints wear and require replacement to eliminate play that can affect handling and alignment sway bars are a type of torsion bar that connects the wheels on both sides of the vehicle to reduce body roll in turnsfeatured videosarnott air suspension promogood vs bad shockhow to choose the right shocksstopping distancemonroe promosachs nivomat shocksguides

restriction and improve exhaust flow for more power while muffler designs may differ all of our exhaust pipes are mandrel bent mandrel bending ensures smooth bends and maintains tube size and shape throughout the entire length tubes that aren’t mandrel bent can lose a percentage of their diameter in sharp bends which creates restrictionsound is just as important factor in an exhaust system purchase as increased power that’s why each of our systems has been tested to make sure you get just the right exhaust note so you’ll enjoy getting behind the wheel performance and sound are essential but an exhaust system also has to be made of quality materials so it will last all of our systems come in stainless steel or aluminized steel for long lasting durability each includes stylish exhaust tips usually made from stainless steel and highly polished for visual effect but if you prefer something different check out our selection of exhaust tips most of the exhaust systems we have are “cat back” systems meaning they include everything to replace the exhaust system behind the catalytic converter this means your emissions system will be unaffected and your vehicle will still pass a smog check however if you do ever need to replace your catalytic converter we can offer you a performance option that will properly reduce emissions but with increased exhaust flow compared to your original factory converter these converters have a monolithic honeycomb catalyst designed for maximum flow and smoother flowing inlet and outlet jointsif you want to go even further to reduce exhaust restriction and gain power then consider installing headers headers replace the factory exhaust manifolds which usually flow poorly an exhaust header has individual tubes for each exhaust port allowing each exhaust pulse to flow unobstructed from the cylinder head all tubes meet in a larger tube called a collector the tubes on headers are usually larger in diameter than the runners on an exhaust manifold and the tubes are mandrel bent for gradual radius bends which reduces restriction and increases exhaust flowfeatured videoschip fooses fleah pritchetts challenger hellcatmagnaflow at
