tartan if i cannot find my name associated with any of those on the recognised list a   yes tartan is a gift that we have given to the world the idea that a man can only wear a kilt in his own family

click below q  what is the difference between a tartan and a check a  essentially a tartan has a link or association with a family clan institution or region and has a background history explaining

gives the status of tartan its authenticity a  the scottish register of tartans which was established in  as the official scottish register belonging to scotland in the public domain and located within the national archives of scotland q  how were tartans recorded in the past a  prior to the scottish register of tartans there were several privately owned tartan registers in scotland and these tartan records were transferred to the scottish register of tartans in  q  can anyone register a tartan a  in order to enter a tartan into the scottish register of tartans there is an application form with terms and conditions that need to be fulfilled   q  there are so many tartans  what happens if there is a duplicate design a  in theory no two tartans are the same and each tartan has a different thread count of colours  however tartan belongs to culture and not to science so similarities have indeed arisen  today the scottish register of tartans rejects any new tartan which is “confusingly similar” to an existing registered tartan   q  how many tartans are registered each year a  somewhere around  tartans are registered each year   q  do the words “modern” and “ancient” indicate when the tartan originated a  no – well not any more – they relate to the tartan colourway there are three tartan colourways ancient modern and reproduction or weathered ancient tartans used vegetable dyes
