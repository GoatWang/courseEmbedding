emerald ash borer was found in boulder county in september  this destructive pest has caused billions in damaged across the ohio michigan and illinois we have been following the migration of this insect and knew this would happen but hoped it wouldn’t be this soon so what is the emerald ash borer the emerald ash borer is a small but very destructive beetle an adult beetle easily fits on the size of a penny and is metallic green with a slender body that measures half an inch long native to china and eastern asia the beetle most likely arrived in north america hidden in wood packing materials used to ship consumer goods they first arrived in michigan where it was likely present for up to  years before anyone detected it the beetle is behind the death and decline of tens of millions of ash trees and now much to our dismay this pest has arrived in colorado find our more about how we can help name email address message     submit how to identify and monitor ash tree stress symptoms sparse foliage or thinning of the canopy presence of epicormic shoots sprouting from the trunk and roots or suckers bark splitting dshaped emergence holes on trunk increased woodpecker activity serpentine galleries from larvae feeding under the bark how to identify the emerald ash borer adults are approximately  inch long metallic emerald green head and back bark splitting coppery
