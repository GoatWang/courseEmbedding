media business editor janemartinson friday  february   est first published on friday  february   est lucian grainge is sitting crosslegged on his office sofa twiddling his fingers and trying not to sound irritated by questions about the role of big business in the music industry the head of universal music uk  which sells one in four of the records we buy and manages acts from keane to eminem to u  is adamant that universal is not really very commercial at all what makes something corporate i believe our company is the least corporate company in the corporate world he says its built up with a bunch of talented focused intelligent passionate people who like developing music and making it why is that corporate it is a question that could be answered this wednesday night at the annual industry lovein that is the british record industry awards or brits millions of viewers will tune in to watch stars such as franz ferdinand joss stone snow patrol and both bedingfields perform at the th anniversary event many more millions of pounds will be raised for charity largely through corporate tables that dominate the space at the earls court event rather than the few hundred screaming fans likely to dominate television screens at last years event one industry executive described beyoncé as a great product beautifully packaged grainge  and a cochairman of this years event has little time for those who fear the impact of the increasingly huge global record companies on the business the awards are an opportunity for us to enjoy and celebrate british music and celebrate the music business he says to be fair grainge and the british music industry itself have something to celebrate this year the industry finds itself in positive sales territory for the first time in years with a  increase in album sales universals sales rose  in the uk last year as the market leader managed to increase its share of the albums and singles market to more than  it had three albums in the top  including the top two by scissor sisters and keane these two acts are also indicative of what has been described as a resurgent british music industry scissors an american band were signed in the uk four of the top five albums were by british acts last year four of whom were previously unknown acts peter jamieson chairman of the trade body the british phonographic industry says he cant remember the last time the charts were not dominated by foreigners the success last year earned grainge and his team a special mention in last weeks results from its giant parent company vivendi universal they were praised for an exceptional year for breaking new artists it isnt long in the conversation with grainge before talk turns to which new acts could help make this year as good as last any discomfort disappears and like an ageing rock star coming into a packed auditorium he jumps up from the sofa and runs over to his stereo system shouting thats the best bit before we know where we are he has turned up the volume on a demo disc and launched into a story about the next big thing the story starts when someone who knew grainge  years ago rang and said hed found a new talent he brings this guy in and i flip says grainge i do it on the spot i call the head of mercury one of universals record labels and i say if you like this as much as i like it weve got a deal thats the gift this guy bobby kray his name is kray he looks like someone from jamiroquai yet has the voice of an angel he was a choir boy at st pauls or somewhere when he was  or something  hes the machinegun patter stalls momentarily hes stunning but how can he tell that this new act will sell grainge who is wearing a dark suit over an opennecked shirt revealing a mat of dark chest hair leans over and says i can smell it after  or  years its a smell by this point he is rifling through the stack of discs and tapes on his desk we sit listening to at least five different yettobe launched acts grainge a stocky man hums nods and stamps along to the entire show he knows the pauses speaks up at the bits that need a little bit more work and points out the choruses that will work how does this middleaged man who grew up in north london loving the clash and the sex pistols know what it takes for a hiphop pop or soul song to work at this question he smiles and says softly thats the gift i was a publisher for the first  years of my career i understand songs its very very difficult to define i can definitely smell it i can feel it in my fingertips his ability to pick artists who work across a range of styles does mark grainge out but then it also marks out universal which produced half of the classical albums released last year as well as busted his gift is allied to his business skills in describing the first time he heard one new act the bravery he says it was the best thing id heard i absolutely loved it it ticked every box  radio tv press merchandise the look the trend yet it is impossible not to feel that grainge really does love music and not just because the words i love this business and i absolutely love this act like a refrain to his speech he left school at  after walking out of an alevel exam to attend a meeting in which he helped to negotiate his first record deal he earned £ and knew he had crossed a divide i felt comfortable and normal around musicians and artists and managers i liked the social scene and loved the music i was absolutely obsessed with it his life today  regular dinners with sir elton john and a big house near richmond southwest london  is a far cry from his early days when his father owned a television and radio shop with a carousel of s in it and the young lucian managed a band at school yet he maintains a link to what people really want he says by taking some of his senior managers to local high streets youre going to think im mad but what i do with my senior people is go and observe people he says i love going to coventry harrow west bromwich thats where i walk into stores and get a sense of what people are wearing and what they want theres an awful lot of data in the record business  but to actually see these people and get a sense of demographics he tails off he is scathing of critics of realitytv programmes such as pop idol or fame academy describing them simply as family entertainment he adds why not let people enjoy themselves why must we judge people all the time his first proper job was plugging songs trying to get radio stations to play his companys music within five years he had moved to a record label and was director of ar  artist and repertoire  which combines spotting talent with developing it grainge believes his background and that of his top team differentiates universal from its main competitors which are now reduced to three after sony and bmg agreed to merge last year explaining the difference grainge says i am from an ar background all those other guys are from marketing jamieson at the bpi who is cochair of the brits says grainge is a oneoff  in what can appear a cutthroat music business he can be both harsh and gentle both businessman and music devotee his boss doug morris chairman of universal music group has said of him he is so deceptive with that little kind face and those little glasses behind them he is actually a killer shark despite his obvious love of the industry grainge is reluctant to name the music he listens to for pleasure he begins by saying he cant listen to music at home as his youngest children who are five and  overtake the system so what does he listen to in the car alone i love listening to the scissors in the car they had the numberone biggest most successful selling album last year how about music he wasnt necessarily involved in the buzz of listening to one of the artists we have been involved with and which has sold millions is very therapeutic he smiles but is there any music he just really loves finally he says presley led zeppelin the clash the sex pistols but he admits he could never name a truly favourite band especially not a stillperforming one for fear of the people who would feel slighted when youre in this business and particularly when youve been in this business since you were  like i have theres no difference between the personal and business he says previous interviews have made much of the running machine unplugged and unloved at the back of grainges office but he seems to use up plenty of energy bouncing around the room and talking about work i love it i am stimulated by it the only time that the phone doesnt ring and the blackberry doesnt work is over christmas but thats because no one else is working this wednesday grainge is likely to be in his element his frontrow table at the brits will be graced by some of universals top international executives as well as the singer amy winehouse a million miles away from all those record buyers in the midlands yet when he hears that my mum is an il divo fan he insists that i take her a new tape from a yettobe released crooner patrizio buanne shes a big market your mum give her this and tell me what she thinks tell me as soon as possible before next week really i mean it and i think he really does the cv born north london education left school at  career  joined april musiccbs as a song plugger promoted to head of the creative

by convincing jay z one of pop music’s top stars and entrepreneurs  to sign for  universal music  which he heads – lucian grainge getty –    by yoel bermant  despite being just in his early fifties lucian grainge has been one of the key players in the music industry for more than thirty years helping to guide the careers of such international superstars ranging from amy winehouse to abba sting to andrea bocelli with countless others in between many music industry observers are saying that grainge may have pulled off its greatest deal yet by convincing a certain shawn corey carter known to all followers of rap music as jayz jayz’s music style is described as american rap yet he is much more than just a simple rapper with talents including being a record producer and music industry entrepreneur in his own right jayz has succeeded in reaching a  net worth estimated to be approaching five hundred million dollars much of it gained from recording producing and managing the careers of a number of other prominent singers in the rap genre through his roc nation record label  under jayz’s  leadership roc nation that has become one of the most successful brands in today’s pop music

released by roc nation although no financial details have been released as yet both grainge and jay z were both reported to be highly satisfied with the terms of the agreement described as a “a new age deal” that according to jay z will provide the roc nation record label with a unique opportunity that of being able to continue to operate as an independent label while enjoying the strength power and reach of one of the music industry’s best run and best managed recording companies the agreement with the roc nation record label marks another significant victory for universal music part of the

no  lucian grainge chairmanceo universal music group he gambled everything for emi and now looks set to win bigger than previously imagined if anyone in the music business still has any doubt about the wisdom of lucian grainge’s careerdefining decision to risk his stellar reputation by bidding for emi in  consider this just  months after the deal closed universal music group umg parent vivendi received a whopping bid of  billion to buy the music behemoth and was able to turn it down media assets are typically valued at around six to seven times operating profits by that valuation metric the bid was about  billion higher than would typically be expected but that was the bet grainge was making all along like anyone else in this business he is acutely aware of the struggles the industry has faced for the last decade in a state of seemingly permanent decline—perhaps more so as you would be if you were responsible for the livelihoods of  employees and more than  artists but as a true music man to his core he has never stopped believing in the return to growth for the industry and others are starting to believe “every morning when i wake up i realize the consumer has total choice” grainge says “we don’t have the divine right to expect consumers to buy our product yet after all is said and done i believe the industry will return to the level of growth that we’ve hoped for and have been fighting for for the last  years” grainge isn’t interested in specifying what that level of growth is—his point is that the last  years have been the opposite of growth and for him there are many reasons for optimism as music business revenue opportunities continue to diversify away from a reliance on retail to areas more beloved by investors—subscription services digital platforms with access to youth and highmargin brand partnerships—the value of music assets will at worst hold steady but more than likely appreciate grainge has almost guaranteed that umg as an alldominant market leader will benefit disproportionately from the rebound it’s a key reason why the july bid from japan’s softbank was so high it’s also the reason why even some of those who publicly objected to the bid at the time now privately admit grainge made the right move when thinking about grainge’s vision—and the determination and power it took to realize it—it’s important to remember just how controversial umg’s offer for emi was it drew strong objections from several quarters of the business which balked at a company that already possessed more than  market share being allowed to take another  grainge had to make his case before a congressional committee in a testy performance that some felt might derail the deal it was such a risky bid that grainge was under intense pressure that spilled over into his press encounters even after the deal was approved but talking to grainge a year later is revealing success seems to have humbled him as he marvels at how well his team has integrated the main emi assets capitol and virgin that they retained in such a short period of time pages  next › pages  next › print  jay z  beyonce the  billboard power   coran capshaw sir lucian
