british schoolboys are stranded on a tropical island in an attempt to recreate the culture they left behind they elect ralph to lead with the intellectual piggy as counselor but jack wants to lead too and onebyone he lures the boys from civility and reason to the savage survivalism of primeval hunters in lord of the flies william golding gives us a glimpse of the savagery that underlies even the most civilized human beings written by william golding type of  work novel genres social commentary allegory first published  setting deserted tropical island main characters ralph jack piggy simon samneric roger major thematic topics evil outlets for violence human nature speech silence motifs savagery versus civilization major symbols main characters piggys glasses the beast fire conch shell lord of the flies movie versions lord of the flies  lord of the flies  the three most important aspects of lord of the flies the major theme of lord of the flies is that humans are essentially barbaric if not downright evil the stranded boys begin by establishing a society similar to the one they left behind in england but soon their society has degenerated into rival clans ruled by fear and violence before the book is over three boys have been killed the novel is an allegory which is a story in which characters settings and events stand for things larger than themselves for example the island represents the world ralph and jack symbolize different approaches to leadership william golding wrote lord of the flies following world war ii during which the nazis exterminated six million jews and the united states dropped two atomic bombs on japan in this context the novels profound pessimism is understandable previous next book summary pop quiz by the end of the book who is
