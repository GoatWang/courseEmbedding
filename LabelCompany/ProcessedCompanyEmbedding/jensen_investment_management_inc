term investment perspective our view on valuations you are now leaving jensen investment and entering jensen mutual funds jensen separately managed accounts jensen home jensen home about jensen our team community back to news convert to pdf   investment blog post our view on valuations perspective is key by allen bond cfa portfolio manager in recent conversations with both clients and the media the topic of valuation has been a common theme  we believe perspective is vital one particularly pointed question of this variety was presented during a recent appearance on cnbc  the hosts cited the seemingly irrational divergence between movements in the bond and stock markets and inquired about the valuation implications for both  they highlighted that the sp  index continues to flirt with alltime highs while the year treasury yield is approaching year lows  and they are not the only market observers interested in this trend  jeffrey gundlach the often outspoken founder and manager of doubleline capital recently referred to this phenomenon as “market mass psychosis” are markets behaving irrationally we view the crux of this argument as follows  on the surface a stock market trading near alltime highs indicates at a minimum benign fundamentals  currently we see evidence of this in steady if plodding by historical standards domestic economic growth and an improving jobs market  on the other hand the sharp rally in the treasury market could indicate a ‘flighttoquality’ foreshadowing an impending uptick in market volatility so back to mr gundlach’s characterization is the market crazy or is there a rational explanation we believe perspective is critical here  jensen’s perspective is that of a longterm investor and we view the ebb and flow of these relationships over the period of multiple market cycles  and through that lens the current relationship between stock and bond prices may ultimately prove to be unsustainable however we do not believe it to be irrational or even psychotic as gundlach suggests given the current investment climate investors of all stripes continue to search for income  in our view this desire in combination with a supportive fundamental backdrop and low absolute treasury yields has rationally led to a simultaneous rally in both stock and bond prices  case in point highdividend paying stocks have led the equity market in  while the decline in bond yields has come primarily from a ‘flattening’ at the longer end of the treasury yield curve implications for jensen’s investment philosophy our cnbc appearance was a good reminder that not all market participants share our perspective  specifically the show hosts wanted us to identify a nearterm catalyst that would end this socalled imbalance  perhaps the catalyst will be an uptick in inflation or signs of a sustainable increase in corporate earnings growth  however these are at best educated guesses and we do not believe in investing based on such speculation at jensen we continue to build the portfolio one stock at a time based on companyspecific fundamentals and valuations  we realize however that this endeavor does not take place in a vacuum and that price discipline becomes paramount in the current investing environment  we have executed more sales of portfolio companies based solely on valuation in the past two years than at any period in recent history  at the same time our ‘bench’ of potential portfolio candidates remains robust and we continue to see valuation opportunities  this is evidenced in our addition of two new companies to the jensen quality growth fund portfolio thus far in  the bottom line is that we remain steadfast in our philosophy of diligent bottomup portfolio construction  within this construct we maintain that the right balance of patient and nimble investing is critical and consequently do not see longterm discipline and shortterm flexibility as mutually exclusive    gundlach says wall street’s suffering ‘mass psychosis’ – marketwatchcom  opinions expressed are subject to change at any time are not guaranteed and should not be considered investment advice   previous post top next post show me more
