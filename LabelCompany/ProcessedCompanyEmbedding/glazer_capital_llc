directory or page using the credentials that you supplied glazer capital llc issues open letter to shareholders of privatebancorp inc glazer capital llc issues open letter to shareholders of privatebancorp inc believes the cibc merger consideration clearly undervalues the company in light of the recent surge in regional bank valuationsexplains that the only way for shareholders to preserve their ability to receive full and fair value for their investment is by rejecting the proposed merger with cibc at the upcoming special meeting next weekurges shareholders to deny cibc the ability to reap the windfall precipitated by recent bankfavorable market developmentsgratified that iss recognizes that the proposed merger undervalues privatebancorp and recommends shareholders vote against the acquisition news provided by glazer capital llc dec    et share this article new york dec   prnewswire  glazer capital llc the manager of investment funds that collectively beneficially own  shares of privatebancorp inc nasdaq pvtb privatebancorp common stock issued an open letter today to privatebancorp shareholders detailing reasons for rejecting the proposed acquisition of privatebancorp by cibc the cibc merger at the special meeting of privatebancorp shareholders scheduled to be held on december   the special meeting the letter demonstrates among other things that i the cibc merger would prevent shareholders from realizing the benefits of the recent surge in regional bank valuations ii privatebancorps board of directors has no choice under the terms of its merger agreement with cibc but to present the cibc merger for a vote by shareholders at the upcoming special meeting iii rejection of the cibc merger at the upcoming special meeting would not jeopardize the cibc merger and is the best means available for shareholders to achieve full and fair value iv using traditional comparative valuation methodologies similar to those employed by goldman sachs and sandler oneill in their respective fairness opinions we believe that privatebancorps share price would exceed  per share absent the merger agreement with cibc v we believe that goldman sachs and sandler oneill would not be able to rerender their fairness opinions based on current valuations and vi we applaud iss for its pragmatic proshareholder approach the full text of the letter follows below december   dear fellow privatebancorp shareholders on june   canadian imperial bank of commerce cibc announced an agreement to acquire privatebancorp inc privatebancorp or the company for cash and stock consideration the cibc merger then valued at  per share a  premium to privatebancorps prior closing price of  the unaffected price on june   since then we have witnessed a seismic shift in the valuation of regional banks rendering inadequate the merger consideration and obsolete the fairness opinions provided by goldman sachs goldman and sandler oneill sandler glazer capital llc glazer capital is the beneficial owner of  shares of privatebancorp and our sole interest is to ensure that all shareholders receive full and fair value for their investment in the company we join institutional shareholder services iss in calling on shareholders to reject the cibc merger as presently structured at the special meeting of privatebancorp shareholders scheduled to be held on december   the special meeting  as we demonstrate herein shareholders have very little to lose by rejecting the cibc merger but a lot to gain privatebancorps shareholders are being asked to approve a transaction on december   that offers what is now at best a negligible premium and more likely a discount to privatebancorps standalone fair value  it is important to understand that the merger agreement signed by privatebancorp and cibc contractually compels the board of directors of privatebancorp the board to maintain its recommendation in favor of the cibc merger and to present the merger to shareholder for approval at the upcoming special meeting forcing privatebancorp shareholders to take matters into their own hands by voting against the cibc merger  it is equally important to understand that a rejection of the cibc merger on december th would not cause the termination of the merger agreement as privatebancorp would be contractually obligated to adjourn or postpone the special meeting up to two times in the event that shareholders fail to approve the cibc merger  what this would do however is unequivocally demonstrate to the boards of both privatebancorp and cibc that privatebancorps shareholders demand an adequate premium to standalone value in order to approve a merger proposal and that they refuse to allow cibc to reap the windfall resulting from the recent significant increase in bank valuations we hope that it is as clear to you as it is to us and to iss that voting against the cibc merger is a low risk method of pursuing the maximum value that we shareholders deserve for our investment in the shares of privatebancorp share price performance of comparable companies it is clear from the share prices of regional banks that market participants expect them to prosper under the trump administration based on we believe the likelihood of less restrictive regulation of regional banks lower corporate taxes and higher interest rates  since june   the day preceding the announcement of the agreement with cibc shares of the  comparable companies peers selected by goldman in its fairness opinion page  of the proxy statement and shares of the  peers selected by sandler in its fairness opinion page  of the proxy statement have on average appreciated in excess of  table   shareholders of privatebancorp however are being offered merger consideration worth only  more than privatebancorps unaffected price if privatebancorps shareholders approve the cibc merger at the special meeting they will forfeit the opportunity to reap the benefit of the recent seismic shift in the value ascribed to asset sensitive regional banks  the proposed cibc merger is more aptly a takeunder not a takeover table percentage change from june   through november   goldman sachs peers average  sandler oneill peers average  ishares us regional banks etf ticker iat  sp regional bank select industry index  privatebancorp merger consideration value  valuation of comparable companies the tables on pages  and  of the proxy statement present valuation metrics from goldmans and sandlers fairness opinions table  specifically the tables illustrate that at the time that the fairness opinions were rendered by goldman and sandler the  merger consideration represented price to earnings per share eps price to stated book value sbv and price to tangible book value tbv ratios well in excess of privatebancorps peers table fairness opinion valuation metrics privatebancorp  initial merger consideration value x  e eps x sbv x tbv   median of goldmans  peers as of  x e eps x sbv x tbv   median of sandlers  peers as of    x e eps x sbv x tbv however if one were to recalculate those same valuation metrics today and compare privatebancorp to its peers using current market valuations one can reasonably conclude that the merger consideration no longer values privatebancorps sharers at much of a premium furthermore prior to the announcement of the cibc merger privatebancorps shares already traded at a premium to many of its peers table  we therefore believe it reasonable to conclude that privatebancorps shares are trading today at a price below that at which they would trade absent the merger agreement with cibc table  privatebancorp premium vs peers e pe price  sbv price  tbv as presented in the proxy statement as of   privatebancorp  close on  x x x privatebancorp  initial merger consideration value x x x goldman peers median x x x privatebancorp initial premium vs peers x x x sandler peers median x x x privatebancorp initial premium vs peers x x x recalculated as of  source bloomberg privatebancorp  updated consideration value x x x goldman peers median x x x privatebancorp updated premium vs peers  x x       x      sandler peers median x x x privatebancorp updated premium vs peers  x x      x      private bancorps share price has been anchored due to the proposed merger we believe that privatebancorps shares have underperformed the averages of two diversified groups of companies deemed comparable to it by goldman sachs and sandler oneill because  of the merger consideration is a fixed amount of cash and  is in the form of cibc shares which have appreciated only  since june   financial media and wall street analysts appear to attribute the recent material share price appreciation of us midtier banks to the fact that the interest rate and regulatory environments under a trump administration are expected to be favorable to smaller banks it is hard to conceive of a reason that absent the cibc merger the shares of privatebancorp a premier chicago based asset sensitive bank with a ci loan book primed to benefit from rising short term interest rates would not have appreciated at least commensurately with the  average share price appreciation achieved by its peers had privatebancorps shares increased by  since june   its share price would be  before any takeover premium for the aforesaid reasons we believe that the cibc merger woefully shortchanges privatebancorp shareholders we applaud iss for rejecting a rubberstamp approach and we challenge glass lewis and
