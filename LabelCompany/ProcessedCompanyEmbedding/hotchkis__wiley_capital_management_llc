performance fund news fund literature how to invest how to reduce sales charges news  media investment approach focused on value our investment approach is based on the conviction that a securitys market price does not always accurately reflect the companys value when investor sentiment emotions or shortterm trends cause the price of a security to deviate from its intrinsic worth we see opportunity consistent with this approach we believe true investment risk is the potential for permanent loss rather than shortterm price volatility or deviation from a benchmark driven by research finding opportunities begins with research over the years we have sharpened our inhouse research capabilities enabling us to tune out the noise generated by temporal factors and focus on a companys fundamentals — the true indicators of longterm performance when we find securities that we consider undervalued we dig deeper to evaluate risk and model the ability of the company to generate earnings under different conditions over the long term our rigorous research helps us find securities that are being adversely affected by misguided sentiment or unsustainable trends or exaggerated risks the breadth and depth of our proprietary research allows us to investigate stocks with limited wall street coverage that may be overlooked guided by a welldefined process research fuels conviction process ensures discipline we prefer to build diversified portfolios with the best riskadjusted securities rather than own hundreds of securities that would dilute our advantage each security we select has been thoroughly researched peerreviewed by team members and compared to other opportunities the most attractive securities receive the highest weighting in our portfolios and are sold as they approach our estimate of fair value or when their risk profiles exceed our acceptable limits by consistently applying our process we ensure that our conviction is based on wellestablished and proven economic principles designed to deliver longterm results everything we do is guided by our commitment to deliver longterm value to our clients we invest with a multiyear horizon in mind our research is based on enduring economic principles our process discipline ensures we remain true to our style over market cycles our results show that taking a long view ultimately delivers a better investment outcome
