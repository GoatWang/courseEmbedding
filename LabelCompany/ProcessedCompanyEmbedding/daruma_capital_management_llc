invest  daruma capital management llc where every stock counts philosophydaruma’s investment approach is defined by certain key beliefs a concentrated portfolio compels truly active management in any market we can find  to  stocks with strong potential to outperform the best time to buy is not just when a stock offers good value but when we can clearly define what will drive the price higher — in most cases betterthanexpected sales earnings or cash flow growth processmanaging a portfolio where every stock counts means managing an investment process where every decision counts step  – screen universe identify smidcap and smallcap stocks that are undervalued and changing for the better step  – quantitative analysis identify key drivers of past growth step  – qualitative analysis identify key drivers of future growth step  – investment thesis synthesize prior analysis into fundamental milestones step  – valuation define upside and downside price targets step  – weekly review monitor and implement sell discipline in light of milestones price targets new opportunities and aggregate portfolio risk portfolio constructiondaruma invests within a clear set of rules about portfolio concentration and diversification valuation and the sell discipline — and most important rules about paying attention and acting decisively when necessary our portfolios do not mirror the benchmarks we own no more than  highconviction holdings and no less than  sector exposure is capped at the greater of  or two times the benchmark weight a position starts at  is capped at  and in practice rarely gets above  past performance is not a guarantee of future results many factors affect performance including changes in market conditions and interest rates as well as other economic political and financial developments you should not assume that investment decisions we make in the future will be profitable or will equal the investment performance of the past the portfolio is actively managed
