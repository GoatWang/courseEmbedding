front of his photovoltaic cells apparatus when people say that the existing supply of fossil fuels will last another  or  years… this doesn’t mean that life as we know it will last  or  yearsas the world continues to become more and more dependent on fossil fuels with the us alone consuming  million barrels each day the question of the future looms larger every day what is the world going to do when oil runs out uncover israel  get the israelcweekly edition free by email sign up now solar power has usually been dismissed as a possible answer to the problem because of its high cost and relatively low efficiency but a new type of solar power cell being developed in israel by one of the world’s foremost experts in the field promises to change that in professor david faiman’s world of concentrator photovoltaic cells cpv cells solar power just might be the answer to the fuel dilemma “traditional photovoltaic cells do two things collect sunlight and generate electricity from it” said faiman of bengurion university’s jacob blaustein institutes for desert research in sde boker “what we’ve done is simply split those two functions so that the sunlight is collected and concentrated by a dishshaped mirror and a small number of concentrator cells generate electricity from that highly concentrated sunlight photovoltaic material is far too expensive to waste on something that can be accomplished with cheap glass and steel” faiman’s apparatus which resembles an enormous satellite dish rises high above his modest offices in the middle of the negev desert each of the dish’s mirrors can concentrate the sun’s energy by a factor of about  before reflecting it up to the solar cells that hang suspended over the apex of the dish when all  of the mirrors used for the project are uncovered sometimes only one or two are used for testing purposes the cells are on the receiving end of the light of a thousand suns the dish which weighs about  tons is wheelmounted onto a rotating base so that it can turn around following the sun over the course of a day the dish’s motors move it using a minute amount of the power that it generates a recent faiman research paper analyzed the weather conditions in california and the southwestern united states concluding that the economics of building concentrator solar power plants there were nothing short of phenomenal the paper was published in a journal called energy policy instead of faiman’s usual solar energy materials and solar cells because he thought that “there’s more of a chance governor schwarzenegger will pay attention to a journal with the name energy policy” “this kind of power plant will cost a little less than  per kilowatt to build which is exactly the same as the cost of current fossil fuel plants – except that you wouldn’t have to buy any fuel” faiman told israelc “if the electricity were sold at israel’s going rate of nine cents per kilowatthour the profit margin would be such that the entire investment in solar energy infrastructure could be paid off within twenty years and all that while the country could be building more solar power plants using some of the profit from existing ones” this kind of statewide approach to investing in solar power was recently proposed by dov raviv the “father” of the arrow antimissile project who coauthored the energy policy paper with faiman existing solar power plants produce power at three to four times the current rate of nine cents per kilowatthour they survive through government subsidies and laws forcing power companies to purchase solar energy at inflated prices “in the name of greendom” as faiman put it concentrator solar cells promise to make solar energy into more than just an ‘environmentalists’ toy” the new technology developed under a three million euro grant from the eu is the result of a partnership between the ben gurion university of the negev the german fraunhofer institute who developed the concentrator cells and other european institutions cpv cells use gallium arsenide as their principal photovoltaic material whereas traditional solar cells are made of crystallized silicon gallium arsenide cells were developed alongside silicon photovoltaics in the sixties but largely abandoned due to their high cost but because the cells used with the concentrating mirror are very small – around  times smaller than traditional solar panels used in power generation – cost ceases to be the limiting factor that it was when vast amounts of photovoltaic material were required in order to collect sunlight in its dilute form despite their high price gallium arsenide cells are used without any focusing mechanisms in applications like the space station where cost is not an issue the efficiency of silicon cells  to begin with increases to only about  when dealing with concentrated solar energy the efficiency of gallium arsenide cells on the other hand increases with even higher concentrations of sunlight starting at around  and easily doubling this figure more advanced versions of cpv cells are being developed with projected efficiencies of  the current generation of cpv cells is singlejunction – meaning that they have only one “sandwich” of photovoltaic material which does not capture the full spectrum of sunlight by adding additional layers of material with each layer slightly tweaked to capture different parts of the sun’s spectrum scientists hope to create a cpv cell that will utilize much more of the sun’s potential energy this summer faiman’s team will install a fullfledged prototype concentrator cell module at the apex of the solar mirror and enter the final phase of testing he plans to publish a paper on his project by the end of the year which he hopes will be ‘sensational’” faiman born in england came to israel by way of illinois oxford and geneva  years ago he currently lives in sde boker in a “passive solar” house which is built with angles and window sizes precisely calculated so that all of the house’s heating and cooling needs are taken care of by the sun “when people say that the existing supply of fossil fuels will last another  or  years at current rates of consumption this doesn’t mean that life as we know it will last  or  years – and aside from that the rate of consumption goes up all the time” he said “unless the world starts installing infrastructure for solar energy now we’ll shortly be faced with a very serious problem when fossil fuel prices skyrocket and the world rapidly spirals into chaos” faiman envisions a place for fossil fuels in his ideal solar world it would be kept literally for a rainy day when there isn’t enough sunlight to run solar generators “it would be nice to save fossil fuels for more important things than burning them” he says “like the whole petrochemical plastics industry for example” share tweet linkedin email print read more on   technology more about technology when awesome means
