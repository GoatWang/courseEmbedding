oil tools – a line of advanced liner hanger systems and other completion tool technologies products and accessories bulldog frac pinpoint annular fracturing system the bulldog frac annular fracturing system enables operators to precisely control the placement of proppant in each stage by pumping down the coiled tubing annulus through multiple openclose moc sliding sleeves providing for an unlimited number of stages and leaving no restrictions in the wellbore the bulldog frac system addresses the operational challenges of most moc systems with a “shift up to open” design performed with nov’s proprietary hydraulic shifting tool which ensures no sleeves are accidentally closed on the trip out unlike competitors’ products bulldog frac sleeves are compact lightweight and do not require handling pup joints allowing for safer and more efficient installation additionally the bulldog incorporates nov’s patented and fieldproven sealing system which offers full pressure testing of previously manipulated sleeves even after several years in service bullmastiff openhole sand control balldrop fracturing system the bullmastiff fracturing system is a proprietary openhole slidingsleeve system that incorporates sand screens to eliminate costly sandproduction issues while maximizing hydrocarbon production the balldrop frac sleeve component is the first to allow for proppant stimulation with integral sand control segregating the stimulation port from the production port the bullmastiff incorporates nov’s patented flex sleeve and sealing technology to allow for maximum stagecount flexibility rottweiler frac plugs compact largebore rottweiler frac plugs are the shortest on the market but still offer optimum performance during fracturing operations rottweiler frac plugs can be pumped in at high displacement rates hold high differential pressure and are easily milled additionally rottweiler frac plugs are the only products to offer a builtin chemical tracer that provides realtime data on reservoir characteristics during frac jobs to enhance production rottweiler frac plugs are currently available in castiron with a composite version expected to be released in the near future react remote activation technology the react product family which was acquired from omega completion technology offers remote signaling capabilities to downhole valves and sleeves the technology can be utilized for a number of applications including programmable sleeves which respond to a particular pressure or flow signal and require no hydraulic or umbilical lines to surface the react technology currently has applications for inflow control for water shutoff or zonal isolation liner hanger deployment production packer setting and wellbore cleanup in preparation for flowthrough sand screen completions these interventionless solutions provide the lowestcost intelligent completion technologies on the market german oil tools liner hanger technologies german oil tools offers a portfolio of wellconstruction and completion products that are highly regarded for quality and reliability and are currently sold in europe the middle east and africa the operation which includes gps oil tools will continue to develop and manufacture products in germany to retain high standards of quality craftsmanship and innovation but will benefit from nov’s global sales

slurry and molasses all have one thing in common they can be pumped using nov monoflo progressing cavity pc pumps pc pumps are ideal for handling shearsensitive fluids that contain abrasive materials andor high solids content regardless of their viscosity pc pumps consist of a single helix shaft rotor that rotates within a double helix fixed housing statorthe rotor always has one less helix than the stator so when it rotates it forms a continuous cavity that progresses towards the discharge end of the pump to convey process fluid out with a pc pump pressure is independent of speed which allows the pump to achieve the head required while running at a low speed for long wear life wellsuited for both low and highflow applications pc pumps can be adapted into multistage pumps for high pressurehandling capabilities features and benefits continuous flow eliminates pipeworkdamaging pulsations continuous seal line between rotor and stator eliminates product backflow and slip variety of construction materials for adaptability to nearly any operating condition low running speeds for long wear life rolling action of rotor releases trapped solids quickly reducing abrasive wear longhaul pumping eliminates the need for a series of pumps suction lift up to ’ allows deep sumps to be emptied without submersible equipment gentle pumping action keeps delicate solids intact minimizing shear crush damage and solid degradation continuous cavities handle suspended solids with ease constant discharge capacity for a given speed rotation and pressure for accurate metering and dosing reduced wear extends periods between routine maintenance positive displacement for a uniform flow dual directional capability allows one pump to meet all operational needs ability to turn suction chamber °

search national oilwell varco incs results continue their slow grind higher the oilfield equipment maker notched its second consecutive quarter of rising revenue and third straight profit improvement matthew dilallo tmfmd apr   at am the oil industry is slowly but surely starting to pull out of its nosedive with those improving conditions companies are starting to spend more money on equipment which is in turn driving a recovery in national oilwell varcos nysenov financial results while it has been a slow process since the industrys recovery has primarily been onshore the company expects that as the upturn continues to take hold it will benefit disproportionately because of its low costs and product portfolio drilling down into the numbers national oilwell varco reported  billion in revenue for the quarter which while down  versus the prior year is up  versus last quarter marking the second consecutive quarterly increase that said the company did report another quarterly loss even after adjusting for onetime items it had an operating loss of  million or  per share which was slightly worse than last quarters loss of  million or  per share however its underlying earnings as measured by adjusted ebitda rose to  million up  million from last quarter which was the third straight jump image source getty images driving these improvements were sales of equipment to the north american land market especially products in its wellbore technologies and completion and production solutions segments segment revenue q  q  q  rig systems   million   million   million rig aftermarket   million   million   million wellbore technologies   million   million   million completion and production solutions   million   million   million data source national oilwell varco leading the way was the completion and production solutions segment not only did revenue increase  versus last quarter and  versus the yearago period but adjusted ebitda surged  and  respectively over those same periods  another positive was sales in the wellbore technologies segment which rose  versus last quarter and fueled a  surge in adjusted ebitda that said revenue and adjusted ebitda were both down  year over year meanwhile the companys other two segments rig systems and rig aftermarket continued to decline because both focus heavily on the offshore market which hasnt yet hit bottom actual results though differed significantly from the companys expectations heading into the quarter for example it thought that rig systems revenue would drop  to  through aggressive cost management would keep the profit decline to a minimum however while the sales decrease of  beat guidance adjusted ebitda plunged  versus last quarter meanwhile rig aftermarket experienced a similar result as the  slump in revenue matched expectations for a midsingledigit decline however the company expected profits to flatten out thanks to a more favorable sales mix which didnt happen since adjusted ebitda tumbled another  what management had to say while the company delivered mixed results overall management seemed pleased that they at least continued to head in the right direction ceo clay williams pointed out in the press release that the company posted its second consecutive quarter of rising revenues and its third consecutive quarter of rising adjusted ebitda furthermore he noted that the driving force behind that improvement was the north america land market which generated solid sequential improvements in profitability and are growing quickly this lifted national oilwell varcos consolidated mix of land revenues to  during the first quarter of  that shift toward land is worth nothing because the offshore market had dominated the companys sales for most of the past several years due to the strong drilling economics of north american shale plays though drillers are allocating most of their capital to those regions right now that increase in spending is having a noticeable impact on service companies halliburton nysehal for example saw a  uptick in its us land revenue last quarter which offset continued activity declines in international markets meanwhile baker hughes nysebhi ceo martin craighead noted that the onshore rig count increase in north america has been more robust than many had expected both companies expect this trend to continue which bodes well for national oilwell varco  international and offshore activities remain a different story however as halliburton president jeff miller noted we are in the midst of a unique and challenging cycle with very different dynamics between the north american and international markets i am excited by the activity i see in north america and confident in our ability to manage through any challenges in the international markets meanwhile craighead said that we expect there to be headwinds offshore throughout the rest of  that said as national oilwell varcos ceo put it the global market as a whole is slowly grinding higher which is a good thing after the challenges of the past two years  matt dilallo owns shares of national oilwell varco the motley fool owns shares of and recommends

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are
