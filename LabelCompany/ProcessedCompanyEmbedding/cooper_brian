your minimal viable product mvp eric ries and steve blank are one of the early adopters of instigating a minimum viable product mvp as part of the startup process blank defines a mvp “not always a smallercheaper version of your final product defining the goal for a mvp can save you tons of time money and grief” blank is an advocate for executing learn startup approach for almost a business one strategy behind building and utilizing a mvp is not to use too many resources eg time and money get your mvp built quickly so you can start testing your hypothesis using the new product     in  steve blank published why the lean startup changes everything in an issue of the harvard business review blank describes the learn startup provides an approach to starting a business less risky by emphasizing on experimentation and allowing your results to determine future decisions the legacy approach to starting a business through elaborate planning has taken a backseat to the lean startup approach blank says the lean startup movement has not yet gone mainstream and has stayed merely as a buzzword eric ries original definition of the mvp “is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning with the least effort” the benefit of a mvp is you can start learning about your product immediately and begin testing your hypothesis and measuring your results the results will provide insight on what areas of the mvp need some modifications made to it when you begin this process make sure the tests you are implementing are producing measurable matrices you want to be able to use your findings in a meaningful way to ultimately better your product     your new mvp is not something you will want to release to the general public it is a product that you will keep close to you give to every member of your team and maybe a few reliable customers to test this is how you can get reliable data and results the initial users will also be able to provide feedback on how to make adjustments and fix any bugs that they encountered roman pichler           steps to to follow when building your minimal viable product step  – create your vision what is the overarching vision and direction for your product step  – is it viable what do you need to have to test your idea to make sure it is viable step  – craft the prototypes brainstorm your ideas if you want some direction on brainstorming visit my blog post on brainstorming step  – test the prototypes you will need to start testing your mvp keep in consideration that you might have more than one mvp and will need to gather feedback on multiple prototypes step  – iterate now using all your data feedback and results you will want to go back with your team and start making iterations to your existing mvp         my challenge for you is to create a mvp ready set innovate…         please post your results on my blog post please tweet at

assault from coopers first trial and the two guilty verdicts for firstdegree intentional homicide the sexual assault charge was filed because cooper had sex with the bodybefore handing down the sentence judge d todd ehlers spoke of several things cooper said and did that he did not think spoke well of coopers characterthis included the spy cameras cooper used to record bromfield in door county and his plainfield home changing the password on his phone to bromfields birthday after they came to door county and coopers statement to the judge thursdaythe final character issue which i didnt know how this was all going to come down this afternoon mr cooper but i just heard your statement i listened to you read your poems ehlers said i didnt hear an apology to the family of alisha

sentencing hearing in door county circuit court july   samantha hernandezdoor county advocatehe also played a video that had been used in the trial of cooper hiding a spy camera in the bathroom garbage can of the hotel room that he and bromfield were sharingwhat i realized as i watched that during the first trial and i watched during the second trial is that thats the last view that alisha bromfield had as you were straddled over her body as you were strangling the life out of her ehlers said she looked up into your eyes just like you were looking into that garbage can and that just sends chills to me to the point that that is the last thing she sawbuy photo photo heidi hodgesfor the door county advocate the judge said several of the letters he received from bromfields friends and family referenced this very observationehlers also spoke about how the forensic pathologists description of bromfields body after the attack impacted him the doctors description included details of broken bones contusions and hematomas among other injuriesthat testimony from the doctor about the brutality of this assault and the ultimate murder of alisha and her child is extremely troubling to me he said i consider mr cooper the severity of the whole offense not just the strangulation but the assault you imposed on the body of alisha bromfield to be an extremely troubling factorbuy

cooper will also have to pay restitution of more than  district attorney raymond pelrine said the funds would be used for funeral expensespelrine told the press he felted vindicated after the

families he saidbuy photo photo heidi hodgesfor the door county advocate pelrine said he could not think of just one moment from the case that he would deem the most difficulti cant really think of one thing its been a slog i dont mean to put myself in any way in the position of the folks in the family i cant pretend to do that he said but all cases take a bit out of you a case that goes on for two years – two weeklong trials involving the deaths of a young woman and her unborn child and including the stakes of a person spending the rest of their natural life behind bars – so i cant think of anything that is more taxing more draining than thatforgivenbefore ehlers imposed the sentence he heard statements from several witnesses and cooper himself connie cooper spoke on behalf of her soni dont know what gods plan was for my son that day but i know god has forgiven him she said she read comments from coopers friends and his cousin reid paxson jr who had testified on coopers behalf during the trialat one point she told cooper she loved him and turned to the audience and said the same to stryker who was sitting with her husband and bromfields family and friendsbuy photo photo heidi hodgesfor the door county advocate cooper used his time to speak to read a written statement and two poems he wroteaccording to cooper he and bromfield enjoyed eating together taking work trips and going on everyday outings watching the show  and spending time with his dogwe both cherished all those days not only because of our dedication to our job but because we enjoyed each others company he readcooper said they also talked a lot of about bromfields pregnancyshe thanked me for all the support i had given her he said he praised her strengthcooper said it is extremely difficult for him to comprehend how such a horrific event had occurredalong with all the remorse regret and shame that streams down through my veins each and every day i have come to the assumption that there are really no words i can truly say to express how sorry i am that such tragedy did happen and the fact that i did cause the death of alisha and ava bromfield he said his voice breaking there was never even for a second any intention or plan of this i will show with my actions that i will eternally show with my love both of these beautiful womenvictim impactbromfields parents and one of her friends spoke to the judge about the impact of her deaththe emotional pain is difficult to describe  unless youve lost a child her mother sherry anicich saidduring their statements cooper looked redfaced and repeatedly dabbed at his nose and eyes he stared at the people as they delivered their statements he did not appear to look at his mother much during her statementthe family also showed a video
