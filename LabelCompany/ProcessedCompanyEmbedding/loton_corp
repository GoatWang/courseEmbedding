including growth of our business and cash needs of our business therefore we cannot at this time estimate the amount of the net proceeds from this offering to be used for any of the purposes described above our expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of any net proceeds pending use of the proceeds from this offering we intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments including short and intermediateterm interestbearing obligations investmentgrade instruments certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the us government while the broader market for live entertainment remains highly competitive the digital distribution of live and musicrelated video content is still a nascent market we believe live streamed music video content is the only remaining media genre without a dominant brand we believe there is a tremendous amount of high quality live music content available to be captured and produced but without a singular home for distribution and access by the public at large we expect to compete for the time and attention of our users with other content providers based on a number of factors including quality of experience relevance acceptance and diversity of content ease of use price accessibility perceptions of advertisement load brand awareness and reputation we also expect to compete for the time and attention of users based on the presence andor visibility of the livexlive platform as compared with other platforms and content providers that deliver content through internetconnected screens our competitors will include i broadcast radio providers including terrestrial radio providers such as clear channel and cbs and satellite radio providers such as sirius xm ii interactive ondemand audio content and prerecorded entertainment such as apple’s itunes music store and apple music rhapsody spotify pandora tidal and amazon prime that allow listeners to stream music or select the audio content that they stream or purchase iii other forms of entertainment including facebook instagram google twitter including periscope and yahoo which offer a variety of internet and mobile devicebased products services and content and iv promoters and producers of content on mobile online and arvr platforms such as redbull tv live nation tv and independent content owners to the extent that existing or potential users choose to watch satellite or cable television streaming video from on demand services such as hulu vevo or youtube or play interactive video games on their homeentertainment system computer or mobile phone rather than use the livexlive service these content services pose a competitive threat we may also face direct competition from other large live music event competitors with regards to online distribution of live music and musicrelated video content ticketing and sponsorship opportunities including from live nation anschutz entertainment group and livestyle formerly sfx furthermore there are many smaller regional companies that compete in the market as well company description we are one of the world’s only premium internet networks devoted to live music and musicrelated video content we intend to fill a market void by becoming a central content information and transaction hub for music consumers and industry stakeholders around the world we are geared for the digital generation and our mission is to bring the experience of live music and entertainment to internet users by delivering live streamed and on demand content to nearly any internetconnected screen our goal is to become a leading destination for premium music video content on the internet by continuing to aggregate and create our content including through strategic acquisitions we are also building a proprietary engagement platform that we believe will attract and retain users which we believe will allow us to collect valuable user data and monetize our growing content library through subscriptions advertising sponsorships and ecommerce since our launch in  we have sought to become the singular online destination for music fans to enjoy premium live performances from music venues and leading music festivals around the world as well as premium original content artist exclusives and industry interviews we have live streamed music festivals such as rock in rio outside lands music and arts festival and hangout music festival and our platform has featured performances and content from over  of the most popular artists in various music genres including rihanna katy perry metallica duran duran radiohead chance the rapper bruce springsteen major lazer and maroon  we have successfully distributed such content through our online platform and major third party distributors such as mtv international aol and complex media our content strategy includes continuing to aggregate live and on demand performance eg on stage sets and nonperformance eg behind the scenes interviews musicrelated video content from festivals clubs events concerts artists promoters venues music labels and publishers “content providers” acquiring and producing original musicrelated video content and curating existing online premium content in addition to acquiring andor partnering with third party content providers our digital studio lxl studios will develop and produce original musicrelated video content including digital magazinestyle news programming and originalconcept digital pilots and documentaries our platform engagement strategy is to build a compelling online experience for our users anchored by a pioneering website and our custom mobile application the “lxl app” the livexlive platform will offer access to some of the world’s leading music festivals and events with multiday and simultaneous multistage coverage unique concerts intimate performances and premium programming it will be fueled by our custom lxl app which we believe will drive  user engagement and data that we will be able to convert to earnings and cash flow through multiple potential revenue streams we intend to initially release the first version of the lxl app during summer  on the ios operating system in anticipation of rock in rio  we plan to release the android version of the lxl app and apple tv roku and amazon fire tv livexlive applications later in  by executing the above strategies we are creating a platform that is dedicated to live music and has the breadth and depth of content to reach and be relevant to a global audience of all ages  we were incorporated in the state of nevada on
