susquehannah is the third ratings upgrade since early december by wall street analysts sun trust robinson rates the stock a buy and credit suisse expects it will “outperform” the marketpayment processing companies are increasingly popular with investors because of an industry shift to emv technology or credit cards with chips instead of magnetic strips to carry personal dataa string of retail data breaches hastened the move to emv vantiv is gaining new clients because of it“emv helps to generate new sales because it really creates a catalyst for a broader conversation about security” vantiv ceo charles drucker told analysts oct  “within our merchant business we are processing emv transactions for several leading retailers and are now processing well over  million emv transactions a day”vantiv doesn’t break out revenue by security products but it’s clear they still represent a small chunk of total revenue in the quarter ending september  only  percent of vantiv’s  million in net revenue came from financial institution services a segment that includes security products most of vantiv’s revenue comes from merchant services which includes “all aspects of card processing including authorization and settlement customer service chargeback and retrieval processing and interchange management” according to the company’s most recent quarterly report to shareholderslasher sees plenty of room for vantiv to grow revenue from security products because of how it approaches the market instead of offering a onesize fits all solution vantiv offers a variety of products that are compatible with existing data systems whether a client is big or small advanced or primitive in its approach to data protection lasher can find a vantiv solution that makes consumer data more secure“we’re not going to sell you vapor ware” he said “we’re going to work with you to find what’s the best solution for you”vantiv uses tools like tokenization which means substituting sensitive customer data with information that is useless to data thieves and pointtopoint encryption which means converting credit card numbers to indecipherable code when a card is scanned“the reality is you can’t stop a hacker” lasher said “but what you can do is you can neutralize a hacker so when somebody hacks there’s no data there’s nothing there from a security perspective it’s all about shielding the liability protecting the customer information”other vendors take a similar approach but vantiv is winning converts the us postal service signed up last summer for a full range of paymentprocessing and security solutions trade publisher paybefore recently selected vantiv’s new omnishield assure as a winner in the “fraud fighter” category in its annual “pay awards”
