introduction of new onpatent drugs and facilitated by the removal of federal prohibitions against directtoconsumer advertising rates of autism increased by more than twentyfold largely because the loose diagnosis followed its becoming a prerequisite for extra school services rates of bipolar disorder doubled largely because of drug company marketing and rates of bipolar disorder in children

antipsychotic medication the elimination of the bereavement exclusion from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder was another particular concern threatening to label normal grief as a mental illness so while the task force was focusing on early detection and treatment frances cautioned about diagnostic inflation overmedication and crossing the boundary of normality besides the original complaint that the dsm task force was a closed process frances pointed out that they were behind schedule and even with a oneyear postponement they had to drop a followup quality control step he

author info about the book from the most powerful psychiatrist in america new york times and the man who wrote the book on mental illness wired a deeply fascinating and urgently important critique of the widespread medicalization of normality anyone living a full rich life experiences ups and downs stresses disappointments sorrows and setbacks these challenges are a normal part of being human and they should not be treated as psychiatric disease however today millions of people who are really no more than worried well are being diagnosed as having a mental disorder and are receiving unnecessary treatment in saving normal allen frances one of the worlds most influential psychiatrists warns that mislabeling everyday problems as mental illness has shocking implications for individuals and society stigmatizing a healthy person as mentally ill leads to unnecessary harmful medications the narrowing of horizons misallocation of medical resources and draining of the budgets of families and the nation we also shift responsibility for our mental wellbeing away from our own naturally resilient and selfhealing brains which have kept us sane for hundreds of thousands of years and into the hands of big pharma who are reaping multibilliondollar profitsfrances cautions that the new edition of the bible of psychiatry the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm will turn our current diagnostic inflation into hyperinflation by converting millions of normal people into mental patients alarmingly in dsm normal grief will become major depressive disorder the forgetting seen in old age is mild neurocognitive disorder temper tantrums are disruptive mood dysregulation disorder worrying about a medical illness is somatic symptom disorder gluttony is binge eating disorder and most of us will qualify for adult attention deficit disorder whats more all of these newly invented conditions will worsen the cruel paradox of the mental health industry those who desperately need psychiatric help are left shamefully neglected while the worried well are given the bulk of the treatment often at their own detrimentmasterfully charting the history of psychiatric fads throughout history frances argues that whenever we arbitrarily label another aspect of the human condition a disease we further chip away at our human adaptability and diversity dulling the full palette of what is normal and losing something fundamental of ourselves in the process saving normal is a call to all of us to reclaim the full measure of our humanity read more educator and librarian

méxico québec south africa united kingdom united states close the blog   am et  updated jul   dsm where do we go from here by allen frances  the publication of dsm is a sad moment for psychiatry and a risky one for patients my recommendation for clinicians is simple dont use dsm  there is nothing official about it nothing especially helpful in it and all the codes you need for reimbursement are already available for free on the internet or in dsmiv new codes will go into effect in oct   but these will also be free online spending  on the dsm white elephant makes no sense my advice to patients is more complicated and difficult to accomplish psychiatric diagnosis can be a turning point in your life leading to great good if accurate great harm if not take at least as much care in buying a diagnosis as when you buy a house or car become fully informed consumers knowledgeable enough to challenge doctors who make quick or questionable diagnostic calls never accept a diagnosis or take pills that are prescribed after a brief evaluation always be prepared to ask lots of questions and expect common sense answers if you dont get them seek a second opinion make sure the diagnosis fits well efore you buy it education and discussion will be the most powerful ways to mitigate the risks of dsm the more people know about psychiatric diagnosis the more likely it will be safe accurate and useful thats why i am so pleased that thomas nickel phd head of continuing education at alliant international university has set up a new interactive dsmooc web site that will undoubtedly become the focal point for diagnostic discussion and remediation check it out dr nickel writes now that dsm is about to be released it is time to determine how best to reduce if not entirely eliminate the risk that people will be misdiagnosed and improperly treated solutions will not come from one group or one project as one of what will hopefully be many initiatives we have developed a mooc massive open online conversation to bring together concerned clinicians and the public in order to give voice to the many different perspectives about psychiatric diagnosis our intention is to stimulate conversations that will lead to useful products people will find each other and work together to produce materials that can empower patients and influence practitioners suggestions for guidelines practice standards public policy and research will hopefully emerge certainly we will make every effort to facilitate this previous moocs have resembled traditional university courses with lectures and quizzes on technical topics like artificial intelligence or mechanical engineering until now moocs have not been closely linked to events happening in the world nor have they been a channel for real world action in this regard a mooc focused on dsm may be pioneering our mooc will consist of about  channels each one dedicated to one area of significant change or controversy in dsm each will provide background information videotaped discussions by leading experts and consumer advocates references links vivid portrayals of psychiatric diagnosis in films and fiction and an opportunity for discussion there are even google hangouts all set up for study groups to use our dsmooc should be equally interesting for professionals and consumers and will provide a uniquely open forum for interaction between them we hope that you will roll up your virtual sleeves join us at httpdiscussthementalhealthmanualcom  thanks dr nickel for generating this terrific idea and for all the work and attention to detail that must have gone into setting it up i have no doubt you will provide an enormously useful educational center and a much appreciated meeting place of ideas i can see only one possible consolation from the otherwise depressing dsm debacle  perhaps it will stimulate a vigorous discussion of the real strengths but also serious weaknesses of psychiatric diagnosis and treatment the more that clinicians and patients know about psychiatric diagnosis the greater will be its benefits the fewer its harms allen frances professor emeritus duke university more bipolar

dying at home there is no worse death than a hospital death dying well means dying at home this requires preparation and preparation requires recognizing that dying is a necessary and indeed desirable part of life preparing for a good death may be one of the best decisions you will ever make in your life whats in a name diagnosis and empathy are necessary partners in any therapeutic relationship

with the ability no longer to be overwhelmed by their illness the crisis of confidence in medical research randomized placebo controlled studies have been the gold standard in medical research but
