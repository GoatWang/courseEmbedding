of the total revenues for the year ended december    and  of the total revenues for the year ended december     we generate revenues from medicine revenue and patient services   medicine revenue from the sale of medicine is recognized when it is both earned and realized the company’s policy is to recognize the sale of medicine when the title of the medicine ownership and risk of loss have transferred to the purchasers and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured all of which generally occur when the patient receives the medicine   given the nature of this revenue source

social insurance are liable for the total cost of medical treatment   l for outpatient medical services revenue is recognized when the company provides medical service to the patient the company collects payment when the patient checks out from the hospital which is the same day the services are provided   l for inpatient medical services the company estimates the approximate fee the patients will spend in the hospital based on patients’ symptom this is when the patients check in to the hospital at that time the company collects the estimated fees from the patient and records the payment as deposits received   during the inpatient services period the company recognizes revenue when the patient service is provided and deducts the cost of service from the deposit received the company records these transactions based on daily reports generated by the respective medical department when medical services exceed patient deposits received the company records revenue and accounts receivable when the patient services are provided   when patients check out from the hospital the company calculates and determines the remaining deposit if any and refunds the unused portion of the deposit to the patients in the case where the patients have a balance in accounts receivable during the inpatient period accounts receivable are required to be paid in full at checkout   patients covered by social insurance will receive a portion or full medical services reimbursed or paid by the social insurance agencies via prepaid cards or the insurance claim settlement process    for the

deciding to invest in our company if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations for growth could be seriously harmed as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment   risks related to our business   if we fail to properly manage the employment of our doctors and nurses we may be subject to penalties including fines loss of licenses or an order to cease practice against our medical centers which could materially and adversely affect our business   the practicing activities of doctors and nurses are strictly regulated under the prc laws and regulations doctors and nurses who practice at medical institutions must hold practicing licenses and may only practice within the scope and at the specific medical institutions for which their practicing licenses are registered   in practice it usually takes four to nine weeks for doctors and nurses to transfer their practicing licenses from one medical institution to another or add another medical institution to their permitted practicing institutions some of our recently hired doctors have submitted applications to transfer their practicing licenses from their previous employers to our medical centers but have not finished the process we cannot assure you that these doctors will complete the transfer of their practicing licenses or the government procedures timely or at all our failure to properly manage the employment of our doctors and nurses may subject us to administrative penalties including fines loss of licenses or in the worst case scenario an order to cease practice against our medical centers which could materially and adversely affect our business                our business exposes us to liability risks that are inherent in the operation of complex medical equipment which may experience failures or cause injury either because of defects faulty maintenance or repair or improper use   our business exposes us to liability risks that are inherent in the operation of complex medical equipment which may experience failures or cause injury either because of defects faulty maintenance or repair or improper use extended downtime of our medical equipment could result in lost revenues dissatisfaction on the part of customers and damage to our reputation any injury caused by our medical equipment in our medical centers due to equipment defects improper maintenance or improper operation could subject us to liability claims regardless of their merit or eventual outcome such liability claims could result in significant legal defense costs for us harm our reputation and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   we primarily rely on equipment manufacturers or thirdparty service providers to maintain and repair the complex medical equipment used in our medical centers if any of these manufacturers or thirdparty service providers fails to perform its contractual obligations to provide such services or refuses to renew these service agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all we may not be able to find a suitable alternative service provider or establish our own maintenance and repair team in a timely manner similarly any failure of or significant quality deterioration in such service providers’ services could materially and adversely affect customer experience we also rely on both equipment manufacturers and our own internal expertise to provide technical training to our staff on the proper operation of such equipment if such medical technicians are not properly and adequately trained or if they make errors in the operation of the complex medical equipment even if they are properly trained they may misuse or ineffectively use the complex medical equipment in our medical centers such failure could result in unsatisfactory medical examination results diagnosis treatment outcomes patient injury or possibly death any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   financial projections included with this k may prove to be inaccurate   any projections are based on certain assumptions which could prove to inaccurate and which would be subject to future conditions which may be beyond our control such as general industry conditions we may experience unanticipated costs or anticipated revenues may not materialize resulting in lower operating results than forecasted we cannot assure that the results illustrated in any financial projections will in fact be realized by us any financial projections would be prepared by our management and would not be examined or compiled by independent certified public accountants counsel to us has had no participation in the preparation or review of any financial projections prepared by us accordingly neither the independent certified public accountants nor our counsel would be able to provide any level of assurance on them we cannot assure that we will be able to raise capital in this placement of common stock or that we will have sufficient capital to expand our business operations we cannot assure that we could obtain additional financing or capital from any source or that such financing or capital would be available to us on terms acceptable to us   we may not be able to compete against companies with substantially greater resources   the hospital industry is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify further in the future this is a very capital intensive business and companies with greater resources may have advantages that make our model weaker in comparison   our business is subject to various government regulations   we are subject to various federal state and local laws affecting medical products in china the state food and drug administration “sfda” ministry of health of the people’s republic of china “mohprc” and equivalent state agencies regulate healthcare services made by businesses in the offering of service which apply to us we are also subject to government laws and regulations governing health safety working conditions employee relations wrongful termination wages taxes and other matters applicable to businesses in general any such new regulation or the application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition                we cannot assure that we will earn a profit or that our products will be accepted by consumers   our business is speculative and reliant on acceptance of our brand name by local communities physicians patients and advertisers our operating performance is also heavily dependent on our ability to earn a profit from our services we cannot assure as to whether we will be successful or earn any revenue or profit or that investors will not lose their entire investment   we may incur uninsured losses   although we maintain vehicle insurance and basic chinese social insurances and related insurance we cannot assure that we will not incur uninsured liabilities and losses as a result of the conduct of our business should uninsured losses occur the holders of our common stock and debt could lose their invested capital   like most providers of medical services we are subject to potential litigation   we are exposed to the risk of litigation for a variety of reasons including service liability lawsuits employee lawsuits commercial contract disputes government enforcement actions and other legal proceedings we cannot assure that future litigation in which we may become involved will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operating results business performance and business reputation   we do not maintain any business liability insurance insurance companies in china offer limited business insurance products while business liability insurance is available to a limited extent in china we have determined that the risks cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to purchase such insurance product or medical malpractice liability or uninsured damage to any of our medical centers or the medical equipment in our medical centers could result in significant disruption to the operation of our medical centers and result in a material adverse effect to our business financial condition and results of operations   we may incur cost overruns in the distribution of our various services   we may incur substantial cost overruns in the distribution of our services unanticipated costs may force us to obtain additional capital or financing from other sources or may cause us to lose our entire investment if we are unable to obtain the additional funds necessary to implement our business plan we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital to successfully continue the implementation of our business plan if a greater investment in the business is required due to cost overruns the probability of earning a profit or a return of the shareholders’ investment in us diminishes   directors and officers have limited liability   our bylaws provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our officers and directors against claims arising from our activities to the maximum extent permitted by business laws of the state of florida if we were called upon to perform under our indemnification agreement then the portion of our assets expended for such purpose would reduce the amount otherwise available for our business we have no executed indemnification agreement   if we are unable to hire retain or motivate qualified personnel consultants independent contractors and advisors we may not be able to grow effectively   our performance will be largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization competition for such qualified employees is intense if we do not succeed in attracting excellent personnel or in retaining or motivating them we may be unable to grow effectively in addition all future success depends largely on our ability to retain key consultants and advisors we cannot assure that any skilled individuals will agree to become an employee consultant or independent contractor of jrsis our inability to retain their services could negatively impact our business and our ability to execute our business strategy from our past experiences we have never had difficulties hiring or retaining qualified personnel independent contractors or advisors                risks related to the company’s corporate structure   the failure to comply with prc regulations relating to mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by offshore special purpose vehicles may subject us to severe fines or penalties and create other regulatory uncertainties regarding our corporate structure   on august   the prc ministry of commerce “mofcom” joined by the china securities regulatory commission the “csrc” the stateowned assets supervision and administration commission of the state council the “sasac” the state administration of taxation the “sat” the state administration for industry and commerce the “saic” and the state administration of foreign exchange “safe” jointly promulgated regulations entitled the provisions regarding mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors the ma rules which took effect as of september   this regulation among other things has certain provisions that require offshore special purpose vehicles “spvs” formed for the purpose of acquiring prc domestic companies and controlled directly or indirectly by prc individuals and companies to obtain the approval of mofcom prior to engaging in such acquisitions and to obtain the approval of the csrc prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock market on september   the csrc published on its official website a notice specifying the documents and materials that are required to be submitted for obtaining csrc approval   the application of the ma rules with respect to our corporate structure and to this offering remains unclear with no current consensus existing among leading prc law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the ma rules we believe that the mofcom and csrc approvals under the ma rules were not required in the context of our share exchange transaction because at such time the share exchange was a foreign related transaction governed by foreign laws not subject to the jurisdiction of prc laws and regulations however we cannot be certain that the relevant prc government agencies including the csrc and mofcom would reach the same conclusion and we cannot be certain that mofcom or the csrc may deem that the transactions effected by the share exchange circumvented the ma rules and other rules and notices and that prior mofcom or csrc approval is required for this offering further we cannot rule out the possibility that the relevant prc government agencies including mofcom would deem that the ma rules required us or our entities in china to obtain approval from mofcom or other prc regulatory agencies in connection with jrsis’s control of jiarun   if the csrc mofcom or another prc regulatory agency subsequently determines that csrc mofcom or other approval was required for the share exchange transaction and or the vie arrangements between jrsis and jiarun or if prior csrc approval for this offering is required and not obtained we may face severe regulatory actions or other sanctions from mofcom the csrc or other prc regulatory agencies in such event these regulatory agencies may impose fines or other penalties on our operations in the prc limit our operating privileges in the prc delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from this offering into the prc restrict or prohibit payment or remittance of dividends to us or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and reputation as well as the trading price of our common stock the csrc or other prc regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us or making it advisable for us to delay or cancel this offering to restructure our current corporate structure or to seek regulatory approvals that may be difficult or costly to obtain   the ma rules along with certain foreign exchange regulations discussed below will be interpreted or implemented by the relevant government authorities in connection with our future offshore financings or acquisitions and we cannot predict how they will affect our acquisition strategy for example our operating companies ability to remit dividends to us or to engage in foreigncurrencydenominated borrowings may be conditioned upon compliance with the safe registration requirements by such chinese domestic residents over whom we may have no control   safe regulations relating to offshore investment activities by prc residents may increase our administrative burdens and restrict our overseas and crossborder investment activity if our shareholders and beneficial owners who are prc residents fail to make any required applications registrations and filings under such regulations we may be unable to distribute profits and may become subject to liability under prc laws   safe has promulgated several regulations including notice on relevant issues concerning foreign exchange administration for prc residents to engage in financing and inbound investment via oversea special purpose vehicles or circular no  issued on october   and effective as of november   and certain implementation rules issued in recent years requiring registrations with and approvals from prc government authorities in connection with direct or indirect offshore investment activities by prc residents and prc corporate entities these regulations apply to our shareholders and beneficial owners who are prc residents and may affect any offshore acquisitions that we make in the future                safe circular no  requires prc residents including both prc legal person residents andor natural person residents to register with the local safe branch before establishing or controlling any company outside of china for the purpose of equity financing with assets or equities of prc companies referred to in the notice as an offshore special purpose company in addition any prc resident who is a direct or indirect shareholder of an offshore company is required to update his registration with the relevant safe branches with respect to that offshore company in connection with any material change involving an increase or decrease of capital transfer or swap of shares merger division equity or debt investment or creation of any security interest moreover the prc subsidiaries of that offshore company are required to coordinate and supervise the filing of safe registrations by the offshore companys shareholders who are prc residents in a timely manner if a prc shareholder with a direct or indirect stake in an offshore parent company fails to make the required safe registration the prc subsidiaries of such offshore parent company may be prohibited from making distributions of profit to the offshore parent and from paying the offshore parent proceeds from any reduction in capital share transfer or liquidation in respect of the prc subsidiaries and the offshore parent company may also be prohibited from injecting additional capital into its prc subsidiaries furthermore failure to comply with the various safe registration requirements described above may result in liability for the prc shareholders and the prc subsidiaries under prc law for foreign exchange registration evasion   although we have requested our prc shareholders to complete the safe circular no  registration we cannot be certain that all of our prc resident beneficial owners will comply with the safe regulations the failure or inability of our prc shareholders to receive any required approvals or make any required registrations may subject us to fines and legal sanctions restrict our overseas or crossborder investment activities prevent us from transferring the net proceeds of this offering or making other capital injection into our prc subsidiaries limit our prc subsidiaries ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure as a result of which our acquisition strategy and business operations and our ability to distribute profits to you could be materially and adversely affected   under operating rules on the foreign exchange administration of the involvement of domestic individuals in the employee stock ownership plans and share option schemes of overseas listed companies issued and effective as of march   by the state administration of foreign exchange or safe circular no  the employee stock option plan or share incentive plan should be registered with the safe or its local branches and complete certain other procedures related to the share option or other share incentive plan through the prc subsidiary of such overseas listed company or any other qualified prc agent before such grants are made we believe that all of our prc employees who are granted share options are subject to safe no  in addition prc residents who are granted shares or share options by an overseas listed company according to its employee share option or share incentive plan are required to obtain approval from the safe or its local branches we intend to grant our prc employees stock options pursuant to an employee stock option plan we will request our prc management personnel directors and employees who are to be granted stock options to register them with local safe pursuant to circular no however we cannot assure you that each of these individuals will successfully comply with all the required procedures above if we or our prc security holders fail to comply with these regulations we or our prc security holders may be subject to fines and legal sanctions further failure to comply with the various safe registration requirements described above could result in liability under prc law for foreign exchange evasion and we may become subject to a more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities   risks related to doing business in china   we depend upon the acquisition and maintenance of licenses to conduct our business in the prc   in order to conduct business especially in chemical production activities in the prc we are required to maintain various licenses from the appropriate government authorities including general business licenses and licenses andor permits specific to our pharmaceutical product retail and distribution operations we are required to maintain valid safety service licenses and other relevant licenses and permits to conduct our activities the applicable licenses are subject to periodic renewal an application for renewal needs to be submitted at least  days before the expiration date and the extension will be approved if the applicant satisfies all applicable requirements and pays appropriate resource fee the prc government may amend relevant laws and discontinue approval of renewal of pharmaceutical related licenses further fees for such licenses may increase in the future our failure to obtain or maintain these licenses and any change of the relevant prc laws to our disadvantage will have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business and on our financial condition no assurance can be given regarding the timing or magnitude of these types of government actions or that the same will not have a negative impact on our operations                changes in current policies of the prc government could have a significant impact upon the business we conduct in the prc and the profitability of our operations   current policies adopted by the prc government indicate that it seeks to encourage a market oriented economy we believe that the prc government will continue to develop policies that strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and as a consequence business development in the prc will follow current market forces while we believe that this trend will continue we cannot assure you that such beneficial policies will not change in the future a change in the current policies of the prc government could result in confiscatory taxation restrictions on currency conversion or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises all of which would have a negative impact on our current corporate structure and our operations the prc laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain any changes in such prc laws and regulations may have a material and adverse effect on our business   there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of prc laws and regulations including but not limited to those laws and regulations governing our business and those relating to the enforcement and operation of our contractual arrangements at this time we believe that the relevant prc laws and regulations validate our current contractual arrangements and that our corporate structure is in keeping with such laws however no assurance can be given that prc court rulings to be decided in the future will be consistent with our current interpretations further new laws or regulations may be enacted which could have a negative impact on foreign investors we cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new prc laws or regulations may have on our business and no assurance can be given that our operations will not be affected by such laws andor regulations   the prc government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which companies in china must conduct their business activities   the prc only recently has permitted greater provincial and local economic autonomy and private economic activities the government of the prc has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the chinese economy through regulation and state ownership government actions in the future including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies could have a significant effect on economic conditions in the prc or particular regions thereof if this were to occur we may be required to divest the interests we then control in chinese properties any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and prospects   future inflation in china may inhibit economic activity and adversely affect our operations   the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion in recent years which has led to high rates of inflation and deflation this has caused the prc government to from time to time enact various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation while inflation has subsided since  high inflation may in the future cause the prc government to once again impose controls on credit andor prices or to take other action which could inhibit economic activity in china any action on the part of the prc government that seeks to control credit andor prices may adversely affect our business operations   a slowdown or other adverse developments in the prc economy may materially and adversely affect our customers demand for our products and our business   we are a holding company and of our operations are entirely conducted in the prc in addition all of our revenues are currently generated from sales in the prc although the prc economy has grown at a remarkable pace in recent years we cannot assure you that such growth will continue a slowdown in overall economic growth an economic downturn or recession or other adverse economic developments in the prc may materially reduce the demand for our products and have a materially adverse effect on our business              we may be restricted from freely converting the renminbi to other currencies in a timely manner   at the present time the rmb is not a freely convertible currency we receive all of our revenue in rmb which may need to be converted to other currencies primarily us dollars in order to be remitted outside of the prc effective july   foreign currency “current account” transactions by foreign investment enterprises are no longer subject to the approval of state administration of foreign exchange “safe” formerly “state administration of exchange control” but need only a ministerial review according to the administration of the settlement sale and payment of foreign exchange provisions promulgated in  the “fx regulations” “current account” items include international commercial transactions which occur on a regular basis such as those relating to trade and provision of services distributions to joint venture parties also are considered “current account transactions” other noncurrent account items known as “capital account” items remain subject to safe approval under current regulations we can obtain foreign currency in exchange for rmb from swap centers authorized by the government while we do not anticipate problems in obtaining foreign currency to satisfy our requirements however no assurance can be given that foreign currency shortages or changes in currency exchange laws and regulations by the prc government will not restrict us from freely converting rmb in a timely manner   governmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment   the prc government imposes controls on the convertibility of renminbi into foreign currencies and in certain cases the remittance of foreign currency out of the prc we receive all of our revenues in renminbi which is currently not a freely convertible currency shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or otherwise satisfy foreign currency denominated obligations under existing prc foreign exchange regulations payments of current account items including profit distributions interest payments and expenditures from the transaction can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the prc state administration of foreign exchange by complying with certain procedural requirements however approval from appropriate governmental authorities is required where renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the prc to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies   further the prc government may also restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions if the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands we may not be able to pay certain of our expenses as they come due   fluctuations in the exchange rate could have an adverse effect upon our business and reported financial results   we conduct our business in renminbi “rmb” thus our functional currency is the rmb while our reporting currency is the us dollar the value of the rmb against the us dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by among other things the political situation as well as economic policies and conditions on july   the prc government changed its decade old policy of pegging its currency to the us currency under that policy the rmb is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies this change in policy has resulted in an approximate  appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar between  and  however the prc government decided to repeg the rmb to us dollars in response to the financial crisis in  on june   china ended the pegging of the rmb to the us dollar allowing for a greater flexibility of its exchange rate there remains significant international pressure on the significant appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar to the extent any of our future revenues are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar we would be subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results since operating results are reported in united states dollars and significant changes in the exchange rate could materially impact our reported earnings   changes in prc state administration of foreign exchange “safe” regulations regarding offshore financing activities by prc residents may increase the administrative burden we face and create regulatory uncertainties that could adversely affect the implementation of our acquisition strategy   in  safe promulgated regulations which require registrations with and approval from safe on direct or indirect offshore investment activities by prc legal person resident andor natural person resident the safe regulations require that if an offshore company formed by or controlled by prc legal person resident andor natural person resident whether directly or indirectly intends to acquire a prc company such acquisition shall be subject to strict examination and registration with safe without such registration the prc entity cannot remit any of its profits out of the prc whether as dividends or otherwise as such the failure by our shareholders who are prc residents to make any required applications filings or registrations pursuant to such safe regulations may prevent us from being able to distribute profits and could expose us as well as our prc resident shareholders to liability under prc law                because our principal assets are located outside of the united states and most of our directors and officers reside outside of the united states it may be difficult for an investor to enforce any right founded on us federal securities laws against us andor our officers and directors or to enforce a judgment rendered by a united states court against us or our officers and directors   our operation and principle assets are located in the prc and our officers and directors are nonresidents of the united states therefore it may be difficult to effect service of process on such persons in the united states and it may be difficult to enforce any judgments rendered against us or our officers andor directors as a result it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in china in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the securities laws or otherwise even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind the laws of the prc may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers as a result of all of the above our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management directors or major shareholders compared to shareholders of a corporation doing business entirely within the united states   regulatory risks   state and local regulation   the company may be subject to the separate regulations pertaining to commercial private lenders specific property types or specific types of borrowers in each particular state county municipality or country the company may fail to comply with all of such regulations or may incur significant costs in complying with such regulations   usury laws   although the company intends for the company’s debt to be fully compliant with law the terms of such debts may be determined by a court to be usurious   risks relating to our common stock   we are an emerging growth company and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies our common stock may be less attractive to investors   we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies including but not limited to a requirement to present only two years of audited financial statements an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies and no requirement to seek nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements although some of these exemptions are available to us as a smaller reporting company ie a company with less than  million of its voting equity held by affiliates  we have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements  we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions  if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   pursuant to section b of the jobs act we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act this election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates the decision to opt out is irrevocable                because the worldwide market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates or public float is below  million we are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined under the exchange act some of the foregoing reduced disclosure and other requirements are also available to us because we are a smaller reporting company and may continue to be available to us even after we are no longer an emerging growth company under the jobs act but remain a smaller reporting company under the exchange act as a smaller reporting company we are not required to   · have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act and   · present more than two years of audited financial statements in our registration statements and annual reports on form k and present any selected financial data in such registration statements and annual reports filings made by the company on the edgar company search page of the securities and exchange commissions web site the address for which is wwwsecgov the public may read and copy any materials the company files with the sec at the secs public   because we are subject to “penny stock” rules the level of trading activity in our stock may be reduced   brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and if the brokerdealer is the sole market maker the brokerdealer must disclose this fact and the brokerdealer’s presumed control over the market and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account in addition brokerdealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction consequently these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity if any in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules if a trading market does develop for our common stock these regulations will likely be applicable and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares   finra sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock   finra has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer a brokerdealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in our common stock as a result fewer brokerdealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock reducing a stockholder’s ability to resell shares of our common stock     our insiders beneficially own a significant portion of our stock and accordingly may have control over stockholder matters the company’s business and management   the percentage ownership information shown in the table below is calculated based on  shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of december   we do not have any outstanding options warrants or other securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock                        amount and nature         title of       of beneficial         class   name of beneficial owner   ownership     percentage   common stock   junsheng zhang                  president chairman of the board     direct           common stock   sujuan peng                        direct           common stock   yanhua xing                        direct               all officers and directors as a group                as a result our executive officers directors and affiliated persons will have significant influence to   · elect or defeat the election of our directors     · amend or prevent amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws     · effect or prevent a merger sale of assets or other corporate transaction and     · affect tome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for vote   moreover because of the significant ownership position held by our insiders new investors will not be able to effect a change in the company’s business or management and therefore shareholders would be subject to decisions made by management and the majority shareholders   in addition sales of significant amounts of shares held by our directors and executive officers or the prospect of these sales could adversely affect the market price of our common stock management’s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price   the sale of securities by us in any equity or debt financing could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and have a material adverse effect on our earnings   we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock of which  shares are issued and outstanding our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock and to determine the rights preferences and privilege of such shares without consent of any of our stockholders any sale of common stock by us in a future private placement offering could result in dilution to the existing stockholders as a direct result of our issuance of additional shares of our capital stock in addition our business strategy may include expansion through internal growth by acquiring complementary businesses acquiring or licensing additional brands or establishing strategic relationships with targeted customers and suppliers in order to do so or to finance the cost of our other activities we may issue additional equity securities that could dilute our stockholders’ stock ownership we may also assume additional debt and incur impairment losses related to goodwill and other tangible assets and this could negatively impact our earnings and results of operations   if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our common stock our stock price and trading volume could decline   the trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock our common stock price would likely decline if analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline                if we continue to fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud in that case our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could negatively impact the price of our stock   effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud in addition section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  or the sarbanesoxley act requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting for all our current operations the process of implementing our internal controls and complying with section  will be expensive and time  consuming and will require significant attention of management we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future even if we conclude and our independent registered public accounting firm concurs that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness or a significant deficiency in our internal control the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied could reduce the market’s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price in addition a delay in compliance with section  could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions including ineligibility for short form resale registration action by the securities and exchange commission and the inability of registered brokerdealers to make a market in our common stock which could further reduce our stock price and harm our business   because we do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock holders of our common stock must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment   there are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends the florida revised statutes however do prohibit us from declaring dividends where after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution we paid dividends on our common stock in  we do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable future accordingly holders of our common stock will have to rely on capital appreciation if any to earn a return on their investment in our common stock   the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors   as a public company we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” and the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal accounting and financial compliance costs may make some activities more difficult timeconsuming and costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel systems and resources   in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we will need to expend significant resources and provide significant management oversight we have a substantial effort ahead of us to implement appropriate processes document our system of internal control over relevant processes assess their design remediate any deficiencies identified and test their operation as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business operating results and financial condition these efforts will also involve substantial accountingrelated costs   as a result of these and other factors our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts who choose to follow our company our failure to meet market expectations would likely result in decreases in the trading price of our common stock                item  properties   we lease our new hospital building from harbin baiyi real estate development co ltd which is owned by junsheng zhang a related party the property was leased from the related party by financial leasing the price of the leasing agreement referred to the local market

data   smaller reporting companies are not required to provide information required under this item   item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of such financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates including those related to useful lives of real estate assets bad debts impairment contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates the analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable sec regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events see “cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements” above   overview   harbin jiarun hospital company limited “jiarun hospital” was established in harbin in the province of heilongjiang of the people’s

provide services to our patients we also sell pharmaceutical medicines to our patients revenues from such sales are included in either our inpatient service revenues or our outpatient service revenues our revenues come from individuals as well as thirdparty payers including prc government programs and insurance providers under which the hospital is paid based upon local government established charges revenue from the sale of medicine is recognized when it is both earned and realized the company’s policy is to recognize the sale of medicine when the title of the medicine ownership and risk of loss have transferred to the purchasers and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured all of which generally occur when the patient receives the medicine patient service revenue is recognized when it is both earned and realized the company’s policy is to recognize patient service revenue when the medical service has been provided to the patient and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured                plan of operation   over the next twelve months we will concentrate on the following four areas to grow our operations   ● capital and funding – seek to obtain capital from all available sources to complete our hospital expansion and acquisition targets   ● advertising and marketing – work with several marketing companies to develop brand identity marketing materials and update our web site utilize all available marketing venues and public relations opportunities to promote the company and its medicine and services   critical accounting policies and management estimates   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with the united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation   principles of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries all intercompany

reported in the consolidated financial position within equity separately from the company’s equity and that net income or loss and comprehensive income or loss are attributable to the company’s and the noncontrolling interest                use of estimates   the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made however actual results could differ from those estimates significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances for receivables and recoverability of carrying amount and the estimated useful lives of longlived assets these estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable actual results could differ from these estimates   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the companys activities as described below   medicine sales   revenue from the sale of medicine is recognized when it is both earned and realized the companys policy is to recognize the sale of medicine when the title of the medicine ownership and risk of loss have transferred to the purchasers and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured all of which generally occur when the patient receives the medicine   given the nature of this revenue source of the companys business and the applicable rules guiding revenue recognition the revenue recognition practices for the sale of medicine do not contain estimates that materially affect results of operations nor any policy for return of products   patient services   in accordance with the medical licenses of jiarun the approved medical patient service scope of the company include medical consulting surgery obstetrics and gynecology pediatrics anesthesia clinic laboratory medical imaging and traditional chinese medicine etc   patient service revenue is recognized when it is both earned and realized the companys policy is to recognize patient service revenue when the medical service has been provided to the patient and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured   the company provides services to both patients covered by social insurance and patients who are not covered by social insurance the company charges the same rates for patient services regardless of the coverage by social insurance   patients who are not covered by social insurance are liable for the total cost of medical treatment   · for outpatient medical services revenue is recognized when the company provides medical service to the patient the company collects payment when the patient checks out from the hospital which is the same day the services are provided   · for inpatient medical services the company estimates the approximate fee the patients will spend in the hospital based on patients symptom this is when the patients check in to the hospital at that time the company collects the estimated fees from the patient and records the payment as deposits received   during the inpatient services period the company recognizes revenue when the patient service is provided and deducts the cost of service from the deposit received the company records these transactions based on daily reports generated by the respective medical department when medical services exceed patient deposits received the company records revenue and accounts receivable when the patient services are provided                when

advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability   asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities level  quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that is observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability level  prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable supported by little or no market activity   there were no transfers between level  level  or level  measurements for the years ended december   and    cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at amounts that approximate fair value because of the shortterm nature of these instruments the fair value of the

could differ from those estimates significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances for receivables and recoverability of carrying amount and the estimated useful lives of longlived assets these estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable actual

establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities level  quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that is observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability level  prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable supported by little or no market activity   there were no transfers between level  level  or level  measurements for the three months ended march   and    cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at amounts that approximate fair value because of

based upon local government established charges revenue from the sale of medicine is recognized when it is both earned and realized the company’s policy is to recognize the sale of medicine when the title of the medicine ownership and risk of loss have transferred to the purchasers and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured all of which generally occur when the patient receives

financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made however actual results could differ from those estimates significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances for receivables and recoverability of carrying amount and the estimated useful lives of longlived assets these estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable actual results could differ from these estimates   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured

and financial flexibility and to increase our visibility in the marketplace as of the date of this prospectus we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us from this offering however we currently intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering primarily for the expansion of the hospital including decoration of the new building expansion of medical facilities and purchases of new medical equipment we intend to purchase advanced medical facilities including t mri magnetic resonance imaging ultrasound mammography lightspeed vct disinfection and sterilization systems and so on although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any of the suppliers we will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this offering we estimate that we will receive approximately  in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of common stock in this offering based on an assumed public offering price of  per share and after deducting estimated offering expenses of   shares of common stock are issued and outstanding before the offering and  shares will be outstanding after the offering assuming all shares are sold however there is no assurance that we will be able to raise the entire price from the sale of stock by the company under this offering therefore the following details how we will use the proceeds if we raise only   or  of this offering respectively there will be   or  shares outstanding respectively offering proceeds  assuming  of the shares being sold however if only   or  of the shares being offered are sold the proceeds will be   or  respectively we estimate our total offering registration costs to be  if  of this offering is sold we estimate that this would provide sufficient capital to our growth operations and develop our business plan it may however place potential restraints on our ability to handle unforeseen expenses attributable to working capital and may require us to seek additional funding if only  of this offering is sold we estimate that this would provide sufficient capital to commence expand operations and development of the business plan but we would have no too much money to spend on medical equipment purchasing under this scenario we estimate that we would be able to generate enough revenues to sustain our business should we be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business we will have to find other sources of financing if we raise less than  we will have difficulty in implementing our business plan our expenses would be prioritized in order of importance and would affect how we allocate funds for developing the business if less than  is raised we would not be able to allocate any funds for expansion of medical facilities and purchases of new medical equipment if only  of the offering is sold we would still incur expected offering expenses of  which will have to be paid to maintain reporting status during the next  months we will not be able to apply funds to any other areas of developing our business such as expansion of medical facilities we will depend on other funding to complete the project such as loans from our officers or shareholders or from investors to pay  interests it will influence our next profit our current estimate of the use of the net proceeds from this offering is as follows approximate allocation of net proceeds  and amount of the securities offered by the company are sold                 decoration of new building     expansion of medical facilities  purchases of new medical equipment   total         currently we do not have any commitment for alternative funding alternative sources of capital such as bank or private loan may increase our financial expense and may decrease our net profit margin of  based on bank average interest rate in china the chinese private healthcare sector has become a major attraction for international investment target since  for example international finance corporation ifc has a usm joint venture jv investment with chindex and jp morgan’s usm jv investments in  class  hospitals in beijing and shenzhen chinese government had medical service reform policy from  but as researcher’s findings with unequal government policies from tax financial and expenditure aspects private hospitals are still facing difficulties to expand as such a reason private hospitals in china still appears small and highly fragmented however the biggest news on october   was new health service policyto promote health service industry development private hospital owners are anticipating equal pricing expenditure tax recruitment polices plus much more government incentives to private hospitals we are in direct competition with two governmentowned hospitals in the hulan district of harbin city china has a relatively underdeveloped healthcare infrastructure which results in significant unmet demand for healthcare services in china due to the rapidly rising demand for healthcare services and the underdevelopment of public medical services as well as favorable government policies encouraging private capital to invest in the healthcare services industry the number of privatelyowned medical institutions in china has experienced rapid growth in recent years key advantages to compete with two government hospitals are as follows  compared with a public hospital at a single location we are able to offer a more comprehensive medical serves at competitive prices and provide an affordable “onestop” service to our corporate customers who contract us to provide healthcare services to their employees and clients we are also able to provide our customers with satisfying experiences by providing customized services streamlined processes access to advanced equipment a comfortable environment customer servicesoriented staff and greater privacy characteristics which are highly valued by our corporate and individual customers  leading position in a fast growing market we were one of the earliest entrants into hulan’s private hospital market we were the largest provider of private medical services by revenue in hulan our operating history coupled with our established reputation provides us with advantages in retaining our leading market share compared with a public hospital at a single location we are the largest provider of private hospital by revenue in hulan  the private hospital market in china is expected to grow in the next three to five years due to the following factors  rising demand for customercentric professional services with broader and easily accessible locations attracting customers from the medical serves of public hospitals to private hospital  private hospital providers’ strong sales and marketing efforts  physician’s ability to practice in multiple locations under china’s healthcare reform plan announced by the prc state council in  physicians completely be allowed to practice on either a fulltime or parttime basis at different medical institutions including hospitals and clinics which provides sufficient supply of highlyqualified physicians to the private medical institutions like any system of course there are disadvantages  inequality which means that not every patient can benefit of private medical services therefore taxes are paid by private insurance companies if you need care after an accident or illness all individuals who have a healthcare insurance policy as a result of their work agreements are receiving care in a private hospital according to company policies  increased cost not every patient can afford to be treated in a private hospital especially students and older people a disadvantage can be the ignorance of people in terms of positive outcomes if people get better treatment in either public or private hospital these are characterized by a better system care which may contribute to a successful economy if people are treated effectively and quickly can lead to an improvement of work productivity in conclusion we believe the negatives of the private medical services are offset by the positive sides of it and anyone who needs care and better medical attention it is advisable to go for a private hospital difference and convenience compared to public hospitals can have a real impact on health and recovery
