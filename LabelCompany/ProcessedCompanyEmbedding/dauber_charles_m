m dauber president and ceo american electric technologies please go ahead sir charles dauber thank you kevin good morning everyone id like to welcome you all to american electric technologies first quarter  earnings call joining me today is our senior vice president and chief financial officer andy puhala for our call today im going to start with a review of our first quarter results and then ill andy walk you through some more financial details before i come back with some additional comments on our business well then move to a questionandanswer session coordinated by the moderator ill start by saying that i am pleased to report that the company reported consolidated revenues in the quarter of  million up  from  million in q although down slightly compared with q last year gross margins improved by  million in the quarter to  up from  in the fourth quarter but down slightly versus the  in q of last year consolidated income from continuing operations was  million for q which was a  million improvement over q but was down versus the  million in q last year the revenue increased gross margin increased and the consolidated income improvement were all directly related to the successful resolution of the operational execution new product introduction issues the company faced in both q and q of last year as we said in our q earnings call the company expected to be through those issues by the end of the year which we were and that for q we would be returning to more traditional gross margin levels which we have im proud of the team for the hard work and improving our operational execution from the resulting financial progress for the company ill now the call over to andy for some deeper financial discussion before i come back and provide more thoughts on our markets on our business so far in  andy puhala thanks charles as charles mentioned our consolidated revenues for the quarter were  million up  from q gross margins improved by  million to  and our consolidated income from continuing operations was  million for q a  million improvement since last quarter which demonstrated the execution issues in our us business are being addressed turning to our jvs the net equity income from our foreign joint ventures after expenses was essentially breakeven for the quarter our bomay joint venture in china had revenues of  million for the quarter up from  million in q but down  million versus q of last year bomay is an unconsolidated investment in our  share of bomays net equity income was  in the quarter due to chinese macroeconomic issues we expect bomay to remain profitable but dont expect it to return to  levels during the current year our joint venture miefe in singapore lost  on  million of revenue in q our share of the loss was about  in the quarter the southeast asia oil and gas market will be down in  based on the drop in oil prices but we are working closely with our joint venture partners sonepar to integrate miefe sales organization to build backlog and improve performance for the company into the second half of  net income attributable to common shareholders was  million for the first quarter or  per common share compared to a loss of  million or  per common share in the fourth quarter of last year but it was down from  million of profits and  of earnings per common share in q of  moving to the balance sheet and the cash flows we ended q with  million of cash on hand and  million of total debt which was unchanged from the end of last year our working capital needs increased during the quarter a result of higher revenue levels in large projects with long production cycles as well as timing on some payment milestones net cash used in operating activities during the quarter was approximately  million as we discussed last quarter we anticipate receiving our normal bomay dividend of approximately  to  million this quarter along with the smaller dividend from our singapore joint venture miefe turning to our backlog we ended the quarter with backlog of  million down from the near record backlog in q were  higher than the backlog at this same time last year particularly given the low oil price environment we believe this yearoveryear backlog increase shows the strong progress weve made in our sales and manufacturing capabilities and product offering since this time last year charles will provide some additional color on the territory and sector details for our backlog a little bit later in the call ill conclude my remarks with the comment on our segment reporting you may have noticed that we no longer show our tps and ei segments in the tables of our press release due to the sale of our american access technologies business and the reorganization of our business under our chief operating officer we have determined that our business now consisted a single segment and well not report multiple operating segments in the future earnings releases or in our public filings a related benefit of this change is we think this presentation of a single segment will improve the clarity and to ease of use of our financial statements for more information on our segment reporting please see this quarters q we will file on or before may  with that ill turn it back over to charles for some additional commentary and outlook on the business charles dauber thanks andy id like to now share with you all more information about our market sectors and our business as i discussed earlier we feel the company has successfully turned the corner with the operational execution issues we faced in the second half of last year i believe that at this time the company is best positioned for growth than weve been at any time in our history with the products the capacity and the team that really take our company to the next level of revenues and profits with that said the energy market that we participate in has continuingly experienced challenges related to drop in oil prices and i want to walk you through our market sectors and give you more color about our business lets start with our oil and gas market sector in q our oil and gas related business continues to be the primary revenue driver representing  or  million of revenue up significantly from the  million in q but down from the  million in q last year gross margins for the oil and gas business were  in q up from the negative  in q but down slightly from the  in q last year as ive highlighted in previous calls and as is described in the investor relations presentations available on our web site the company operates in three distinct parts of the oil and gas sector upstream which is the finding and the getting the oil or gas out of the ground which includes land and offshore drilling and offshore production midstream oil and gas which includes pipeline and gas processing and downstream oil and gas which includes refining petrochem and lg type applications another way to look at our oil and gas business is to separate our oilrelated projects from our natural gasrelated projects now a drilling rig power system doesnt necessarily care it’s drilling for oil or gas but the owner of the rig certainly cares we essentially have six distinct subsectors within the oil and natural gas markets that we participate in upstream midstream and downstream oilrelated and upstream midstream and downstream natural gasrelated projects when i look at our business in the oil and gas market sector i see that the vast majority of our recent projects are related to midstream and downstream natural gas or related to downstream oil none of which are directly tied to the oil prices in the quarter the company did receive notice that two oilrelated projects on our backlog were being canceled by our customers one was an upstream oil drilling rig power system from oil drilling focused customer and the other was a midstream oil punch line power system project where the customer cancelled two of the three pdc systems they had ordered from us as a result weve reduced backlog accordingly by  million as we grow the company our backlog continues to be lumpy our oil and gasrelated backlog for the quarter was  million down  million from the end of q but up  million from the  million in q of last year among our new oil and gas sector bookings was a multimillion dollar pdc project with a midstream focused engineering company for a cryogenic natural gas plants so during this low oil price environment we continue to focus on the natural gasrelated midstream and downstream opportunities and the downstream oil projects like refineries that are not yet tied to the price of a barrel of oil and at the same time were also focusing on upgrade and services work in the oil and gas sector this week in houston was the oil i am sorry right the offshore technology conference which is the largest oil and gas conference in the world i was pleasantly surprised with the attendance of the conference although the mood was slightly subdued there were actually numerous companies with projects that they described as funded even at current oil price levels that they were actively looking for solutions for the clear driver for the show was how to reduce operating expenses and make these oilrelated projects profitable at lower oil price levels at the show we announced a strategic partnership with a private company called flexgen power systems to bring energy storage technology to the drilling industry this flexgen hybrid generator product uses electrical storage to smooth out the power requirement spikes on a diesel or natural gas generator essentially how a hybrid vehicle operates for their original military applications and for the drilling applications this product is able to achieve a  reduction in fuel consumption for the operator which is a significant part of the operating cost of a drilling rig our agreement with flexgen is for mi business to sell to manufacture install and service the flexgen units in our oil and gas markets globally this initiative fits very well into our strategy of bringing innovative solutions into the energy markets and weve already had customer interest in this product ill update you on our upcoming call as things progress with this partnership one of our other key growth initiatives this year is our mi electric brazil subsidiary mi electric brazil had revenues of over  for the quarter which was essentially flat versus q as ever since our last earnings call brazils made significant sales progress that i want to share with you we are now on the approved suppliers list for over  companies in brazil weve received orders from many of our old customers from our former joint venture and several new customers as the old joint venture did not do business well we also correct that we are now on petrobras approved suppliers list and were receiving orders directly from petrobras for the first time although the brazil in macroeconomic environment is challenging we remain positive in our outlook for the rest of  and i look forward with sharing with you more updates from brazil and our upcoming earnings call so to summarize this part of the call our balanced approach to the oil and natural gas markets gives us counter cyclicality and even with the oil prices decline we remain positive about our opportunities in the midstream and downstream parts of this market to at least the end of  we believe the company is well positioned compared with our single sector oriented competitors to weather this oil priced drought driven storm facing the upstream market ill now turn towards our power generation distribution market sector which was  of our quarterly revenues of  million gross margins for the power gen business was  for the quarter up from  in q and up from  in q last year although power gen backlog is significantly down and remain highly lumpy we are quite positive about the significant increase in bidding opportunities coming from both current and new potential break in customers this comes from both engine generator related power generation opportunities as well as in increasing amount of based load combined cycle power plants and look forward to reporting on power generation progress in our upcoming call moving into our non energy related marine and industrial sector revenues were  million for the quarter compared with  million in q and  million in q last year our marine sector business is starting to see a slight increase in opportunities but the real story here is the growth in our industrial business which is coming from our growing penetration a top tier engineering procurement in construction firm which i started talking about last quarter in q we booked a multimillion dollar pdc project order for a chemical company to a first tier epc firm which was our first order ever with indiscernible chemical company in with that the top tier engineering firm all of this phased on the investment in sales and marketing and products that we began in  and continued in  we expect to continue to see further growth from this sector beyond those types of projects this year before we proceed with the qa session id like to conclude this prepared portion of my comments by again thanking our employees for hard work thanking our customers and shareholders for their support company is positive as we move forward in second half of  and look forward to continuing to execute on our strategy this concludes the prepared portion of my comments and ill turn the call over to kevin for the qa section of the call questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from greg ayers your line is now open greg ayers thanks and good morning charles i was wondering if you could just please repeat what you said earlier about the majority of projects right now are i think it was and i didn’t i was indiscernible are mid and downstream gas or downstream oil is that correct charles dauber yes so and youve seen this before right so you remember we do the upstream which is the drilling lane and offshore drilling and offshore production and then we do the pipelines now thats the midstream in the gas processing as midstream and the downstream as refining petrochem and lg so if i look at our business the majority of that business is coming from the midstream and downstream markets for both oil and gas but primarily its midstream and downstream natural gas and its all the way downstream which is refining type stuff of oil so were not seeing as much drilling business as we had in the last year because of oil prices greg ayers okay and could you just repeat it again so i can get this clear there are two pdc projects cancelled those are midstream oil pipeline power systems is that correct charles dauber we had an order for three pdcs from this one customer and they cancelled two of the three pdc is in that particular order greg ayers and that was  million with the backlog charles dauber it was that reduction in backlog that  million reduction in backlog let say twothirds of that was from those two projects and the remainder was from a weve received in order about a year ago for two drilling rigs and we delivered one and they can indiscernible for another drilling like power system so again those are both thats an upstream and midstream oil related project as we what saw the cancellations in nothing related in natural gas nothing related to downstream greg ayers got it and there is the pdc some sales and that was kind of primary issue from  the actual manufacturing flow of the pdcs slower than you would wanted would you say yes to the statement that the manufacturing which is in the slowdowns for pdcs are behind you at this time charles dauber so the answer is yes we believe those issues are behind us there was actually two issues from last quarter if you remember one was the introduction of variety of new products which was some switch gear in the pdcs and the other was just scaling up our volumes that would be able to handle this large amounts of projects and fair low and we believe weve solved both are the new product introduction issues including the pdcs and the ability to handle multiple large pdc projects in fair low so we feel really good about that going forward greg ayers understood and part of what youve been driving for all the last couple of years has been to increase these companies ability to execute larger ticket projects more or larger ticket projects at larger size to through the growth at the whole scope of the companys revenue based would you say that  are you seeing those larger projects come on to bid for you and are you seeing success in bidding on those largest sizes  if you look at what youve been working on say in the first quarter versus a year ago or two years ago charles dauber so ill just take at the easy answer which is if you actually go to our shop or youre going to see as multiple  foot long gigantic pdc is all going on at the same time weve never had that in our entire history as the company which is never happened right so those pdc is maybe anywhere between  million and  million size projects for the company traditionally have been operating at the  million to  million size i think so doubling size of the average selling price of these pdcs has happened thats already done so what the next phase is the one that actually get even more interesting which is as we increase the capabilities of our sales team and focused on these larger projects were starting to bid projects that are now  million  million  million project which maybe multiple pdcs from the same customer project or maybe so big that can actually do it in one pdc they have to break up in the multiple smaller assignments and so weve starting bidding those recently none of those were get the closed one where the other but were on the approve suppliers list and were bidding them and as customer is coming to the plant and see all these giant buildings going on in parallel they feel very very confident our ability to pull this project that so we feel confident about that continued growth with the sales team in placed and the operational capability including the oil price as well operator operator instructions you will go next to bill dezellem your line is now open bill dezellem the backlog ive recognized it is somewhat be but im curious to you view at as having seasonality in of some sort and its  whats the q seasonality charles dauber bill i dont know if i have a strong view of the seasonality of the backlog weve looked  we didnt going back and look at backlog over the last year but i think our markets are changing quickly enough but im not sure i can sort of make an interpretation of historical thing oil was at different position for backlog last year we had with two large offshore drilling projects there is not anymore large offer for drilling projects coming through this quarter or next quarter so its  i dont think that is actually a seasonality thing i think weve more based on where we are with our markets and where our sales team as in customer penetration versus any seasonality thing that being said there is probably some just market seasonality where id  thing will probably cool offer with the summer time indiscernible on the vacation but then attends to take backup but i dont know by of hard trend for you on that  i can really sort of step back and look that sorry bill dezellem no go ahead charles dauber i do think at the lumpiness of the business is going to still be an issue for us if you think about the question that craig just ask which is just were going after this larger projects the timing of the orders and just things  up and down but  we need to go continue to book business and were in  we need to continue to book more bill dezellem and actually on that note can you give any broad with characterization  are you feeling better about your market today not your positioning within but just the market space are not as good as given the energy prices charles dauber you mean versus our last call bill dezellem yes charles dauber i just walked through our sectors by  but i think i feel like better about the thrilling market just based on otc yesterday i don’t expect thats going to be a big source of growth rise this year but now we are forecasting that to be a down this year and i still think we see opportunities in the  sure this is and i think may be tinytinytiny of it better than i did a month or two ago but still significantly downwards a last year midstream is probably flat from where it was in  i think downstream is probably consistent and i felt good about the midstream and downstream parts of the market wealth is solidified or at least the last couple of weeks in other  range and unattractive in last week or two but i think as price is tend to stabilized people are able to move forward with projects slightly better in general im not bullish on oil related projects for the short term im still bullish on the natural gas related midstream downstream and oil related downstream project power gen i think the market is consistent so i feel good about that and i talked about the marine and industrial markets i think are probably flat so more of my optimisms coming from a markets for holding and our ability to succeed in those markets versus any market growth particular a dynamite bill dezellem i think thats great ill take you to my next question which is the execution issues that you have in the second half of last year did any of those linger or bleed into the first quarter charles dauber i would say the big project that we have that we talked about on last call are shift in q and so the  we had essentially three problem children project that i had mentioned we need to make sure we got all that on time we need to made to make sure it had good quality for breaking customers and we fit the bullet in q and q to make sure those pipelines so if i look at the gross margins for our business in q they are almost backup to the traditional gross margin levels and i think this is project issues are behind us thats not to say we are not going to have continued improvement or it can cause reduction inefficiency that are gone forever right but yes i think those acquisition is usually behind us bill dezellem great and finally you made some comments about brazil which are you going a bit more detail as seems as though the opportunity may be appearing larger there over the next couple of years and what you would have thought charles dauber but the part thats interesting about brazil is the macroeconomic is very its involving its challenging there is a bunch of stuff going around in brazil between the government and petrobras and the customers and so its almost like the environment is turning around but in the mean time our sales team and our operations team in brazil are quietly going about getting orders breaking in to customers working on project getting paid for those project so were still amount in brazil where  us going from zero to multimillion dollar year the share makes a difference gross limit thats a nice driver for our top line growth so i cant tell the size of the brazil market right now i can tell you the team weve got but together and the progress we making on the sale side which is obviously the front end to continuing the grow the business is making very good progress so we are very pleased with that so i think they are doing the right things i think that growth is also going to be lumpy not lumpy its more i think they are going to grow when the move to the plateau and then well grow and so i think its a start up right they are just as they break into these accounts and getting the new project and few things that will continue to grow the share bill dezellem and your comment that you have your first business with petrobras clearly the petrobras’ size relative to your size would imply that that they could do a lot of business to be relative to your revenue and rate talk with us little bit about how you foresee that relationship developing charles dauber weve done work indirectly for petrobras for years because we work for the drilling contractors that doing work for petrobras that we weren’t unknown to them but this isnt on the approved suppliers list for petrobras and it built direct relationships with them they have an awful lot of work to do they are excited about our history what we bring to the table they know about our quality and theres we see lots of opportunities this is remember  this is the brazil entity right now is focusing on what we called ei services which is electrical services deals services motors generator repair all the things that mainly to do their fleets operating im not even talking about the future product opportunities which are still to be determined based on the brazil local contempt rules and how they end up with the capital planning on the next six or twelve months as of which we think there is very interesting opportunities for the services part of our business which are nice projects that we can continue to grow and execute those on continued growing and getting pace from that operator well take our next question from george cowman your line is now open unidentified analyst good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my calls great color on brazil couple of questions you had mentioned on your last call that youre on your way to indonesia could you give us a little bit more color on that smaller joint venture there what the growth prospects are and also talk a little bit about the situation in bomay china i think you mentioned also that  that was expanding and last but not least the recently announced joint venture what type of revenue opportunities you see in that field and could that be expanded also internationally charles dauber let me go through a couple of things so if i tell i was going to indonesia that was a mistake i actually went to hong kong but that meeting in hong kong was for our joint venture in singapore so thats probably why i got confused whatever i said in the last call so the singapore joint venture which is called miefe as i said in the last call i was on my way for a board meeting as andy mentioned and this is held in his portion of the call the south east asia market is heavyheavy oil related thats a shipyard and things like that that business is down right now if you remember the opportunity that we have us with our new  the acquirer of our previous joint venture partner theres a company called sonepar and that veryveryvery large electrical distributor so our plan with sonepar is to beef up the sales resources in the joint venture and to leverage the sonepar reach across the entire asia pacific region and go get those revenues of that joint venture up and where we need to be independent again of the price of the barrel of oil so its extending the reach beyond singapore and indonesia into the rest of the region and being able to deliver growth which is what that crude drilling use to indiscernible despite showing some profitability so i would just say stay tuned on the singaporean opportunity i think we mentioned they were about a  million in revenue and slightly below breakeven they got to get more business in there and there fixed costs covered so thats the singapore indonesia and sorts turned out that meeting at hong kong on to china so china macroeconomic issues are going to be a big story for bomay for this year so our bomay joint venture in xian operationally doing well they know how to make money but when the chinese government is not investing money in new oil and gas infrastructure in china that is a significant potential impact on bomay and turns out bomays business is split between the business that actually stays in china when they shift drilling rigs to cnpc some stay in china and a bunch go outside of china to leverage chinas selling stuff to right and so i believe this year well see the majority of the opportunities for bomay come from other markets whether thats the middle east or south america or other places that theyre selling to but in general china is down and bomay will be down this year versus last year and the year before the last question you asked was about  i think about flexgen yes so flexgen is not a joint venture its just a strategic partnership in this partnership were going to basically take their products that they originally developed for military application and bring them into oil and gas market so their experts in the technology or experts in the market and the manufacturing and the sales on the service and the packaging and other things that require to make these successful in offshore drilling rig where youve salt water issues or in the desserts although indiscernible have some experience in the desserts because they have a lot of products to believe in ftns stand with the military so but all role is basically taking this technology in bringing indiscernible oil and gas market i think its too early to sort to have a sense on revenues and profits and things like this george just fits really well into our focus right so think about it were not just a supplier of generic electrical equipment in the energy industry were doing very optimized thing that really take advantage of our technology and expertise in these applications and thats the sense of what were doing here so its very cool technology its almost like the way a hybrid vehicle works you step on gas you accelerate now thats where the gas consumption happens same thing in the drilling rig they start tripping the rig or they start doing more drilling that has a big power requirement this technology can smooth out that power requirement and we significantly want to reduce indiscernible out of fuel thats used which is a huge cost savings for the operator and thats where the drilling market specially for oil is all about right now you liked this because it helps operators save money and it makes an upgrade or as a new build and makes the drilling contractors have a more marketable leg they can take this rig with the technology on it to their perspective investments and say we will help lower you cost and thats a very powerful statement indiscernible unidentified analyst so this market would this be considered as retrofitting existing rigs or build into  as a new feature into the new more efficient drilling rigs that are coming to monitor charles dauber its both and so our particular existing rigs and want to reduce operating expenses its offered as an upgrade and well come in and well sell it we wont stall it well connect it indiscernible if youre building new rig then you can actually tie that to our ac vfd systems and well deliver in entire integrated solution with the our product and flexgen integrated together all try to manage under our drill system automation which is a very good start people are very very interested and we think there is a good opportunity unidentified analyst are these guys looking at houston too or somewhere else charles dauber they have multiple facilities one of them houston is headquarters for this purpose in houston yes its a private company andy puhala and they have been indiscernible charles dauber several years the technology originally was deployed in the military if you understand how the military fuel works saudi and afghanistan we may pay  for a gallon of diesel but for the military theyve got a literally get that gallon of diesel feel to run the generators in these remote areas whether fields or wherever theyve shift into  its about  and there is a huge cost of life many many many people of actually died i think the number is  people have died delivering fuel to these army and military forces in the last several years so this is where that technology comes from as reducing the fuel expense and reducing the risk the soldiers so they can focus and nothing into focus on were now taking at the oil and gas market unidentified analyst then maybe one last thing on the brazil  revenue this quarter can you give us like a number youve mentioned earlier could be several million what are you guys capable of  how many books youve on the ground in your brazil subsidiary andy puhala were about some between  and  people in brazil its the numbers its not an exact  i dont have an exact amount of headcount so you have the team can support projects its interesting because we have both of factory i called shop based organizations so we get motors and generators and transformer something and weve a different work on customer project offshore on drilling rigs and another floating production and storage upload applications we can handle more and we obviously have the verdict skill about further when we had that the original joint venture and were doing those large projects were at  million a year revenue size we had  people working on construction projects at any one time we can go get those people back when we get the business and unidentified analyst okay do you have your own shop there to manufacture or are there alternate in houston in shift over there andy puhala so we have two shops in brazil that are service shops one in rio and one macaé those shops have some manufacturing capability but if it something sophisticated were going to build it in houston and shift  and that has more to do with local contact requirements and where does brazil we want buy from us import duties et cetera but the focus for that group right now is shop services and field services including construction and then overtime adding more products to the next unidentified analyst okay so the brazilian real currency fluctuations are not really affecting that much even though a lower real is more advantageous for you andy puhala its a mix charles dauber it affects us but lot of our revenues of real that nominated and we have a large account based real as nominator so its bit of natural hedge looking into that business but certainly to the extent that  our investments are there and transactions between the us and brazil that they don’t impact unidentified analyst last question on the acquisition front any ideas any looking going on about maybe doing one or the other acquisition to add to the revenue side charles dauber when id say and that is weve talked about this for several years as were always on to look out for acquisitions we think that there is that now weve got the sales team in place and weve got the production capacity in place weve got the management team in place and we think were able to handle larger acquisition were very conscious of value in our market and so we  last year we saw couple of things and we didnt like the valuations and so we didnt pursue them i think as oil prices stay where they are and well start to see some interesting things pop up and so were interested were malleable but were very very focused on making sure we get the right strategic accretive acquisition for our shareholders so i think thats a way i think about it operator and it appears we have no further questions at this time charles dauber okay i thank everybody for participating in the call and well talk to you all again soon thank you

quarter  earnings call joining me today is our interim cfo mark vise for our call today im going to start with a review of our third quarter results and mark will walk you through some additional financial details and later in the call ill come back and provide more thoughts on our markets and our business thus far in  and the outlook for the remainder of the year we’ll then move to a questionandanswer session coordinated by the moderator aeti’s consolidated revenues in q were  million up  versus q but were down slightly from the  million in q of last year gross profit margin for the quarter increased to  compared to  in the second quarter of the year and was up significantly compared to the  gross profit margin on the third quarter of last year if you’ll remember our gross margins in the second half of  were negatively impacted by project cost over runs related to a significant increase in large pdc projects and several simultaneous new product introductions all of which were substantially completed by the end of q  as a result of the increased revenues and increased gross margins the company reported its third consecutive quarter of profitability in q with net income from continuing operations of  which was down from the  in q but up from a  million loss last year in q i’m pleased that in this current oil and gas market environment that we are able to continue to maintain profitability and we’ll discuss further details as i continue through our results i will now turn the call over to mark for some additional financial discussion mark vise alright thank you charles continuing where charles left off fully diluted earnings per share for the period were  per common share compared to  in q of this year and a loss  in q of  our ebitda nongaap measure for the quarter was  down from  in the second quarter but significantly better than the negative  million in the third quarter of last year the yearoveryear increase being driven by high gross margins from  or higher gross margin from increased efficiencies at our beaumont plant that charles mentioned earlier moving to the balance sheet and cash flow we ended q with a strong cash position of  million and  million of total debt our working capital remained decreased during the quarter a result of lower revenue levels and the timing of certain payments from milestone payments from our customers as a result of the reduced working capital requirements and strong collection activity the net cash generated from operating activities during the quarter was approximately  million and for the first nine months was  million we believe our existing cash position working capital and credit facility combined with operating earnings will be sufficient to meet working capital needs for the next  months with that i will turn it back over to charles for some additional commentary and outlook on the business charles m dauber thanks mark i’d like to now share with you more about our market sectors in our business ill start with our oil and gas market sector as i have highlighted in previous calls the company operates in three distinct parts of the oil and gas sector upstream which is the finding getting the oil or the gas out of the ground including land and offshore drilling and offshore production midstream oil and gas which includes oil and gas pipelines and gas processing plants and downstream which includes refining petrochemical and lng type projects revenue in this sector was  million in q up  versus q and up  versus q last year our sector gross margins for the quarter were  up an additional  from the  in q further reinforcing at the operational execution issues we experienced in the second half of last year are behind us as you all know in the first three quarters of  the land and offshore drilling market experienced significant decrease in activity primarily related to the continued drop in oil prices that began in late  we did start seeing land drilling project opportunity again in the second quarter and booked and shipped land drilling projects in q for noncontinental us deployments the company has seen good success in the midstream and downstream related of the oil  gas sectors so far in the year and has been able to sustain revenues and margins through q with that said we definitely saw a slowdown in the midstream part of this sector in q as pipeline and natural gas processing plant orders slipped out of q into q causing a reduction in our quarterending backlog in addition we had a  million cancellation of a previously booked large oil related land production project that negatively impacted our back log for this sector as well based on the project cancellation and the delayed midstream orders our oil  gas related backlog for the quarter was  million down from  million at the end of q moving to our international operations which are primarily oil  gas related mi electric brazil if you remember is focused on providing electrical services primarily to the brazilian land and offshore oil  gas markets which still need services even with the drop in oil prices this focus means that although the brazilian macroeconomic environment remains challenging we remain positive in our outlook for continued growth for mi electric brazil into  mi electric brazil generated  of revenue in the quarter down  from q partially due to exchange rate fluctuation and partially due to delays in several service projects gross margins for mi electric brazil in the quarter were down to  which resulted in mi electric brazil essentially breaking even for the quarter which was decline versus their profitability in q we remain positive about the brazil longterm outlook as the team continues to increase penetration of brazilian nondrilling customers and continue to progress with projects directly with petrobras in their landbased downstream operations turning to our international joint ventures equity income from the two joint ventures net of jvrelated expenses was about  for the quarter our bomay joint venture in china had a good quarter with revenues of  million which was flat compared to q but up significantly from the  million in q last year we recognize our  share of bomay’s profit as net equity income which was  in the quarter up from the  in q and up slightly from  in q last year as youre aware the chinese economy remains down and we expect to see bomay remain flat at this level into  and on the side we also don’t expect a recent devaluation of the chinese currency to have a material impact on our financial results our joint venture miefe in singapore returned to a loss in q and  million of revenue our share of that loss was  in the quarter as we indicated in last quarter’s call the southeast asia oil  gas market was also down this year based on the drop in oil prices miefe is seeing an increase in opportunities for the downstream and other nonoil  gas sectors being brought in from the new salesmen that we hired earlier in the year although the short term outlook for miefe is challenging were working closely with our joint venture partner sonepar to manage costs and are working on additional plans to improve performance with the company heading into  taking a step back as we head into  the company as a whole still sees opportunities throughout the oil  gas sector in the upstream portion of oil  gas we have seen increased opportunities for international projects in places such as the middle east and south america that we are pursuing strongly but in general we remain bearish for the market for new land drilling rig projects for the continental us through the end of  i believe the biggest opportunity for growth in the upstream market will come from the services for existing deployed rigs we can help our customers reduce costs and keep capital spending low for land and offshore drilling rigs during this market downturn weve also started seeing upgrade opportunities as well for the upstream part of the market primarily for international offshore rigs were also hopeful that our partnership with flexgen to deploy energy storage systems that reduce operating costs by reducing fuel expenses for drillers can bear fruit in  we see opportunities in the midstream market for natural gas transportation and gas processing but believe that market will be flat to slightly down as we head into  we do see continued growth opportunities in the downstream part of the oil  gas industry which includes the refineries petrochemical facilities and lng plants and weve positioned the company’s sales teams appropriately as part of our focus on building market share in the midstream downstream and also the power gen factor we recently announced our new intellisafe medium voltage arcresistant switchgear product line at the  petroleum and chemical industry committee conference that’s known as pcic in houston intellisafe is the world’s safest arcresistant switchgear product and enables customers to maximize protection against arc flash hazards and improved power reliability intellisafe addresses key challenges with existing solutions on the market and meets or exceeds all industry specifications including the process industry practice stacks known as the tip stacks intellisafe is also designed what is called the industrial internet of things where customer get complete visibility as to not only the power going through the systems with the status of all aspects of the system itself this information comes from sensor spring throughout the equipment which then transmit data back to the operator for predictive analysis enabling higher uptime and increased operational visibility since the end of the quarter and the announcement of the product we booked a large pdc project for a large midstream company for intellisafe and with more opportunities in our sales prospect list we are working with customers to close the other major thing we did to accelerate our sales efforts was to bring on mark haubert as our new senior vice president of sales and marketing mark has over  years of sales leadership in the energy industry and has successfully lead sales and marketing teams at energy services companies focusing on the same midstream and downstream markets we focus on his specialty is improving sales processes creating strategic account penetration programs and building true partnerships with customers we are excited to have mark on board and i look forward to sharing more about our continued sales progress in the market in future calls ill now turn to our power generation distribution market sector which had revenues in q of  as i have mentioned before this sector has been quite lumpy for us which is demonstrated by the  million in backlog and that we booked in q there is order for natural gas turbine power generation projects with a major turbine oem customer and are expected to ship in the latter part of this year and on into  we have really seen an increase in opportunities for natural gas based power generation projects and a positive on growth in this sector in  and in fact since the end of the quarter we booked an additional  million in power generation related orders for  delivery moving into our non energy related marine and industrial sector q revenues were  million flat with q but down from  million in q last year will be the large chemical plant project that was not oil related  oil and gas related project backlog for this sector was up  million to  million just like the refining and petrochemical markets we believe  will continue to see opportunities in the non oil and gas chemical markets throughout the year especially as the company further penetrates the large epc customers we have been targeting who focus on these large chemical projects if i add the backlog of all those sectors together total backlog for the company exiting the quarter was  million down from the  million in the second quarter reflective of this reduced backlog the company has implemented several strategic initiatives to manage through this market environment we’ve already focused on improving our operations to increase margin and to make sure we can continue to adhere to tight project schedules so we can increase customer satisfaction we believe we’ve adjusted our pricing to aggressively maintain appropriate business levels where we are well positioned to win orders in this tough market in addition to its focus on operational improvements and strategic sales and marketing we are also focused on aggressively managing cost and cash we are taking actions including spending cuts and several reductions in force and we’ll continue to evaluate our cost structure and make further adjustments as required we’ve improved our working capital position to active management of our balance sheet to maximize our financial position and we feel confident about our cash position going forward to summarize my comments first i am pleased the company made money in q q and q given this challenging market environment and i’d like to express my thanks to the members of the team that made that happen second the company is uniquely positioned to be the premier turnkey supplier for power delivery projects for our customers and we can offer our custom design power distribution and conversion systems power distribution centers automation systems and ei services to the market the launch of intellisafe is actually really important for the company it gives us a critical product with a competitive advantage that when combined with our custom turnkey power delivery solution set enables us to take market share from our larger competitors in the market third the operational infrastructure we deployed last year is now place to further improve productivity and gross margins going forward as evidenced by our increased gross margin percentage in q even in the face of a very competitive market with pricing pressures despite the challenges certain segments of our market are experiencing we still expect demand for our products to increase over the longterm and believe weve positioned the company well for market success in the future before we proceed with the qa session i’d like to conclude the prepared portion of my comments by thanking our employees for their hard work and our customers and our shareholders for their support this concludes the prepared portion of my call and i’ll now turn the call over to debbie for the qa section debbie questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions we’ll take our first caller greg ayers hi charles this is greg ayers at singular research good morning charles m dauber hi greg greg ayers so looking at the overall business levels it’s clear this slow down has kind of been a big hit to  the energy sector slowdown just continues to be a big hit to the revenue line you had the one large land deal  million deal pulled out of backlog that was cancelled as you look at your backlog now and that was obviously a very large item as you look at your backlog right now is there any single backlog item that would be that material within the existing backlog carried over into q that we would have to worry about getting cancelled or is it more granular than that charles m dauber no so i think theres two things one is theres no single project in backlog that’s a same size right as the first blush but second is that was like the last big real related backlog thing that we had and so everything else that’s in backlog is all natural gas infrastructure power gen weve got some marine stuff in backlog some chemical things nothing else oil related frankly greg ayers really that’s how bad the oil market is oh boy charles m dauber but you have to remember – but greg you have to remember that the drilling the landdrilling projects those are normally shortercycle projects so in q we booked some orders that shipped in q for some land drilling rigs greg ayers yes right charles m dauber so there is some – theres some of those things but nothing on the magnitude that this project was greg ayers understood understood part of your strategy has been and that was part of the beaumont expansion again to position you to be able to compete for larger size contracts which there was to open up you up to new markets by being able to build larger size projects for the theoretically larger customers or customers with bigger demands do you see the bidding availability to bid on those larger size contracts still in place at this time or has that market kind of gone away for now charles m dauber no i think that market is still there the – if i think about what were bidding now the projects were bidding for the midstream market those range from  million to  million so those are nice sized projects for us those maybe singlepdc projects some of them are multiplepdcs but just on a single project the midstream stuff is not at that  million level where weve seen the larger projects i’ll call the  million plus is in the downstream part of the market so that’s the refining or the chemical parts of the market and in the power generation parts of the market and that’s what the team has been seeing in terms of larger projects recently we had last year we had in  we had two large offshore oil drilling projects and those were  million a piece plus the oil market declined those weren’t replaced by other large offshore drilling projects at the time alright so that’s why you are not seeing a bunch of large oil related projects at this point in the backlog greg ayers understood i think early in the call you said that you booked and shipped land drilling projects in q that were shipped to international markets charles m dauber actually what i said was non continental united states or i think that one went to alaska greg ayers okay understood charles m dauber most of what the bidding opportunities we’re seeing for land drilling are international oriented nothing in the united states continental us greg ayers okay i am curious i am trying to understand why the international markets would have better opportunities for land drilling than the us when it’s a global product with a global price is that a fair question charles m dauber yeah yeah i think my personal opinion is that in the lot of the international markets they have to keep drilling right there is no question the tax environment of those countries is dependent on drilling and so whether oil is at  or  ph they still got to keep drilling to keep tax revenues coming into their markets that’s number one so those markets  a lot of the international markets were not as quick to upgrade their rigs so what they are doing now is they are basically trying to figure out how do they get access to these projects that they’ve got in place like the middle east or south america as cost effectively as possible and so that’s why i think that we’re seeing some increased opportunities there when those opportunities will close and continue to close i cant tell right but we’re certainly seeing increased international opportunities in the last quarter or so greg ayers good good before i forget can i ask to repeat the number you gave for the marine sectors revenue for the quarter charles m dauber if you remember the three sectors is oil and gas that’s power gen and distribution and then what we call the marine and industrial market for the industrial part meaning the nonoil and gas influx deal or water waste level or chemical so that marine and industrial sector revenues in q were  million greg ayers got it understood looking at brazil you mentioned its down a little bit from the second quarter partly the currency you know on that story and then you said some delays is your brazilian business and i guess i have asked this question on previous quarters but i guess i have to continue asking because the situation in brazil continues to be in the headlines the government  the stability of the government has been called into question with not to keep the present leadership and such and petrobras has been a kind of a domestic disaster are the problems that they are seeing domestically with petrobras and then the politics affecting the volume of business that you could bid on or you still feel yourself as though you are kind of immune to it because you are providing a maintenance type level product that they are going to buy anyway charles m dauber so i guess i would say that there is really three things that are going on in brazil that are impacting business the stability of the government which actually is tied to petrobras in terms of the car wash scandal but the other big thing from brazil is the price of oil right and brazil in the presub ph that was a big driver for their big spending plans over the last four or five years so the brazil the strategy for brazil market is that look we are doing this fundamental maintenance services and electrical services and they still need that whether it’s the drilling rigs that are still there it’s the land projects petrobras on the refinery side we are doing petrobas there so we’ve got enough business to basically continue with our growth path for the services part of the business but whats happened is that the upswing in terms of these larger new projects that still is not happening and we have very little visibility into when we would start seeing things like new capital projects being deployed in brazil so we can start doing things like the construction projects that are joint venture down there we are used to doing these sort of capabilities in house to handle right so i think we got the maintenance we feel like that business continues to make progress in the market right but the sort of the upswing in the growth the strong upswing that’s going to be challenging until the government and petrobras figures itself out greg ayers so between the government and the price of oil charles m dauber and the price of oil greg ayers the capital spending side of the brazilian business will be dormant but the maintenance side continues charles m dauber that’s right so we still expect growth based on just frankly our penetration in the market weve been as an entity in the market for i think four quarters now right so the business is – has broke even this quarter but let’s say in general doing what they’re supposed to be doing which is generating incremental revenue for the company for aeti corporate generating good gross margins because it’s all services there which helps the company and positioning ourselves with these companies for the longer run where the capital projects come back but were chunking away in the mean time greg ayers understood understood if i could ask about the bomay business in china its – the first quarter this year was obviously very – first two quarters were very down versus last year but the business has been spread out more evenly quartertoquarter compared to last year could you give any kind of idea to the outlook we should have for the fourth quarter and then again i’m kind of asking about next year knowing that they haven’t set their budget yet charles m dauber sure yes i think in the last quarter i forgot it was the first quarter earnings or the second quarter earnings what we said is that if we felt like the bomay business was going to be relatively consistent throughout the year right and we said of sort of their historical dynamic where they had a strong first half and then really dropped off in the second half we were expecting more consistent revenue and profitability throughout the year and at least they showed that in q right and so we’ll continue to stand by that view point for the rest of   initial indications that the china market is still going to be down the oil prices are still going to be down we don’t have a view of is bomay going to be flat next year down next year a lot of what the chinese are doing is looking at different projects they’re also doing work internationally right so the chinese are still active just the domestic business that they’re in is actually flat right now so i think that’s about as good a visibility they will have until they get their plans submitted which will be in the q timeframe greg ayers i think you said last quarter that theres been some sort of  bomay has work outside the country charles m dauber yes our  so when you see – so remember this is all stateowned enterprises right and so when you see that let’s say china does a deal to get oil from some country right many times that deal includes china buying oil from somebody but in order to get that oil china says weve got to buy our drilling rigs from chinese drilling rigs and send them to whatever that let’s say country in africa happen to be those drilling rigs are bomco drilling rigs which is our partner and those drilling rigs include power and control systems from bomay this joint venture right so that business is part domestic internal china consumption and part china exports into various markets around the world greg ayers understood understood with the singapore joint venture anything new to really talk about there again it’s just been a project to get that business to really to beginning to grow is there anything new to report charles m dauber yes well i think that two things i would say is the market for them is definitely challenging its oil related so theres a bunch of cost cutting that’s going on right now to make sure that they’ve got the right size for the business levels the other thing that i would say is that the sales manager that we hired i think it was two quarters ago actually started to bring – starting to bring in business that’s not offshore drilling related which is the primary focus that we brought him on for so he is seeing opportunities in the downstream market he is bringing in opportunities for the chemical side markets and the power gen so actually he is starting to take off and were starting to see orders and hoping to start closing those orders to at least augment the existing offshore drilling related business in singapore so that will be the only that would be the only sort of measurable progress i can show internally which is he’s making some progress weve seen a nice pipeline of opportunities now weve got to go help him close them greg ayers good good okay i’ll let someone else go thanks for your answers charles m dauber okay greg thanks operator operator instructions we’ll take our next caller matthew dhane hi this is matt dhane from tieton capital management charles m dauber hi matt so i was curious looking at downstream i know you highlighted that charles as having some nice opportunities is there any way you can help me understand how significant those opportunities could be potentially for utis over the next  months or so is there things that feel like they are getting close and that could be significant meaningful charges for the company here charles m dauber let me try to put some words around this so the trick for the downstream market is one is firstly it got to be a market which we believe that there is this is the downstream company taking advantage of the low oil price which obviously refer to the upstream guy but is a good thing for the downstream guys and this also includes the lng market which is taking the natural gas and liquefying it and building these big lng plants and finally it includes the petrochemical side of the equation which is turning the high availability low cost natural gas into whatever the chemical things but they turn to two tiers or whatever the other thing is alright so we think that the markets there we’ve had to go in the last year really penetrate the epc firms the engineering procurement and construction firms which are the main way that the owners of these projects actually construct the projects and buy and so our penetration of these firms is actually in full swing and i get excited that we have  people from a large engineering firm all come to beaumont with higher bust to bring them out and that’s opening the doors for a number of good projects for us as we head into  so we think at this point we have got good sales coverage we got this new product and these opportunities are there so there was a big the shaneer ph lng project for example and there is some big lng projects where they may have already placed the order for the main parts of the project but we still see opportunities for the smaller parts of that project and those could be  million worth of business for us alright so we see on these projects these are more  million  million  million size opportunities when these customers come to beaumont they can see we are good supplier and we just have to make sure when the approve suppliers left them bidding for them so we actually are relatively positive about that as we head into  based on the work we have been doing thus far in  matthew dhane and the engineering project construction firms how many new firms have you gained relationship and potentially want some potentially smaller pieces of business except for the  that came back over the last  months and present real opportunities going forward charles m dauber there is probably five big sort of the giant epc firms that you could go and come up with a list on and we got orders from one where we have expected orders from another one and we are successfully targeting two more and i think the other the fifth one we are still working on how do we go get into it but id tell you the progress that we have made in this any one of these particular guys has enough projects for us for several quarters of work just for that one engineering firm so the progress we are making is very good i am very pleased with it and we do have to go and execute it right we just got to go execute it matthew dhane and so usually it tests you with a small and minor project sort of – really understand if you are able to execute before they step up to the point and become a more serious customer basically charles m dauber yes and the first project we got from one of these guys was  million so it’s not a super small project that’s a reasonable size project for us but the goal is if you can get the  million then you are in line for the  million matthew dhane okay and so they do really have a very structured process for they work  the chain to bigger projects with time basically they are not going to jump into  million to  million project gates by any means charles m dauber i don’t think that they would that i think they have a more rational approach to new suppliers and when they come to the plant they see all the projects they see the customers we just basically look i am sorry we havent called on you guys either ever or for the last  years but we have been working with these other companies so we can get up that courage to get the first order quickly and so if that’s a  million or  million that’s great we are happy with that and then we want to continue pushing on them for getting those larger projects that the company is now structured to go get matthew dhane great thank you charles charles m dauber okay thanks matt operator operator
