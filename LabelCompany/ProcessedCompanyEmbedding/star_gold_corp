originally organized to explore mineral properties in british columbia canada but the company is currently focusing on gold silver and other base metalbearing properties in nevada the companys main business consists of assembling andor acquiring land packages and mining claims the company believes have potential mining reserves and expending capital to explore these claims by drilling and performing geophysical work or other exploration work deemed necessary  the business is a highrisk business as there is no guarantee that the companys exploration work will ultimately discover or produce any economically viable minerals note   significant accounting policies basis of presentation this summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the financial statements the financial statements and notes are representations of the companys management which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity the accompanying unaudited financial

to form q accordingly the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for complete financial statements in the opinion of our management all adjustments consisting of only normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial statements have been included operating results for the ninemonth period ended january   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending april    all amounts presented are in us dollars  for further information refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto in the companys annual report on form k for the year ended april   going concern as shown in the accompanying financial statements the company has incurred operating losses since inception  as of january   the company has limited financial resources with which to achieve the objectives and obtain profitability and positive cash flows  as shown in the accompanying balance sheets and statements of operations the company has an accumulated deficit of  and at january    the companys working capital was   achievement of the companys objectives will be dependent upon the ability to obtain additional financing to locate profitable mining properties and generate revenue from current and planned business operations and control costs  the company plans to fund its future operations by joint venturing obtaining additional financing from investors andor lenders and attaining commercial production  however there is no assurance that the company will be able to achieve these objectives therefore substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern exists  the financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded assets nor the implications of associated bankruptcy costs should the company be unable to continue as a going concern in the event the company is unable to fulfill the annual exploration expenditures as specified in the property option agreement note  the company will default on the agreements and surrender its right to future claims on the respective property use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to asset page  of  star gold corp notes to financial statements january   impairments and stock option valuation  actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the companys reported financial position and results of operations cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows the company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents   restricted cash restricted cash constitutes cash held as collateral for the faithful performance of bonds securing exploration permits financial instruments   the companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and reclamation bonds  all instruments are accounted for on a historical cost basis which due to the short maturity of these financial instruments approximates fair value at january   fair value measures the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurements asc  requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value  asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value  a financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement  asc  prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value level   level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level   level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quote prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets or modelderived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data level   level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities at january   and april   the company had no assets or liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis mining interests and mineral exploration expenditures exploration costs are expensed in the period in which they occur the company capitalizes costs for acquiring and leasing mining properties and expenses costs to maintain mineral rights as incurred should a property reach the production stage these capitalized costs would be amortized using the unitsofproduction method on the basis of periodic estimates of ore reserves mining interests are periodically assessed for impairment of value and any subsequent losses are charged to operations at the time of impairment if a property is abandoned or sold its capitalized costs are charged to operations page  of  star gold corp notes to financial statements january   equipment equipment is stated at cost depreciation of equipment is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which ranges from three to seven years  maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred significant improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the assets gains or losses on disposition or retirement of property and equipment are recognized in operating expenses reclamation and remediation the companys operations are subject to standards for mine reclamation that have been established by various governmental agencies  in the period in which the company incurs a contractual obligation for the retirement of tangible longlived assets the company will record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability  a corresponding asset will also be recorded and depreciated over the life of the asset  after the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation the liability will be adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation  to date the company has not incurred any contractual obligation requiring recording either a liability or associated asset impaired asset policy the company periodically reviews its longlived assets to determine if any events or changes in circumstances have transpired which indicate that the carrying value of its assets may not be recoverable pursuant to guidance established in asc topic  accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets the company determines impairment by comparing the undiscounted net future cash flows estimated to be generated by its assets to their respective carrying amounts if impairment is deemed to exist the assets will be written down to fair value stockbased compensation the company estimates the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the blackscholes model which requires the input of some subjective assumptions these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected life the estimated volatility of the companys common stock price over the expected term volatility employee forfeiture rate the riskfree interest rate and the dividend yield changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair

the companys financial statements and the integral notes notes thereto included in the companys annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending april    the following statements may be forwardlooking in nature and actual results may differ materially corporate background the company was originally incorporated on december   under the laws of the state of nevada as elan development inc  on april   the name of the company was changed to star gold corp   star gold corp is an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of precious metal deposit properties and advancing them toward production  the company is engaged in the business of exploring evaluating and acquiring mineral prospects with the potential for economic deposits of precious and base metals    star gold corp currently leases with an option to acquire unpatented mining claims located in the state of nevada which in part make up what we refer to as the longstreet property the longstreet property in its entirety comprises  mineral claims  original optioned claims of which  are unpatented staked claims and five claims leased from local ranchers as well as  recently staked claims by star gold covering a total area of approximately  acres  ha the longstreet property is at an intermediate stage of exploration the company has no patents licenses franchises or concessions which are considered by the company to be of importance  the business is not of a seasonal nature  since the potential products are traded in the open market the company has no control over the competitive conditions in the industry   overview of mineral exploration and current operations star gold corp is an exploration stage mineral company with no producing mines  mineral exploration is essentially a research activity that does not produce a product  as such the company acquires properties which it believes have potential to host economic concentrations of minerals particularly gold and silver  these acquisitions have and may take the form of obtaining or leasing unpatented mining claims on federal land or on  private property owned by third parties  an unpatented mining claim is an interest that can be acquired to the mineral rights on open lands of the federal owned public domain  claims are staked in accordance with the mining law of  recorded with the federal government pursuant to laws and regulations established by the bureau of land management   the company intends to remain in the business of exploring for mining properties that have the potential to produce gold silver base metals and other commodities the company will perform basic geological work to identify specific drill targets on the properties and then collect subsurface samples by drilling to confirm the presence of mineralization the presence of economic minerals in a specific area or geological formation  the company may enter into joint venture agreements with other companies to fund further exploration andor development work  it is the companys plan to focus on assembling a high page  of  quality group of midstage mineral primarily gold and silver exploration prospects using the experience and contacts of the management group  by such prospects the company means properties that have been previously identified by third parties including prior owners andor exploration companies as mineral prospects with potential for economic mineralization  often these properties have been sampled mapped and sometimes drilled usually with indefinite results  accordingly such acquired projects will have either prior exploration history or will have strong similarity to a recognized geologic ore deposit model  geographic emphasis will be place on the western united states the geologic potential and ore deposit models have been defined and specific drill targets identified the companys sole remaining property  the companys property evaluation process involves using basic geologic fieldwork to perform an initial evaluation of a property  if the evaluation is positive the company seeks to acquire either by staking unpatented mining claims on open public domain or by leasing the property from the owner of private property or the owner of unpatented claims  once acquired the company then typically makes a more detailed evaluation of the property  this detailed evaluation involves expenditures for exploration work which may include rock and soil sampling geologic mapping geophysics trenching drilling or other means to determine if economic mineralization is present on a property portions of the companys mining properties are owned by third parties and leased to star gold as outlined in the following table   property name third party number of claims

royalty payment of  compliance with government regulations continuing to acquire and explore mineral properties in the state of nevada will be require the company to comply with all regulations rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the state of nevada and the united states federal agencies united states mining in the state of nevada is subject to federal state and local law three types of laws are of particular importance to the companys us mineral properties those affecting land ownership and mining rights those regulating mining operations and those dealing with the environment land ownership and mining rights on federal lands mining rights are governed by the general mining law of  general mining law as amended  usc §§  various sections which allows the location of mining claims on certain federal lands upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and proper compliance with claim location requirements a valid mining claim provides the holder with the right to conduct mining operations for the removal of locatable minerals subject to compliance with the general mining law and nevada state law governing the staking and registration of mining claims as well as compliance with various federal state and local operating and environmental laws regulations and ordinances as the owner or lessee of the unpatented mining claims the company has the right to conduct mining operations on the lands subject to the prior procurement of required operating permits and approvals compliance with the terms and conditions of any applicable mining lease and compliance with applicable federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances page  of  mining operations the exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines is governed by both federal and state laws the state of nevada likewise requires various permits and approvals before mining operations can begin although the state and federal regulatory agencies usually cooperate to minimize duplication of permitting efforts among other things a detailed reclamation plan must be prepared and approved with bonding in the amount of projected reclamation costs the bond is used to ensure that proper reclamation takes place and the bond will not be released until that time the nevada department of environmental protection which is referred to as the ndep is the state agency that administers the reclamation permits mine permits and related closure plans on the nevada property local jurisdictions such as eureka county may also impose permitting requirements such as conditional use permits or zoning approvals environmental law the development operation closure and reclamation of mining projects in the united states requires numerous notifications permits authorizations and public agency decisions compliance with environmental and related laws and regulations requires us to obtain permits issued by regulatory agencies and to file various reports and keep records of the companys operations certain of these permits require periodic renewal or review of their conditions and may be subject to a public review process during which opposition to the companys proposed operations may be encountered the company is currently operating under various permits for activities connected to mineral exploration reclamation and environmental considerations unless and until a mineral resource is proven it is unlikely star gold corp operations will move beyond the exploration stage if in the future the company decides to proceed beyond exploration there will be numerous notifications permit applications and other decisions to be addressed at that time competition star gold corp competes with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties and also for equipment and labor related to exploration and development of mineral properties many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom the company competes have greater financial and technical resources  accordingly competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties in addition they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties this competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development this competition could adversely impact star gold corps ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for the company to develop its mineral properties the company provides no assurance it will be able to compete in any of its business areas effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by the company will not have a material adverse effect on the business financial condition and operating results office and other facilities

requirements commenced in late  and will be ongoing  cultural resource studies began in july  due to the water requirements of the longstreet project additional water rights are required star gold is currently in negotiation for these rights  with the exception of hydrology related drilling the company does not intend to drill further at longstreet deposit until permitting has been completed funds raised pursuant to our most recent private placement see note  are intended to finish all necessary studies and should be sufficient to progress from completing the necessary studies and into

future to complete all necessary steps to apply for final permits required to allow the company to commence any construction of our mining facilities and to begin production of any minerals present in economically viable quantities although the company believes it will be able to source additional financing there are no guarantees any needed financing will be available at the time needed or on acceptable terms if at all  if the company is unable to raise additional financing when necessary it may have to delay exploration efforts or property acquisitions or be forced to cease operations

notice   page  of  disruptions in the credit and financial markets over the past several years have had a material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies  the prices for gold silver and other base metals have also recently been subject to fluctuations which have had a material adverse impact on mining related companies ability to raise capital  these disruptions could among other things make it more difficult for the company to obtain or increase the cost of obtaining capital and financing for operations  access to additional capital may not be available to terms acceptable to the company or at all the companys continuation as a going concern or ultimately to attain profitability is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis to obtain additional financing as may be required and to further develop its properties  potential sources of cash or relief of demand for cash include additional external debt the sale of shares of the companys stock or alternative methods such as joint ventures mergers or sales of the companys assets  no assurances can be given however that the company will be able to obtain any of these potential sources of cash  the company currently requires additional cash funding from outside sources to sustain existing operations and to meet current obligations and ongoing capital requirements   the companys plans for its longterm continuation as a going concern include financing future operations through sales of our common stock andor debt and the eventual profitable exploitation of the companys mining properties  these plans may also at some future point include the formation of mining joint ventures with senior mining company partners on specific mineral properties whereby the joint venture partner would provide the necessary financing in return for an interest in the companys properties andor any minerals it may produce in the future item    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not hold any derivative instruments and does not engage in any hedging activities item    controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  the companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its president and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the companys financial statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management evaluates the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control  integrated framework management under the supervision and with the participation of the companys president and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of january   and concluded that it is ineffective in assuring that the financial reports of the company are free from material errors or misstatements management has identified one material weakness and is taking action to remedy and remove the weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting · inappropriate segregation of duties as the same officer was responsible for initiating and recording transactions thereby creating segregation of duties weakness managements remediation initiatives  because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected  these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake  the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance page  of  that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks the company clearly recognizes and continues to recognize the importance of implementing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and is working to implement an effective system of controls   management is currently evaluating avenues for mitigating the companys internal controls weaknesses but mitigating controls that are practical and cost effective may not be found based on the size structure and future existence of the organization since the company has not generated any significant revenues the company is limited in its options for remediation efforts management within the confines of its budgetary resources will engage its outside accounting firm to assist with an assessment of the companys internal controls over financial reporting as of january   changes in internal controls over financial reporting there have been no material changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended january
