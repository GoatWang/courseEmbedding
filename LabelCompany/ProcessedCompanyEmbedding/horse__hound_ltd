hound began prior to  the only way for area horse owners and riders to purchase the products they needed was through catalogs catalog shopping is always a bit of guesswork  is the product you are choosing the right size strength quality the only way to tell is to wait for the package to arrive and then evaluate the goods keeping what fits and returning what doesnt to try again this time consuming and often frustrating process inspired the inception of horse and hound ltd because each horse and each rider has unique and individual needs hands on purchasing is a much more satisfactory process than the catalog guesswork it made sense to sandra cleary that a retail shop to meet the needs of area horses and riders would be a viable venture that would serve to benefit the area horse community using the knowledge acquired over years of owning riding training and showing horses and working with a network of riders trainers and stable owners sandra cleary developed a cumulative wish list put together by area equestrians and built an inventory to satisfy those wishes hiring sales staff with strong and varied horse experience assured that the horse  hound shopping experience would continue to meet the needs of the areas horses and riders over the past  years the store has grown the inventory has been honed to fit the changing needs of riders and the staff has remained well rounded and experienced  horse and hound has become the horsemans tack shop a faithful clientele has spread the word about the stores sales and service with most advertising accomplished by

measures in farm business biosecurity is the set of management practices designed to prevent the entry and transmission of pathogens that may affect animal farms’ health biosecurity with extranet is a fundamental part of any poultry business as it provides an increase in animal productivity and an increase in economic yields in general terms we must consider the location of the farm construction characteristics of the ship control of foreign animals to the farm cleaning and disinfection of the ship control visits avoid animal stress avoid contamination of feed  control of vaccinations and medications and control of dejections corpses and contumaces the greatest risk that poultry production can have is not to have a biosecurity plan hence biosecurity is a fundamental part of any poultry business to reduce the occurrence of diseases in poultry the concept of biosecurity in a livestock farm refers to the maintenance of the environment free of microorganisms or at least with a minimum load that does not interfere with animal production we can define the concept of biosecurity as the set of management practices that are aimed at reducing the entry and transmission of pathogens and their vectors in animal farms biosecurity measures are designed to prevent and prevent the entry of pathogens that may affect the health welfare and technical performance of poultry biosecurity in our opinion is the cheapest and safest management practice for disease control no disease prevention program can circumvent a biosecurity plan now we understand that the concept of biosecurity is a much broader concept since it also refers to the physical location of the farm physical biosecurity and the design of the farm structural biosecurity every biosecurity plan should be flexible in nature easy and practical to apply and versatile so that it can be adapted to the advances in animal production broadly speaking any biosecurity program must include the following aspects correct location of the farm constructive characteristics of the ship control of animals from the wild wild animals insects rats mice etc cleaning and disinfection of the ship and livestock equipment use of lots of the same age control of visits and personnel outside the farm avoid animal stress avoid contamination of feed control vaccination and medication programs of animals control of dejections corpses and contumaces  location of the farm it is one of the first aspects to consider when setting a biosafety program and perhaps one of the most important factors sometimes the success or failure of the biosafety plan will depend on the location of the farm and its isolation regardless of the correct orientation of the ship according to the altitude and latitude of the area every ship should be kept as far away as possible from other poultry vessels minimum distance  m or of different species minimum distance  km also the farm should be kept away and isolated from any urban center slaughterhouse garbage dump etc in optimal climatic conditions the birds can be infected by microorganisms transported in dust particles by the wind among the pathogens most at risk are mycoplasmas as well as various bacteria and viruses the more isolated the farm is the less likely we are that it can be transited and visited by outside personnel ideally the road or access road to the farm should be used exclusively for the farm personnel in this way we will reduce the traffic of trucks and people outside the minimum possible on the other hand it is recommended that the access roads be asphalted as the dirt roads generate enough dust as trucks pass converting dust particles into vehicles that transmit microorganisms  constructive characteristics of the ship it is essential to have a good insulation of both ceilings and walls not only to favor the maintenance of environmental conditions of optimal temperature and humidity but also to be able to carry out a biosafety plan controlled environment ships will not avoid this risk unless they have filters for bacteria and viruses at the entrance of the air intake the ship must be isolated from the outside as much as possible in such a way as to prevent the access of wild animals insects mice or rats the farm must be fenced at least  m high around its perimeter with only two entrances one for foot staff and one for vehicles both doors being closed all the time keeping about  meters outside the fence free of vegetation  control of strange animals to the ship special care must be taken with insects mainly flies and mosquitoes as they are the main vehicles transmitting diseases that is why we carry out an exhaustive control of them throughout the production cycle as well as the corresponding prevention treatments taking advantage of the days of sanitary vacuum regarding rats and mice we can remember that these can travel up to  km the risk is due to the arrival of rodents from other farms and the diffusion through feed contaminated by feces of rodents on the other hand birds also represent a potential risk as vectors of pathogens mainly salmonella finally we must avoid the presence inside the ship of domestic animals dogs and cats  cleaning and disinfection of the ship and the tooling without a good cleaning and disinfection of the ship we can not pursue the ultimate goal of any biosecurity plan that is maintenance of the ship free of microorganisms apart from the daily cleaning tasks which are based on the livestock species and the operating system used taking advantage of the sanitary voids of the ship between lot and lot of animals all system inside all outside we will carry out a complete cleaning and disinfection of the ship to do this we will dismantle and remove all material and livestock equipment that can be dismantled the ship will be swept washed and thoroughly cleaned avoid exposing new birds including dayold chicks to contact with feces feathers dust and organic waste from the previous batch as some pathogens die quickly others survive for a long time if conditions are  see table   at the time of the reception of a new batch of birds it is advisable to check the heating system ventilation automatic feed distribution drinking troughs etc on the previous day to check that everything works correctly before the arrival of new birds so that you do not forget any aspect of the cleaning it would be advisable that we make a list with the main tasks to develop during the period of sanitary evacuation we must carry out the following tasks dismantle the material and livestock equipment feeders drinking troughs cages fans wheelbarrows etc and remove it to the outside for later washing and disinfecting it outside the ship we have a very effective natural disinfectant such as ultraviolet rays of sunlight which are tremendously potent in the elimination of microorganisms an action that is enhanced by drying outdoors also in this phase the use of the torch can be used for the removal of organic remains as feathers when it exists it will be necessary to remove the old litter and store it in a place as far as possible from the ship until its later destruction or sale as manure thorough sweeping of the exploitation and scraping of the remains of organic matter and droppings that can not be removed by simple sweeping also a dry cleaning of lights ceilings fixed parts of different appliances fans blinds etc will be carried out to avoid the accumulation of dust in these parts remove the cobwebs good cleaning and sweeping are essential as organic matter debris interferes with the action of the disinfectants either because they form a coating barrier or because they react chemically with the disinfectant by neutralizing it later cleaning with water under pressure  atmospheres with this we will make the subsequent application of the disinfectant as effective as possible for cleaning with water we have to follow some basic rules first water is poured second is washed and third is rinsed with the wet cleaning we are going to get reduce the dust particles inside if possible it is recommended to use hot water as it has a greater capacity to carry away the remains of dirt and in addition most disinfectants act better with hot water a highpressure pump for this task would be very useful after washing the ship it is very convenient to remove all traces of detergents since they can neutralize the action of the disinfectants that we use later once the ship is clean and dry we will carry out the disinfection task the application of disinfectants can be sprayed or fumigated most disinfectants act at an ambient temperature of  ° c it is imperative to follow the safety regulations of the disinfectant manufacturer at the time of application in terms of the dose dilutions waiting times protection for the personnel in charge of their application gloves masks boots etc the best disinfectant is formaldehyde generally it is used by fumigation for which all windows and doors must be closed well for the gases to act the method of fumigation is preferred to that of the spray as the gases are able to reach all the corners and grooves of the ship other disinfectants used are phenols phenols are carbon – pitch derivatives they have a characteristic smell and become milky in the water phenols are very effective against bacterial agents and are also effective against fungi and many viruses its most common uses in commercial livestock units include incubation halls sanitation equipment and foot mats quaternary ammonium quaternary ammonium compounds are generally odorless colorless nonirritating and deodorant they also have some detergent action and are good disinfectants however some quaternary ammonium compounds are inactive in the presence of soap or soap residues its antibacterial activity is reduced with the presence of organic material quaternary ammonium compounds are effective against bacteria and somewhat effective against fungi and viruses these compounds are widely used in commercial hatcheries iodophors iodine compounds are a combination of elemental iodine and a substance that makes iodine soluble in water they are good disinfectants but they do not work well in the presence of organic material they are effective against bacteria fungi and many viruses iodine is the least toxic of disinfectants many iodine products can stain clothes and porous surfaces hypochlorites chlorine compounds are good disinfectants on clean surfaces but are rapidly inactivated by dirt chlorine is effective against bacteria and many viruses these compounds are also much more active in hot water than in cold water chlorine solutions can irritate the skin and are corrosive to the metal they are relatively inexpensive peroxides hydrogen peroxide is used in poultry operations they are active against bacteria bacterial spores viruses and fungi at very low concentrations the common hydrogen peroxide can be used by mixing  cc in  liters of drinking water to disinfect the drinking troughs when choosing a disinfectant or another we have to take into account a number of aspects its economic cost its effectiveness it must be effective against an extended range of pathogens viruses bacteria fungi protozoa etc we must take into account the species of livestock in question do not be toxic to animals and safe for operators its residual activity you should not leave residues in the meat its activity with organic matter and soap must be able to penetrate organic matter its effectiveness on fabrics and metals its solubility time of contact all disinfectants require a minimum contact time to show their effectiveness no one acts immediately ambient temperature in which they show more efficiency mode of application of disinfectants use the concentration recommended by the manufacturer and proven effective against pathogens use a suitable volume in such a way that both walls and floors are well impregnated a recommended application volume could be  ml  m  of surface to be treated on porous surfaces the volume can be expanded leave the disinfectant to work during the minimum contact time which is usually at least  minutes when using disinfection equipment that has been previously used in other ships we have to make sure that they are clean as sometimes these equipment can act as transmission vehicles of microorganisms between farm and farm f disinfestation as well as derooting and deratting can be carried out to help control insects mice and rats g taking advantage of the sanitary void can also be carried out a control of water quality through physicalchemical and microbiological analysis we can also carry out chlorination treatments of drinking water at a rate of  ppm for this we use the familiar bleach diluted sodium hypochlorite once the ship is cleaned disinfected and disinfected we will be able to put all the material that we have previously removed and cleaned as well as to replace clean bedding if the livestock species requires it  uniformity of batches use of lots of the same age as this will reduce the contamination of adult animals to the younger if you have to accommodate lots of different ages the ships of the same lot must be separated when a new animal is introduced to the farm it must go through a quarantine period at least  weeks where it will be observed to detect any signs of disease during this period we can use to perform blood tests for the diagnosis of infectious and parasitic diseases  control of visits and farm staff as far as possible we should minimize the visits of foreign personnel to the ship although we are aware that this is very difficult to obtain so it is necessary to have a biosafety program in relation to the visits remember that infectious diseases can spread from one farm to another through the clothing and footwear of visitors or staff moving from ship to ship of different batches of birds prior to the entry of the vehicles they will be washed for which they will have the corresponding washing equipment or a wheel with the relevant disinfectant solution the wheel will need to cover the wheels of the vehicle the most dangerous areas of the trucks are usually the cargo lifts the cabin and the low ones along with the footwear and clothes of the truckers in the same way the entrance of all the personnel to the exploitation will be made previous shower putting a special emphasis in the washing of hair and nails the interior of the ship will be accessed with clothing and footwear for this purpose in the best hygienic conditions possible and that should only be used for that farm in the shower room there should be two areas clean area and dirty area and the movement should be in one direction only it is advisable to have a visitor log book that specifies name of visitor company reason for the visit date and last place where contact with animals took place at the entrance of the ship a pediluvium will be placed for the disinfection of the footwear the pediluvium will be filled with a disinfectant solution that is not affected by the temperature and by the sun’s rays this solution must be renewed at least once a week being very important the cleaning of the boots before submerging them in the pediluvium this is one of the most delicate points and one that should be given more attention since in  of microbial contaminations man acts as a transmitter the transit of the personnel must always be from the youngest to the oldest it is convenient to wash our hands when handling birds of different batches or ages finally we strongly recommend that staff working on the farm do not have birds in their house  avoid stress of animals we must avoid stressful situations throughout the productive cycle since this can deplete the immune system of birds and be an ideal opportunity for certain microorganisms that until that date had been maintained in a latent way in this sense we will monitor the presence of any stressors noise excess light strange odors presence of personnel outside the farm presence of other animals maladaptation to accommodation systems etc a special mention requires acoustic contamination of animals as far as possible the exploitation should be as far away as possible from the main means of communication monitor the maintenance of ventilation equipment and automatic feed distribution so that they do not exceed certain decibels  avoid contamination of feed sometimes it is the own feed the transmitting vehicle of microorganisms especially for certain fungi like aspergillus flavus  we must avoid the humidity in the places of storage of the feed and in the silos since the excess of humidity favors the growth and multiplication of the fungi periodically clean and disinfect food silos always have two silos and disinfect while making alternate use of them to reduce risks it is recommended to use feeds that have undergone heat treatments  control vaccination programs and medication of animals we must strictly follow the schedule of vaccinations established for this purpose by the veterinarian which will include those diseases of compulsory vaccination and optional vaccines depending on the area in question the person in charge of the vaccination must have a perfect knowledge of the vaccine in question dose form of application intervals of revaccination etc always use the previously disinfected material it is advisable to keep a record of the day of vaccination the lot of vaccine used type of vaccine date of expiration etc finally to say that the birds will not be vaccinated in situation of stress since they can have problems when being diminished the immune system  control of dejections corpses and contumaces the farm must have a waste management system that complies with current regulations including the discharge record in wastewater likewise we must have a pit for corpses or an incinerator in the latter case it must be in good condition and comply with all legal requirements all debris such as dead birds broken eggs or other biological remains must be deposited in septic tanks designed for this purpose with hermetic cap conclusions the establishment of a biosecurity program in a poultry farm will provide an increase in animal productivity and an increase in economic returns also the use of certain antimicrobials will be reduced which will reduce antibiotic residues in the eggs and in the channels of the chickens it is necessary to design a biosafety plan that contemplates each one of the points discussed above in a routine way that allows us to control and follow up on a controlled form of all the measures of biosecurity that we have contemplated finally to say that biosafety programs should never be seen as an unnecessary cost imposed by technicians but as an investment with a profitability in the short and medium term why did you choose to give birth at home farm personally this decision seemed to us the most adapted to what we expected from a birth  that is to say and as far as possible concerning my health and that of the baby the arrival of the baby in peace  with as few people as possible in a familiar environment and without being pressed or given me medicine during my pregnancy i also wanted to be followed by the same person  to establish a climate of confidence that she knows us well supports us listens to our doubts if need be i wanted to avoid any stress and make it really simple we were not against medical followup and we did all ultrasounds blood tests monitoring and other preparations at birth like all women who wait for a child the only difference is that i stayed with my midwife for me all alone on the day of childbirth my daughter was born on my bed from her dad’s hands and four hours after birth we were all  in our house serenely generally women who opt for childbirth at home do so because they do not want to go to the hospital and prefer to opt for the comfort of a habitat they like how many home births take place each year in france and abroad  there are quite few of them and the real numbers are even lower than the reality  since the statistics also count the mothers who give birth unexpectedly at home in their car at work and so on in the  netherlands  the system is very advanced with a rate of  of births at home the public finances understood that it was cheaper for them and antennas are established all over the country in the united kingdom about  of births occur in parents’ homes in france in  there were approximately  selected home births followed by a liberal midwife and properly prepared according to the  national council of the midwifery  there would be fewer  each year out of a total of   births ndrl there are more and more couples interested in this option but few of them have the opportunity because there are only about sixty liberal midwives who deliver home deliveries in france  midwives in  ndrl they are poorly distributed geographically some highly motivated couples still travel hundreds of kilometers to find their midwife how well prepare who to trust photo raphael goetter on flickr to prepare well it is enough to follow with assiduity the appointments with his midwife you have to trust yourself the dad the midwife and especially the baby it has been tens of thousands of years since the human species and all mammals reproduce in this way let us trust our bodies medicine is formidable in case of danger and to facilitate the life of patients who suffer from diseases being pregnant and giving birth is not being sick and after childbirth the midwife leaves after the first observation tests with the baby and after making sure that the mother is well she gives advice for feeding on the first day she returns the following days a few hours depending on her availability and the needs of the parents she can be contacted by phone if necessaryyou may visit our website here healthy skin – of interest – skin care after summer for farmers and outdoor workers the recovery of the skin after the summer is based on a good exfoliation and the subsequent rehydration the sun and the outdoors are aggressive agents for the skin and this needs immediate repair after the summer the main damage to the skin during the summer is dehydration  thus when the humidity goes from  to  the skin undergoes a dehydration of  this loss of water causes a less lustrous dry and rough skin air conditioning is also a factor to take into account since the sudden thermal change and the dryness of these cooling systems encourage further dehydration if at all in addition to dehydration the skin suffers from the appearance of photoaging or aginginduced lesions caused by solar action resulting in a greater degree of deterioration and the appearance of enlarged spots and capillaries exposure to the sun’s rays even with cloudy skies should involve in all cases constantly and more in children the continued use of sunscreens suited to the activity latitude subject’s age and color of the skin solar irradiation on the skin is related to skin cancer and malignant melanoma  in addition the skin “remembers” the small injuries received in childhood after their repeated encounters with the sun which must not be forgotten that it is one of the most

behaves differently than it does in other alternative methods be it wax razor razor or electric hair removal it causes surprise in the user to discover that a few days after the laser session part of the hair can leave again some come to think that the session has had no effect which has been poorly done so that hair continues to grow normally these ideas can be reinforced when an indeterminate percentage of them do not fall definitively until fifteen or twenty days later it is not really the consequence of a bad application but it is a perfectly natural effect in this procedure of hair removal warned or not by the user this behavior is because the root is the part of the hair that absorbs most of the energy transmitted in each shotconsequently it is the zone that reaches the highest temperature during the treatment in this way the root is weakened damaged so the stem will be released days later leaving in the skin a small stretch that the body will expel as it would any other foreign element throughout this process which can last for a couple of weeks the stem begins to stick out of the epidermis if at that moment we would pull it out with a pair of tweezers even with our fingers we would extract it completely without the least resistance and in fact the root of that hair no longer has any link with the hair follicle that generated it consequently when the stem has emerged and the hairs are in this state they will be detached in the shower by the rubbing of the clothes by the movements that we do in sleep and of course if we use exfoliating soaps and sponges for the release the skin from dead cells this circumstance absolutely logical in laser hair removal does not happen in all sessions nor in  of hair treated you want to know more this spontaneous drop of hairs treated in the session occurs only in an undetermined percentage of them not at all the cause is the cyclic growth of hair in the next session the effect will occur in another indeterminate percentage reason why it is necessary to realize successive sessions here are some additional information to complete your knowledge on the subject the anagen phase of the hair is ideal to receive a session of laser hair removal scottsdale the percentage of the same in this phase varies from some zones and circumstances to others thus in the armpits may not exceed  most hairs – the remaining  – are in the catagen or telogen phase so they do not meet the appropriate conditions for treatment  it is the  of hairs in the anagen phase that can fall spontaneously in those two or three weeks from the application of the treatment in the next session the process will be repeated this time with another  different approximately hairs in the facial area of the upper lip there are higher percentages of hair in the anagen phase as a colophon it should be remembered that the ability to warm properly is low when the hair is in the catagen or telogen phase so the effectiveness of the session

power and form their own government which will evolve into a brutal tyranny it is considered a veiled criticism of the russian revolution and the corruption of soviet socialism in the times of stalin  the main theme of the play is the abuse of power and how it corrupts those who possess it leading to greed discrimination and betrayal thus rebelion pigs on the farm use their power to manipulate and deceive other animals and secure their hold on them animal farm also is a strong criticism of the government of the ussr and is generally considered a fable describing the failures of communism  after the second world war  respect for russian communism as a form of government had grown considerably and george orwell tried to show through his book that russia was not a real socialist society but a ruthless tyranny despite this given the open and universal character of his message the fable transcends that framework and is an effective critique of corruption that involves the abuse of power in any society also addresses the criticism against the totalitarianism of any kind frequent theme in the works of george orwell and examines the movement and manipulation of historical truth suffers in times of political transformation another frequent theme in the work of george orwell and will be present in animal farm is the use of force and violence as a means of social control as seen in chapter vii of the book which describes the persecution and the extermination of internal opposition within the farm it is important to know the historical events surrounding the establishment of the ussr to appreciate the satire that makes george orwell on the degeneration of the russian revolution in tyranny and its protagonists in  the call is initiated russian revolution that led to the fall of the government of czar nicholas ii  and the establishment of communism in russia which was renamed the union of soviet socialist republics  or ussr from  this regime lasted until  leaders of the revolution were ulyanov vladimir ilyich better known as lenin  and leon trotsky  who took power by force of arms and established a workers ‘ state under the dictatorship of the proletariat  based on the ideals of marxism and the elimination of private property however after the death of lenin joseph stalin took control of the ussr and the communist party of the soviet union by establishing a model of reform from above and “socialism in one country” to the detriment of the theory of permanent revolution of trotsky this meant a system of political purges and leon trotsky  his supporters and other democratic communists and anarchists were persecuted imprisoned and killed george orwell knew about the communist party and its doctrines and knew what was going on in russia however at that time the criticisms of soviet communism were not popular because the ussr was considered a bulwark against nazism  and maintained good relations with the british government animal farm was written during world war ii  was published in  but became known by the public until the end of the  ‘s had in his time many problems of criticism and censure since by that time england was an ally of the soviet union and the ruthless criticism of stalin’s government of the book did not please the english government that it did not want tensions with russia animal farm is considered one of the most important novels of the twentieth century it has been translated into fifteen languages and was chosen among the top  english – language novels by time magazine besides winning the hugo retrospectively fantasy literature prize in  the play has been adapted twice in  a british animated version directed by halas and batchelor was realized and in  a film for television with real image directed by joseph stephenson was realized summary of the farm rebellion plot the book tells the story of the manor farm whose owner mr jones  is fond of drink and neglected animals they gather to hear the speech that considered the wisest animal farm the pig old major  mayor tells them of his dream of freedom where all animals are equal and have the same rights and tells them to get that dream must get rid of the oppressive yoke of humans in his speech mayor teaches an old song from his childhood “beasts of england” which speaks of a world in which animals are free and not have to work for humans in that world animals enjoy the fruit of their labor and if there is abundance it is for all and they would no longer suffer hunger or cold after the speech the pigs make a vote where they decide that all animals are friends and man enemy one day after mr jones stop feeding the animals rebel and there ‘s a fight on the farm led by two young pigs  snowball and napoleon  the animals win and expel the farmer jones and its employees from the farm however the old major dies before seeing the triumph after the victory the animals are organized under old major’s ideas which they call “animalism” and pigs are established as leaders they learn to read and write and change the sign of the farm by farm animals  they write on the wall the seven rules that established the old major before his death and they consider the seven commandments of the farm whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy everything that walks on four legs or has wings is a friend no animal will wear clothing no animal will sleep in a bed no animal will drink alcohol no animal will kill another animal all animals are the same in the beginning everything works better than before the animals work longer because they are not slaves they know they will enjoy the fruits of their work and have a good harvest  however soon the problems begin with the pigs who have selfdirected the leaders and begin to abuse their power they keep the best of the crop and eat all the apples and milk saying that they need them to think an attack then occurs to the farm by the mr jones  he wants it back the animals defend themselves and stop the attack boxer  strong workhorse and snowball receive medals for bravery in battle however they soon begin fighting for power between napoleon and snowball  on the one hand snowball wants to build a windmill for electricity there on the farm napoleon opposes and during the meeting organized by snowball to explain his plan to the other animals napoleon  who raised the farm dogs to obey the spear on him with intent to kill but snowball escapes and flees the farm in the following year napoleon becomes a real dictator using dogs as their personal police against anyone who opposes him and increasingly breaking the commandments that started the revolution he orders to build the windmill that snowball invented and when a storm destroys it he makes snowball responsible and blames him for what happened in front of all the animals accusing him of being a traitor napoleon ordered again rebuild the mill a task in which the horse is essential boxer and strength the tyranny of napoleon increases to the point of forcing innocent people to “confess” false treason and do kill their dogs before all the farm animals then he and the other pigs start sleeping in beds and drinking alcohol the commandments begin to be modified to justify the behavior of the pigs “no animal shall drink alcohol” it becomes “no animal shall drink alcoho excess”  after the mill is completed the farm is under attack by the neighboring farmer frederick  with whom napoleon had been trading the animals win the battle but the mill is again destroyed boxer offers new strength to build again the mill but the exhausting work that provokes undergoes a collapse and eventually excessive effort made her kills napoleon then decided to sell it to a factory where they manufactured glue with his cadaver faced with indignant protests from other animals the pig squealer  spokesman napoleon tells them that boxer was taken to a veterinary clinic where he died peacefully and all decide to believe him the years pass and animal farm expands with purchase of napoleon two fields to a neighboring farmer pilkington however life for nonpig animals is getting tougher as these will carry the best food and all the amenities the pigs soon begin to walk on two legs imitating humans and wear human clothing the ancient commandments have disappeared and been reduced to a single law “all animals are equal but some are more equal than others” the novel ends with pilkington and pigs drinking in the house jones napoleon has changed the name of the farm manor farm and plays cards with pilkington  both trying to make traps each other the rest of the animals look out the window and are unable to distinguish pigs from humans rebellion characters on the farm the main characters of this novel are the following old man he is a wise pig who wanted a world where animals lived with dignity the rebellion of the animals is based on his ideas but he dies before seeing his triumph the figure of mayor the leader respected by all has often been associated with lenin  with clear references in the novel as the story of the unearthing of skull mayor for public exposure in clear reference to mummification and exhibition of lenin  his affable and looking for a more just world character has also to be related to karl marx  the ideologist of communism whose ideas of equality and defense of the proletariat were gradually degenerating under the rule of stalin snowball it is the other aspiring leader of the farm bright brave and full of projects is often compared him with leon trotsky  who led the red army in the ussr like snowball leads the animals against farmer jones  similarly to the flight of snowball dogs that napoleon sent after him trotsky suffered persecution by the police of stalin  accused of treason finally being murdered in exile napoleon he is one of the pigs of strong personality and that tends to get his way along with snowball leads the rebellion against jones  after the triumph of the revolution he begins to control all aspects of the farm until he becomes a ruthless tyrant george orwell gives including the name all the characteristics of totalitarian dictators although its resemblance to the russian dictator stalin is the clearest like him the lack of brilliance of napoleon not prevent him from being a great conspirator and have a strong and cruel character which eventually lead him to power from there as you would stalin  undertakes a series of planning measures like the five – year plans in russia of the farm economy personified especially in the construction of a mill idea of snowball that napoleon first rejected and then it appropriates and persecutes and kills it considers a danger to his government as in the notorious purges during the rule of stalin  squealer one of the pigs that becomes the lieutenant and spokesman of napoleon through the book shows his ability to manipulate other animals with his convincing rhetoric it represents the propaganda mechanisms used by the government of stalin who like napoleon presented himself as an idealist always seeking the good of the people boxer a working horse strong and dedicated he serves with all his being to the revolution of animals only to be sold by napoleon to a factory of glue after dying of pure exhaustion working to rebuild the mill boxer would represent the proletariat of russia the workers who were supposed to be the soul of the revolution and who for george orwell would have been deceived and betrayed by the leaders of the communist party mollie it is the mare that was responsible for pulling mr jones’s car pretentious and superficial prefers ties and sugar before revolutionary ideas and finally leaves the farm with the promise of a more pleasant life it represents the middle class of russia who accepted the excesses of the government in order to maintain a privileged position clover she is a shooting mare friend of boxer and that tries to help to him when it falls surrendered of exhaustion benjamin he’s an ass friend of boxer cynical and pessimistic he does not believe in the revolution it represents the intellectuals it is always caustic and very negative regarding the intentions of the pigs but in the end it does not oppose them and consents to their excesses paula hawkins’ novel  dogs at first there are three dogs on the farm bluebell jessie and pincher napoleon stays with his puppies and breeds them and trains them to be their guard dogs napoleon dogs represent the kgb  the secret police of stalin  who used to hunt down and kill the opposition moses the raven it was mr jones’s pet and tells stories to the animals about a paradisiacal land called “monte azucar” to which animals go when they die and where there is no suffering it represents religion and its promises of a better world in the afterlife sheep and chickens they are the majority of the farm and represent the russian peasantry  of the population they are characterized by being stupid and totally uncritical about the measurements of pigs although the russian peasantry can not be regarded as stupid it is true that most of them were an illiterate and deideologized population mr jones the owner of the farm manor drinker and neglected with the farm is expelled of the same by his own animals represent the czar nicholas ii of russia  which just as the farmer jones had complete mastery over the farm was considered the only leader of russia in the revolution of  the people revolted against him blaming him for the hunger and misery they suffered and for the destruction caused by world war i frederick and pilkington they are the other farmers and represent adolf hitler and winston churchill  respectively as farmers respect to farm animals for their prosperity and strength but deep down they hate the world around the ussr admired its economic progress and feared military power although most of europe and usa were opposed to communism commentary on rebellion on the farm animal farm belongs to the literary genre of the narrative  and is usually included in the subgenus of fable or allegory but is also considered a political satire  a fable level of the work has a strong educational character  and warning about the dangers of abuse of power at the level of satire it is an obvious criticism of the russian revolution and its protagonists it consists of  chapters and can be divided into two parts the first bases of the revolution of the animals are narrated since the introduction of the libertarian ideology by mayor until the conquest of the farm in the second part the deterioration of the egalitarian ideas of the beginning is shown and how farm animals slowly returns to its initial state of tyranny under the yoke of the pigs and the complete betrayal of the revolution these george orwell uses the resource to use animals as protagonists of history traditional mechanism of fables to put distance between actual events and satirized and so make the most of the possibilities humorous characters tyrants are pigs ignorant workers are represented with a donkey etc a constant throughout the work is the use of satirical humor  being cruel and ruthless in most of the characterizations and most of the characters are ridiculous stupid and  or evil a frequent feature of the satire characters in addition the work is a clear analysis of the corruption that breeds power expressed in a simple and direct language getting the message transcends the particular case of the soviet regime and be

effective cleaning in pig farms cleaning and disinfection are part of biosecurity programs implemented in swine facilities in order to prevent the entry reverse the spread and minimize the risk that may pose a pathogen both for animals and for farm staff pig farms are permanently under the threat of entry and spread of pathogens the explosion of an outbreak of an infectious disease especially if it is a notifiable disease official statement in addition to the commitment to its viability is a source of risk for other animal species and even humans if the responsible agent is zoonotic bacteria and fungi can survive and some multiply on wet surfaces especially if there is organic matterwhile most bacteria are labile and fragile exceptions such as mycobacteria and sporulated bacilli resisting hostile conditions similarly the behavior of pathogenic microorganisms against chemical compounds is variable depending on the type of differences cell wall and spore forming ability in any case as with antibiotics they have also been described resistances viruses which are unique in their dependence on living cells some are resistant to the environment and can survive long periods as with parvovirus until a few years ago the practices we know today under the name comprehensive biosafety were not sufficiently valued the professionalization of the production sectors and scientific studies demonstrating its utility sectors have made themselves and administrations include national programs often mandatory for the control and eradication of many infectious diseases biosecurity includes a set of measures that are intended to prevent the entry of pathogens on a farm and as the case may slow or prevent its spread in her and other neighbors as well as minimize the risk if any for employees the cleaning and disinfection practices are main part of the programs and every day more important cleaning as a preliminary step cleaning and disinfection are inseparable phases of hygiene in pig farms on farms are unusual circumstances walls floors and ceilings rough surface abundance of organic matter low temperatures etc which represent limiting factors for the action of disinfectants requiring minimize its negative effect to achieve favorable results for this reason precleaning disinfection is critical in it as who  noted they can be considered two general systems for cleaning dry and wet in any case the process begins by cleaning the fans where they exist and air intakes after bedding and manure floor or cages are removed without neglecting the corners ribbons manure collection and final wellsequipment cages feeding watering etc collects the accumulated matter and all material outside the barn is transported dismantled on the outside over an area of concrete proceeds to washing with high pressure washing vancouver wa water followed by drying and disinfection inside brush sweeps and vacuums to remove dust and dirt from ceilings electrical installation beams cornices walls cages parts of fans air intakes and corridors all in updown and back ahead fouling scratch by hand with a wire brush in order to save costs labor and time on farms cleaning with high pressure water cleaning in two phases often used and soaked soaking is wetted with water l  m  h sometimes liquid detergents are added in cleaning itself cleaners are used at pressures of  bar at a distance not less than  cm from the surface it is more effective than cold hot water on wood or concrete surfaces poor conductors the optimum temperature is  ° c while higher temperatures metal surfaces can be used with best results if the application time on the surface is sufficiently long the recommended flow is  l  h if cold water can reach  the use of pressurized water can generate secondary aerosols that cause hazardous situations if there has been an outbreak particularly if zoonotic agents are involved so precautions should be taken after cleaning leave the plants dry if devices are provided for this heating and ventilation to facilitate water evaporation alternate drying reduces pollution at least one log cycle especially gramnegative microorganisms depending on the type of material cleaning can reduce  log or more of the total bacteria count as they reduce the effective disinfectant which means that under normal conditions per cm of farms can

increase indirectly production and improve production and quality of products of animal origin the choice of disinfectant is important in general in the case of outbreaks of notifiable diseases often pure substances of activity tested against the causative pathogen used while nonspecific preventive disinfection using commercial formulations of broad spectrum include various compounds or combinations and their effectiveness depends on the concentration of use all recommendations should be based on laboratory data disinfectants used in animal farms can be grouped into quaternary ammonium derivatives phenols halogenreleasing compounds halogenated phenols aldehydes biguanides and polymeric biguanides acids and alkalis oxidizing agents   an ideal disinfectant should be soluble in water broad spectrum active in the presence of organic stable material nontoxic fast acting with residual penetrating compatible with all materials action which does not affect the environment available and good value for costriskbenefit in general for disinfecting a surface in a warehouse it takes at least  l  m and equipment is recommended to add  more the effectiveness of disinfection depends on the disinfectant and microorganism to which the practice is addressed as well as other characteristics that influence both as resistance and survival of the agent the ability to multiply the concentration of disinfectant contact duration ambient temperature etc the optimum temperature for liquids used in the cleaning and disinfecting farms is  ° c and for the surfaces of  ° c colder requires higher concentrations below  ° c the disinfection effect is incomplete humidity and air velocity negatively affect most surface disinfectants disinfection should be performed in the same order as wet cleaning that is from top to bottom and back to front of the building it is advisable to know the nature of the surface of the floor ceiling and walls to correctly apply disinfectants the contact time with the surface can vary depending on the type of disinfectant used should follow the manufacturer’s recommendations contained in the label for application various methods can be used
