according to government statistics the most recent recession spanned the first three quarters of  by the fourth quarter of that year growth took hold and the question on investors minds turned to the pace of the recovery over the last  months the commerce department reported uninterrupted expansion of the economy yet that revival as measured by gross domestic product gdp has been erratic in the first quarter of  gdp growth was a robust inflationadjusted  by the final quarter of  gdp grew a meager  while the economic recovery moved forward with an uneven pace throughout the month period ended december   bond investors enjoyed a rather robust period in the fixedincome market the driving force of the fixedincome market was the steady decline in interest rates prompted by a low inflation outlook rates also moved lower due to the actions of the federal reserve and its monetary strategy of adding liquidity to maintain economic growth in early november the fed lowered rates one half percent just in time to give the economy an added measure of stimuli going into the holiday shopping season yet another positive for the bond market came with investors seeking bonds with the lowest levels of credit risk hence the interest in securities issued by the us government and its affiliated agencies this flight to quality was largely based on geopolitical concerns reaction to acts of corporate malfeasance and a weak stock market in fact stocks underperformed bonds for a third straight year the first time that event has occurred in over twenty years few areas of the stock market could avoid the selling pressures for the period of this report the standard  poors  stock index fell roughly  and the techladen nasdaq composite index declined approximately  despite a brief rally in late july and another upsurge to span october and november the selling pressure in stocks had the greatest impact on performance and was caused largely by investor uncertainty regarding the pace of the recovery investors have vacillated in their opinion about the course of the economy ongoing concern has been focused on the lack of business spending throughout the economic recovery also known as capital expenditure corporations spent at an historically high level in the s leading to excess capacity with the ensuing mismatch between production and demand businesses substantially scaled back on their spending with the new decade we believe this retrenchment helped spark the recession of  as well as inhibited the economic ability to bounce back as with many prior postrecessionary environments

federal reserve as with their  interest rate cuts of  were appearing to take hold lower rates for instance prompted a wave of mortgage refinancing that totaled  billion in  and  freeing up added cash for families across the nation source the wall street journal lastly investors monitored news reports in early january of the bush administrations proposed massive spending and taxcut package designed to pump some  billion into the economy over the next decade though this measure must go before congress it nonetheless supports the supposition that growth is not only in place but has the backing of very significant macroeconomic forces market outlook we are guardedly optimistic about the status of the economic environment and financial markets as the new year moves along we believe that inflation will remain largely in check and that the economy will continue to expand in  ongoing growth should likely bring with it higher interest rates likewise washingtons stimulus policy could increase the supply of treasuries adding further pressure on rates we remind investors that rising rates contribute to the declining market prices of fixedincome securities with shorterterm bonds offering the least decrease in value for investors with a longerterm perspective the benefit of such an environment is that the income stream from their bond funds may likely experience a modest increase we also point out that bonds have consistently served to dampen volatility within diversified investor portfolios of course diplomatic affairs between the us and iraq have taken center stage over the past several weeks as no one knows precisely how this delicate matter will be played out in the coming weeks or months we feel it may be best to take advantage of the waitandsee environment that has evolved of late for investors to meet with their financial professionals in doing so longerterm investment goals can be updated and the type and composition of funds to achieve those objectives may be properly evaluated thank you for your continued confidence in and commitment to delaware investments sincerely s jude t driscoll  jude t driscoll president and chief executive

portfolio delaware limitedterm government fund management review january   fund managers paul grillo jr senior portfolio manager stephen r cianci senior portfolio manager the funds results your fund is managed with the attempt to generate a high level of income while reducing the effects of interestrate changes we do this by limiting duration strategy and keeping the average bond maturity below five years as part of our program of risk controls we closely monitor and strictly control risk factors attributed to prepayment and credit concerns we also employ proprietary models to track relative performance versus our peer group in selecting securities for your fund we analyze macroeconomic factors to discover inefficiencies in the fixedincome market and identify the securities that we believe offer the best reward opportunities for the fund we believe our combination of a quantitative screening process and stringent qualitative analysis provides us a robust management style with which to address the everchanging environment of fixedincome investing for the month period covered in this report your fund gained  class a shares at net asset value with distributions reinvested the merrill lynch  year treasury index which serves as the funds benchmark rose  the lipper shortintermediate government funds average which serves as the funds peer group returned  for the period portfolio highlights our general management style for your fund has been to maintain a high premium on safety the month period just ended will long be remembered for four primary themes declining interest rates a low inflationary environment acts of corporate irresponsibility and geopolitical risks the first two favored bond funds in general and your fund in particular as we were able to function in the very attractive shorttointermediate sector of the government bond market while the latter two themes added to investor concerns for the financial markets the demand for highlyrated government securities allowed us to be somewhat defensive in managing the fund accordingly we began the fiscal year with just such a conservative posture keeping down the maturity and duration a measure of bond price sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the bonds within the portfolio the move proved advantageous as rates moved slightly upwards from february to march once the downward trend in interest rates reestablished itself we chose to neutralize the funds duration relative to our benchmark index and peer funds the decision to neutralize was a prudent one interest rates in this environment dropped significantly as with the year treasury bond yield which declined approximately one half percentage point from our action we were able to produce returns competitive with our benchmark as the funds fiscal year moved into its final quarter we elected to return to a somewhat shorter maturity versus our peers we believed prolonged expansion of the economy could likely bring with it a generally upward bias in interest rates rates in fact did move slightly upwards from september until november such an upmove in rates can cause modest declines in bond values and our decision to rein in portfolio maturity and duration was intended to help mitigate any price movements while ensuring a competitive flow of current income for the fiscal year we did not alter the aggregate credit quality of the portfolio we did increase the funds exposure to treasury securities given their attractive riskreturn profiles we increased our weighting in high quality governmentoriented agency bonds where we reduced bond exposure was in premium mortgagebacked securities  pndth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th outlook with a new year ahead of us we believe that the expansionoriented monetary and fiscal stimulus programs that date to  are beginning to be felt within the economy such powerful catalysts for growth should enable the economic expansion to continue into  the offset to the federal reserves policies is that interest rates may eventually need to be moved higher perhaps by one half percent a move of this nature would not only redirect the feds policy on interest rates since the recent recession but would impact bonds by moving prices slightly lower this process would tend to be felt most in longerterm bonds since their income payments move further out into the future and thus are more susceptible to an erosion in purchasing power caused by rising inflation conversely shorterterm bonds such as those found within your portfolio would tend to be less impacted by rising rates as no investor possesses a crystal ball as to the detailed future actions of interest rates or the financial markets we believe it may be best for investors to seek a broadly diversified portfolio we also believe the delaware limitedterm government fund can have a meaningful place in such a portfolio given its ability to generate a steady stream of income
