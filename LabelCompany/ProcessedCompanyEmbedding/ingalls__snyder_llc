clientsmanaged funds how we are differentpeopleaccess to your accountcontact us how we are different our investment advisors are skilled portfolio managersunlike the typical retail brokerage our professionals are not “asset gatherers” who generally pass clients’ money along to third party institutions or mutual funds our professionals are skilled and experienced portfolio managers who handle research security selection and portfolio construction we create and manage investment portfolios directly for our clients and our clients generally appreciate knowing what they own and why they own iteach client’s portfolio is customizedto us each client is unique in his or her financial situation and investment needs while the financial markets are diverse and constantly changing we believe good portfolio management involves continuously considering the many investment opportunities globally available and aligning each client’s assets with a set of securities appropriate to them our investment advisors are not working off of an “approved” or “buy” list of securitiesour interests are aligned with those of our clientsall too often we see firms offering creative new “investment products” with high fees andor sales charges  we do not know if these offerings maximize the earnings of investors but they certainly appear to maximize the earnings of their sponsors  our firm by contrast does not sell third party investment products on commission most of our discretionary client accounts are managed for a competitive assetbased fee so our income primarily grows based on the growth in our clients’ assets most directly should those assets appreciate under our direction a limited part of our business involves managing hedge funds where our incentives are also aligned  we earn our income primarily from the asset value and investment performance of the funds not from sales chargeswe custody our clients’ assets and clear our own tradesfor a firm our size ingalls  snyder is relatively unique in the scope of its infrastructure we are a registered brokerdealer a member of the new york stock exchange and a clearing member of depository trust company and options clearing corporation in practice this means that when you have an important request  such as wiring funds moving securities or getting special handling of a transaction  you receive a level of service that is rarely seen by individual clients of investment advisory firms  as an investment advisory client you do not have to deal with an unfamiliar custodian and do not have to pay separate custody fees furthermore while your assets are in our custody they are carefully segregated from assets of our firm with the custody controls regularly audited by a reputable outside audit firm we are small enough to be personal yet big enough to be efficient and stableingalls  snyder has many of the attributes of a small firm  direct personal relationships with our clients and a high level of personal service at the same time we have the infrastructure to operate at an efficient scale and with market presence we believe in being well capitalized for our size and conservatively managed which permits us to weather the frequent cycles in our businesswe are owned by our principalswe have seen the unfortunate consequences from time to time of some wall street firms engaging in risky and poorly understood activities at ingalls  snyder our own money is at work and at risk in our business every day we have no outside shareholders this makes us very conscious of the risks we take taking outsized risks in our business whatever the potential returns is simply not an option at our firm member      nyse   finra   sipc  copyright  ingalls  snyder llc  all rights reserved ingalls  snyder secure client login
