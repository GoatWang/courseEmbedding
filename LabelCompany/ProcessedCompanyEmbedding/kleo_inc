funding the series a round is being led by biohaven pharmaceutical holding company ltd biohaven and will support the company’s development platform of antibody recruiting molecules arms and synthetic antibody mimics syamsarms are bifunctional or ‘twoheaded’ chemical structures designed such that one head interacts with diseaserelevant molecular targets such as cancers while the other head interacts directly with antibodies already present in a person’s bloodstream syams are novel synthetic molecules that possess both the targeting and effector cell activating functions of antibodies the new drugs being developed by kleo recruit the immune system to target and kill disease specific cellskleo pharmaceuticals was founded on the research of david a spiegel md phd a professor of chemistry and pharmacology at yale university “biologics have been the gold standard for immunotherapies with arms and syams we have the opportunity to raise that bar” said dr spiegel ”our ability to rationally design and synthesize small molecules that emulate the functionality of biologics represents a great advancement in the field our molecules are hundreds of times lighter than their biological counterparts and thus may infiltrate tissue more efficiently than large proteins these small molecules are easier to produce more tractable to engineer and nonimmunogenic  it’s a tremendously exciting time”“kleo’s groundbreaking technology opens up exciting new paths in the development of innovative immunotherapies” said declan doogan md chairman of biohaven pharmaceuticals “we were drawn to this opportunity by both the strength of the technology and the ambitious vision dr spiegel has for applying it to advance treatment options for patients across a wide range of

related to antibody recruiting molecules arms and synthetic antibody molecules syams originally developed in the laboratory of david a spiegel md phdthis new class of drugs discovered by dr spiegel are bifunctional small molecules that can recruit the immune system to target and kill specific disease cells these molecules combine the advantages of biologics with those of traditional small molecules the technology promises to further expand the already large growing market for immunotherapies by improving overall treatment efficacy safety and accessibilitydr spiegel commented  ”this technology emerged from years of research that began as an exploration of using small molecules to manipulate the body’s natural capabilities in fighting disease initial proof of concept experiments in animals successfully demonstrate the safety and efficacy of arms and syams as immunomodulatory drugs i’m very excited to see how they will perform in clinical development“kleo received support to launch the platform from the office of cooperative research ocr which guides the commercialization process for yale faculty and researchers the intellectual property technology and lead molecules licensed from yale includes all  aspects of the arm and syam platform with the exception of a single target psma that was previously licensed from yale university to alliedbristol life sciences abls last year“we see tremendous opportunities to leverage dr spiegel’s research in the development of novel treatments for a wide range of diseases” said roy prieb cofounder at kleo pharmaceuticals “we
