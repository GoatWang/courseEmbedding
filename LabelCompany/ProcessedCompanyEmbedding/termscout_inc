sourcetermscout  reviewupdated on july  validated reviewverified current userwhat do you like bestwhat i like about termscout is that it keeps me away from spending time online searching for companies that are growing or reading through articles to search for companies that are going through rounds of funding the alerts id say are the most helpful to me now its even easier when you link it to your linkedin because you can automatically see how youre connected to your target what do you dislikewhat i dont like is that i receive all of the notifications alerts all at once at am everyday it would be nice to receive them throughout the day or as they happenwhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedbusiness problems it makes it easy to connect the dots with companies you are aware of but dont know the entire situation behind them it makes it an easier and warmer conversation when you catch a ceo on the phone and you know exactly the amount of money they just raised or its also fun bring one of the first people to call them and congratulate them for their new role in the companythey always like that one read moreshare on of  found this

validated reviewverified current userwhat do you like bestthe specific information primarily the decision makers and the content is more accurate that other property management tools in regards to the businesses i also like the funding and other various events that trigger noticeswhat do you dislikeonly because of the way it is distributed amongst our peers there is not enough leads as a sales rep we need an additional drop down field such as working or temporary status instead of lead created or closed recommendations to others considering the productif the content is limited try not to spread the information to thin this is a great resource for small work forces or even an individual but when spread across a large enterprise it limites the value on an individual basis perhaps is beneficial for the company but from an individual user perspective it doest appear to be of great value what business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedanytime we have

updates and potential lead gen opportunities were simple to understand and emailed to me daily the set up was also just as easy  the termscout representative we were working with took care of all the hard stuff we just had to check the potential leads and reach out what do you dislikeunfortunately the type of insights didnt fit our very niche industry electronics recycling but can see it working with most others the different type of events were interesting but many were irrelevant to our industry additionally the trial was limited to specific geoareas which limited our ability to judge the product pricing also seemed a bit complicated but was not unreasonable recommendations to others considering the productgreat insights on events that could lead to a sale highly recommend for sales companies whos products tend to get purchased when a company undergoes some sort of change growth movement funding etc when setting up the trial try to be as specific as possible about what geo location and event type will be the most valuable to you  this will allow your rep to guarantee the most value during your trial run i think we made the error of not optimizing our locations what business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedwe help companies recycle resell and dispose of electronic equipment termscout showed us a few lead gen opportunities
