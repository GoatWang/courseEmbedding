seeker  techrepublic search go cxo chase adam startup founder ceo ngo innovator global seeker watsi founder and ceo chase adam talked to techrepublic about searching for the most meaningful startup idea and transforming medical treatment with his crowdfunding platform by lyndsey gilpin  june    am pst  email print reddit delicious digg pinterest stumbleupon google plus chase adam is the founder of the medical crowdfunding site watsi image chase adam a woman got on the bus at a stop on a winding road in costa rica she asked the other riders for donations for her sons medical care it wasnt an uncommon occurrence as many people beg for money every day the difference was how much money she received she had her sons medical records and photos with her she passed them around the bus answered questions and gained trust so the people offered up fundschase adam was on that bus and at that moment watching these people give money to this womans cause he had an epiphany in  watsi was born named for the town in which the bus stopped watsi is a global crowdfunding platform that allows anyone to donate money to fund lifechanging medical treatments for people in need give as little as  or fund the entire project and receive an update of the outcome of the treatment ive always wanted to work on a problem for an organization that i really and truly believe is more important than i am adam said watsi matters more than i do and that is inspiring i care so much so ill never quit ive been faced with a lot of hard questions in life and watsi has never been one of them adam said he was always searching for a project to be extremely passionate about throughout his time in school he had side entrepreneurial projects the most successful of which was a screen printing company but he found his true love traveling in college as well when he studied abroad in chile and traveled around south and central america a big reason he went to chile to study was his passion for the water and surfing which has always been an important part of his life after chile adam studied in barbados to learn about caribbean culture and of course surf some more in his spare time he interned in washington dc after college at a private sector intelligence company it was very intellectually stimulating work but i didnt feel like  happy with the company and project i was serving he said he thought a nonprofit was where he should head next so adam moved to haiti where he started a nonprofit healthcare program that imported multivitamins and used loan officers to deliver them to people around the country particularly expectant mothers and children the program is still in place today something that gives him great pride after that he joined the peace corps and served for two and a half years in a tiny town in costa rica where he became fluent in spanish and worked for several microfinance institutions but during that time he started to become disenchanted with the nonprofit worldthe traveling gave him an enormous amount of perspective but it finally wore on himthe reason i was traveling is that i was searching for something im kind of a romantic in that sense i guess adam said i think watsi is that thing and im not sure if it found me or it was because i was searching after the idea for watsi was born adam wanted to go back to san francisco the nonprofit and nongovernmental organization ngo world moved too slowly he said and there was too much bureaucracy meanwhile he viewed the tech world of silicon valley as the opposite — an everchanging environment filled with incredibly smart people who were motivated to change the world watsi was designed to model a startup but as a nonprofit eight volunteers on three continents built the platform after two months they were accepted into y combinator and became the startup accelerators first nonprofit raising a  million philanthropic round adam quit his finance job and by  watsi grew  times what it originally was and is sustaining off of the funding and donations by people through the website it has since raised over  million for patients who have lifethreatening ailments that always have a high probability of success and cost less than  to treat they are posted by trusted medical partners ontheground that adam and the watsi team have forged close relationships with in the early days i knew the first  or  patients by name i recognized them by face i helped write their profiles adam said those first patients always stick out in my mindespecially one yearold girl from nepal who needed hand surgery because of a severe burn she looked very angry in her photo adam said and they contacted her to see if she wanted to upload another she said no her  surgery was funded and in her update photo she was beaming looking like a completely different child she told the watsi team i used to not like school because i had no friends but now i have friends because i have all my fingers that was only the beginning to date there are hundreds of profiles on the site asking for often simple procedures that drastically improve lives for instance paul just needs a treatment for his leg fracture infection so he doesnt have to have it amputated amni a sixyearold from guatemala needs a  surgery that would prevent longterm damage to her kidneys the watsi team travels around the world to visit hospitals and patients who are using the platform and adam went along at first he has since taken a break trying to hold down the fort in san francisco but he said hes starting to get the itch to travel again i think im extremely fortunate to work with such smart and passionate people on something we all care deeply about he said its such a rare opportunity in lifenow he just has to scale it adam can never see leaving watsi but he wants the company and its mission to outgrow him — in his mind that would be the ultimate success in his own wordswhat are some of your hobbiesits always been surfing everywhere ive lived except for dc its the one opportunity where i can turn my brain off which is needed from time to time my dad and brother are surfers they started teaching me when i was  or  it really started when i was  and i could drive myself to the beach my family takes an annual trip to mexico a surf trip every yearwhat is some of the best advice you have for aspiring entrepreneursthe best jobs are when you find something that you work on that you care about more than yourself and im stealing this quotethe best way to make money doing something you love is just start doing it ive always wanted to start a startup an organization that matters you dont have to quit your job and raise money just do it on the side never give uphow do you focus on a projectone of the unique things about my role at watsi is im always doing something different and thats really motivating theres always a different challenge so i try to learn things the hard way how do you unplugi try to meditate and im terrible at it i tried to get into it in the peace corps two and a half years in a tiny community where no one speaks english you can go crazy surfing is my form of
