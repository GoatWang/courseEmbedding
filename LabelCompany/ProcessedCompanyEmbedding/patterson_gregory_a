gunn” was the benefit cosmetic’s challenge where the designers created pieces for real women with real issues the blowpro team created hairstyles for the women that fit their personalities and lifestyles this messy fishtail bun is perfect for an elegant yet trendy style that can be easily recreated at home   step  using a curling iron begin to build body in the hair by curling ″ sections throughout entire head spray textstyle dry texture spray on each section and you can choose to gently back comb with a styling brush for added texture   step   once you’ve curled and backcombed gather hair into a high ponytail and secure with an elastic separate  ″ section of hair to fishtail braid clip away wrap remaining hair around the elastic and pin to create your messy bun   step   fishtail the section you left out of the messy bun you can also choose to create a classic braid secure the end of the braid with a clear elastic and wrap around the messy bun pinning into bun to secure nick approves step  finish the look by spraying after blow strong hold finishing spray straightening iron vs curling iron waves   last night’s episode of lifetime’s under the gunn featured some spring inspired loose curl styles waves can be created using two different techniques   straightening iron technique   “the great benefit of using a straightening iron to create waves is that it produces more defined longer lasting waves once mastered it becomes the best way to achieve the beachwave look in minutes” gregory patterson step  to boost shine and add hold spray each section with blowout serious nonstick hairspray this spray’s formula is light enough to be used as a working spray when using irons it drys in seconds and is ready for the iron to pass step  clamp the straightener halfway down a section and turn it back on itself  keep the iron at an angle and guide it down the section step  you can continue this through the entire head of hair or select pieces to curl then using a dab of mane tame soft pomade run fingers through the curls to break them up for a tousled loose waves look   curling iron technique   “curling irons on the other hand provide a looser less defined curl that doesn’t last as long so this tool is best for a soft curl look” gregory patterson step  prep for your curls by following the same first step mentioned above step  when using a barrel curling iron whether it is clipless or not we like to use the wrap technique as demonstrated by gregory in the above picture so take your section sizes can vary and begin to wrap around the curling iron leaving the end out you can hold on to the end this will create a curl with a little less definition which will give the look overall a more modern appeal step  again curl the entire head or choose some pieces to add flirty fun texture   there are steps to achieve waves flat iron technique vs curling iron either way blowpro will help you create this spring’s trending style   shop the look
