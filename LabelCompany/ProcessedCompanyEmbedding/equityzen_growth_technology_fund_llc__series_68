future results investment returns and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions investors units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost principal investment strategy under normal circumstances the trust will invest at least  of the value of its assets in largecap equity securities the trust aims to provide a portfolio of securities that the sponsor believes includes large high quality us growth companies the us listed common stocks held by the trust may include the common stocks of us and non us companies the sponsor believes that companies that exhibit strong growth characteristics may demonstrate an ability to accelerate revenues returns and profits this acceleration relative to a firm’s peer group usually reflects an innovative product or service an expanding geographic operating footprint or a competitive advantage enabling the firm to capture additional market share however there can be no assurance that any security held by the trust will meet the trust objective as a result of this strategy the trust is concentrated in the consumer products sector and invests significantly in the health care sector selection criteria the trust’s portfolio is constructed by the sponsor using the methodology described below • begin with an initial universe of all uslisted growth securities • focus on factors including but not limited to valuation the sponsor favors companies whose valuations appear to be attractive based on measures such as pricetoearnings pricetobook and priceto cash flow growth the sponsor may screen for companies with a history of and prospects for above average growth of dividends sales and earnings profitability the sponsor may screen for companies with a history of consistent and high profitability as measured by returnonassets returnonequity gross margin and net margin industry leadership the sponsor favors companies that possess a strong competitive position among their domestic and global peers balance sheet the sponsor favors companies that possess overall financial strength and exhibit balance sheet improvements relative to their peers and the marketplace cashflow adequacy the sponsor favors companies with recent earnings and operating cashflow significantly higher than the dividends paid as of the company’s most recent financial reporting period • select a portfolio of securities from the remaining universe by selecting the most attractive candidates as determined by the sponsor from each sector for expected performance and risk while maintaining diversification with limits on sector and market capitalization risks and other considerations as with all investments you may lose some or all of your investment in the trust no assurance can be given that the trust’s investment objective will be achieved the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these • securities prices can be volatile the value of your investment may fall over time market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include stock market movements purchases or sales of securities by the trust government policies litigation and changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of the securities’ issuer or even perceptions of the issuer units of the trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency • share prices or dividend rates on the securities in the trust may decline during the life of the trust there is no guarantee that share prices of the securities in the trust will not decline and that the issuers of the securities will declare dividends in the future and if declared whether they will remain at current levels or increase over time • the trust is concentrated in the consumer products sector as a result the factors that impact the consumer products sector will likely have a greater effect on this trust than on a more broadly diversified trust general risks of companies in the consumer products sector include cyclicality of revenues and earnings economic recession currency fluctuations changing consumer tastes extensive competition product liability litigation and increased government regulation a weak economy and its effect on consumer spending would adversely affect companies in the consumer products sector • the trust invests significantly in the health care sector as a result the factors that impact the health care sector will likely have a greater effect on this trust than on a more broadly diversified trust general risks of companies in the health care sector include extensive competition generic drug sales the loss of patent protection product liability litigation and increased government regulation • inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from investments • the sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio the trust will generally hold and may when creating additional units continue to buy the same securities even though a security’s outlook market value or yield may have changed see “investment risks” in part a of the prospectus and “risk factors” in part b of the prospectus for additional information please see the trust prospectus for more complete risk information unit

performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk

one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of

comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its

morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful
