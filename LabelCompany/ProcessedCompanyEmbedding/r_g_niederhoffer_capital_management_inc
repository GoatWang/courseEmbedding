trader toby crabel worked at the hedge fund at the same time he then opened r g niederhoffer capital management inc rgncm a hedge fund known as a managed futures fund or commodity futures trading

portfolios in its earliest years in the s rgncm slumped during the internet bubble from its establishment through  his firms returns were essentially flat this led niederhoffer to adopt dozens of new

management were  million trading strategyedit niederhoffer uses an investment strategy known as shortterm trading he developed his strategy after tracking and analyzing shortterm trading patterns he wrote the original computer code to test and run his complicated highfrequency automatictrading strategy in over  financial and commodity markets in developed countries he is of the view that movements in stock currency and commodity prices lead to patterns of shortterm investor responses that can be anticipated niederhoffer’s computerized trading models are based on a belief in the presence of cognitive biases in the human brain which in his view cause investors and the models they create to behave predictably he believes that other shortterm investors generally engage in certain predictable behavior they overemphasize recent experience when they make decisions they hate to lose even more than they love to win their behavior becomes increasingly predictable as markets become more volatile and when the investors are emotional they engage in herdlike behavior and sell stocks when they are at their lowest level and buy stocks when they are at their highest level the firms trading models do not focus on company fundamentals or macroeconomic trends niederhoffers computer models analyze the realtime data as it comes in such as volume and price of every major market and most of the largest stocks the models make decisions as to what the probability is that a particular market may rise or fall over a period of the next few hours to the next few days as with the way an airplane is flown the models are flown by autopilot most of the time with a pilot watching over them to make corrections if need be the models focus among other things not just on the price of a security but on the path that a price has taken to get to where it is they are premised on the notion that to be effective the quantitative strategy must be applied and the emotion of the trader has to be stripped from the process niederhoffers strategy thrives on volatility because it brings out emotional predictable herd behavior in investors his firms own trades generally range in duration from several hours to a week or two averaging a day and a half niederhoffers program seeks to decrease its risk when the amount it could lose goes past certain thresholds and his firms risk management committee can override the program to reduce risk when it feels it is appropriate at times by buying options awardsedit r g niederhoffer capital management inc was futures magazine top trader of  roy

developed his strategy after tracking and analyzing shortterm trading patterns he wrote the original computer code to test and run his complicated highfrequency automatictrading strategy in over  financial and commodity markets in developed countries he is of the view that movements in stock currency and commodity prices lead to patterns of shortterm investor responses that can be anticipated niederhoffer’s computerized trading models are based on a belief in the presence of cognitive biases in the human brain which in his view cause investors and the models they create to behave predictably he believes that other shortterm investors generally engage in certain predictable behavior they overemphasize recent experience when they make decisions they hate to lose even more than they love to win their behavior becomes increasingly predictable as markets become more volatile and when the investors are emotional they engage in herdlike behavior and sell stocks when they are at their lowest level and buy stocks when they are at their highest level the firms trading models do not focus on company fundamentals or macroeconomic trends niederhoffers computer models analyze the realtime data as it comes in such as volume and price of every major market and most of the largest stocks the models make decisions as to what the probability is that a particular market may rise or fall over a period of the next few hours to the next few days as with the way an airplane is flown the models are flown by autopilot most of the time with a pilot watching over them to make corrections if need be the models focus among other things not just on the price of a security but on the path that a price has taken to get to where it is they are premised on the notion that to be effective the quantitative strategy must be applied and the emotion of the trader has to be stripped from the process niederhoffers strategy thrives on volatility because it brings out emotional predictable herd behavior in investors his firms own trades generally range in duration from several hours to a week or two averaging a day and a half niederhoffers program seeks to decrease its risk when the amount it could lose goes past certain thresholds and his firms risk management committee can override the program to reduce risk when it feels it is appropriate at times by buying options

wrote the original computer code to test and run his complicated highfrequency automatictrading strategy in over  financial and commodity markets in developed countries he is of the view that movements in stock currency and commodity prices lead to patterns of shortterm investor responses that can be anticipated niederhoffer’s computerized trading models are based on a belief in the presence of cognitive biases in the human brain which in his view cause investors and the models they create to behave predictably he believes that other shortterm investors generally engage in certain predictable behavior they overemphasize recent experience when they make decisions they hate to lose even more than they love to win their behavior becomes increasingly predictable as markets become more volatile and when the investors are emotional they engage in herdlike behavior and sell stocks when they are at their lowest level and buy stocks when they are at their highest level the firms trading models do not focus on company fundamentals or macroeconomic trends niederhoffers computer models analyze the realtime data as it comes in such as volume and price of every major market and most of the largest stocks the models make decisions as to what the probability is that a particular market may rise or fall over a period of the next few hours to the next few days as with the way an airplane is flown the models are flown by autopilot most of the time with a pilot watching over them to make corrections if need be the models focus among other things not just on the price of a security but on the path that a price has taken to get to where it is they are premised on the notion that to be effective the quantitative strategy must be applied and the emotion of the trader has to be stripped from the process niederhoffers strategy thrives on volatility because it brings out emotional predictable herd behavior in investors his firms own trades generally range in duration from several hours to a week or two averaging a day and a half niederhoffers program seeks to decrease its risk when the amount it could lose goes past certain thresholds and his firms risk management

wrote the original computer code to test and run his complicated highfrequency automatictrading strategy in over  financial and commodity markets in developed countries he is of the view that movements in stock currency and commodity prices lead to patterns of shortterm investor responses that can be anticipated niederhoffer’s computerized trading models are based on a belief in the presence of cognitive biases in the human brain which in his view cause investors and the models they create to behave predictably he believes that other shortterm investors generally engage in certain predictable behavior they overemphasize recent experience when they make decisions they hate to lose even more than they love to win their behavior becomes increasingly predictable as markets become more volatile and when the investors are emotional they engage in herdlike behavior and sell stocks when they are at their lowest level and buy stocks when they are at their highest level the firms trading models do not focus on company fundamentals or macroeconomic trends niederhoffers computer models analyze the realtime data as it comes in such as volume and price of every major market and most of the largest stocks the models make decisions as to what the probability is that a particular market may rise or fall over a period of the next few hours to the next few days as with the way an airplane is flown the models are flown by autopilot most of the time with a pilot watching over them to make corrections if need be the models focus among other things not just on the price of a security but on the path that a price has taken to get to where it is they are premised on the notion that to be effective the quantitative strategy must be applied and the emotion of the trader has to be stripped from the process niederhoffers strategy thrives on volatility because it brings out emotional predictable herd behavior in investors his firms own trades generally range in duration from several hours to a week or two averaging a day and a half niederhoffers program seeks to decrease its risk when the amount it could lose goes past certain thresholds and his firms risk management committee can override the program to reduce risk when it feels it is appropriate at times by buying options awardsedit r g niederhoffer capital management inc was futures magazine top trader of  roy

developed his strategy after tracking and analyzing shortterm trading patterns he wrote the original computer code to test and run his complicated highfrequency automatictrading strategy in over  financial and commodity markets in developed countries he is of the view that movements in stock currency and commodity prices lead to patterns of shortterm investor responses that can be anticipated niederhoffer’s computerized trading models are based on a belief in the presence of cognitive biases in the human brain which in his view cause investors and the models they create to behave predictably he believes that other shortterm investors generally engage in certain predictable behavior they overemphasize recent experience when they make decisions they hate to lose even more than they love to win their behavior becomes increasingly predictable as markets become more volatile and when the investors are emotional they engage in herdlike behavior and sell stocks when they are at their lowest level and buy stocks when they are at their highest level the firms trading models do not focus on company fundamentals or macroeconomic trends niederhoffers computer models analyze the realtime data as it comes in such as volume and price of every major market and most of the largest stocks the models make decisions as to what the probability is that a particular market may rise or fall over a period of the next few hours to the next few days as with the way an airplane is flown the models are flown by autopilot most of the time with a pilot watching over them to make corrections if need be the models focus among other things not just on the price of a security but on the path that a price has taken to get to where it is they are premised on the notion that to be effective the quantitative strategy must be applied and the emotion of the trader has to be stripped from the process niederhoffers strategy thrives on volatility because it brings out emotional predictable herd behavior in investors his firms own trades generally range in duration from several hours to a week or two averaging a day and a half niederhoffers program seeks to decrease its risk when the amount it could lose goes past certain thresholds and his firms risk management committee can override the program to reduce risk when it feels it is appropriate at times by buying options
