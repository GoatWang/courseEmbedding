axovant alzheimers drug bought by vivek ramaswamy  business insider science bi intelligence events trending tech insider finance politics strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × a yearold former wall streeter bought an alzheimers drug that failed clinical trials — and now his company is worth  billion erin brodwin jun    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print stockmonkeyscom a company owned by former hedge fund manager vivek ramaswamy recently snatched up the rights to an unnamed dementia drug — the same drug that pharmaceutical giant glaxosmithkline gave up on after spending years testing it since dropping  million on the drug which glaxo referred to simply as sb a few months ago ramaswamys company axovant sciences now has a market value approaching  billion the new york times reports the companys initial public stock offering last week ranks as the biggest ever in the biotechnology industry according to forbes the reason glaxo likely gave up on the drug is simple it didnt appear to work at least not when used alone after testing it for months in more than a dozen clinical trials the drug showed no effects when given to people alone but in one trial when it was given to people along with a widely used drug called aricept which is prescribed to treat some of the symptoms of alzheimers disease such as confusion and memory loss they showed a slower loss over time of some measures of brain functioning and daily capabilities than those who only took the aricept the times reports ramaswamy took that trial and ran with it we think we have a great drug candidate” ramaswamy told forbes if this drug is approved we think its going to make a huge difference for a lot of patients and ultimately there is a huge need and a great team here to do it the new drug which ramaswamys company is calling rvt would be taken once a day and according to forbes matthew herper and nathan vardi doesnt seem to cause onerous side effects rvt has been tested in  clinical trials so far in one of them a patient randomized controlled clinical trial the highest standard as far as drug testing goes when patients were given the drug along with the other alzheimers drug aricept it appeared to benefit cognition and patients’ daily functioning ability  months later forbes reports full of promise or full of hype some in the biotech community however arent quite so thrilled with ramaswamys approach he gathered a team together and without recruiting a single patient for a pivotal study of a marginal drug designed to treat symptoms of the disease just raised  million in an upsized ipo that came in at the top of the range and promptly gyrated much higher today as investors bought in writes john carroll in a post for fiercebiotech a watchdog news group of which he serves as editorinchief ramaswamys company writes carroll has no track record no experience and one questionable product given the fact that glaxosmithkline had a chance to take a look at this drug in the clinic and concluded that they couldnt do better than selling it for lunch money the ipo terms illustrate the kind of overnight riches a select few can find on wall street provided you have the right kind of friends with money carroll writes axovant plans to begin another trial testing the drug which its calling rvt this time using the generic version of aricept called donezepil up next the first drug of its kind was just approved and it could signal a massive change for pharmaceuticals also read a revolutionary blood test shows you all the viruses

ramaswamy turned  million into  billion with axovant sciences’ initial public offering now featured as the cover story on forbes’ sept  issue ramaswamy looks to do it again twitterforbes magazine photo indian american entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy  shocked a lot of people when he turned  million into  billion with axovant sciences’ initial public offeringnow as featured in the sept  cover story for forbes magazine ramaswamy is poised to repeat historyin june ramaswamy was at the forefront of the biggest ipo in the history of the american biotechnology industry the bermudabased company with offices also in new york has just one product a dementia drug to treat alzheimer’s axovant was formed eight months prior to the ipo and raised roughly  million to develop the drug that was essentially abandoned by glaxosmithkline by the end of the first day on the new york stock exchange axovant had a market capitalization of about  billion ramaswamy had purchased the drug from glaxo for  milliona graduate of harvard college with an ab in biology and the recipient of a law degree from yale law school ramaswamy is a former hedge fund partnerthere were skeptics who wondered how a company could be worth so much the stock had dipped  percent below the ipo price by the beginning of the monthand while ramaswamy was touting that axovant’s goal “is to be the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of dementia” they had yet to generate any revenue even as other companies were creating drugs to compete with his company’s productbut now as axovant drifts to the backdrop ramaswamy is up to his old tricks rescuing the pharmaceutical industry’s forgotten drugs according to forbesramaswamy said axovant is the first step in a broader mission to liberate abandoned or deprioritized drugs the report saidit’s not unprecedented drugs like lipitor and imbruvica have also almost faced extinction before being presented anew to the world ramaswamy hopes to do the same for dozens of companies “this will be the highest return on investment endeavor ever taken up in the pharmaceutical industry” he boasted in the forbes report “it will be a pipeline every bit as deep and diverse as the most promising pharma company in the world but with a capital efficiency that is unprecedented”as an analyst ramaswamy noticed there were several forgotten drugs that he would have liked to invest in but couldn’t they were trapped in big pharmaceutical firms that had shelved them for strategic or bureaucratic reasons or in small biotechnology firms that had to focus all their resources on a single product no matter how good option no  was the forbes report saidthe indian american accomplished successful returns with his company roivant sciences’  percent stake in axovant as well as turning an  million purchase of drugs to treat liver virus hepatitis b into  million in arbutus biopharma with roivant in may he bought a psychosis drug for  million from arena pharmaceuticals and later partnered with a duke university group known for inventing raredisease drugsaxovant speculators will have to wait until  before they hear any new drug data for alzheimer’s during which the stock could drift without a bona fide catalyst said forbes under the best possible scenario real benefit to alzheimer’s patients is years awaybut it would be a mistake to get stuck in the weeds of roivant’s alzheimer’s efforts ramaswamy’s approach is long term and broad in scope and even if axovant’s efforts fail the money raised will help with finding other compounds of drugs that could be more

harvard university vivek ramaswamy realized that even in cambridge mass which boasts of two worldclass universities — harvard and the massachusetts institute of technology — students with entrepreneurial aspirations had difficulty connecting with potential partners and investors he decided to do something about it in  his final year at harvard ramaswamy partnered with fellow student travis may and cofounded studentbusinessescom a website to connect students with the entrepreneurial ecosystem the duo also developed two supporting software products in  they sold their business to the usbased kauffman foundation which is focused on advancing innovation and training future business leaders kauffman later rebranded studentbusinessescom as istart in a conversation with india knowledgewharton ramaswamy who is currently a student at the yale law school shared his views on entrepreneurship and his own business ventures ramaswamy describes himself as an “accidental entrepreneur” and says that the experience of starting something new can be a valuable in itself an edited version of the interview follows india knowledgewharton what are your views on entrepreneurship in america vivek ramaswamy this may sound trite but i believe it to be true entrepreneurship is the fabric of what america is all about the recent resurgence in entrepreneurship is a resurgence of something quintessentially american it has been responsible for driving this country in years past and will drive it forward in the future as well the shift of the entrepreneurial age towards a younger age bracket indicates a potential uptick going forward as these younger aspiring entrepreneurs gain more experience india knowledgewharton how do you see the current entrepreneurial resurgence as being different from earlier ramaswamy i would think the correlation between an era of increased globalization and an increased desire to participate in an entrepreneurial endeavor is not a coincidence when interconnectedness is at a peak due to technological advances the ability to spawn something new is slightly easier india knowledgewharton in your view how are american universities adjusting to this new trend ramaswamy today with the internet social networking and other media people are becoming increasingly interconnected making the original hotbeds of entrepreneurship not as distant as they once were the emergence of webbased tools to achieve that interconnectedness is spawning entrepreneurship programs at universities across the country our business … studentbusinessescom was focused on the issue of university entrepreneurship the number of universities in the past five years that have added either business plan competitions or entrepreneurship education programs has dwarfed the same fiveyear trend in any period before it at least to the extent that i am aware most of these programs are actually at universities that are outside of the typical socalled “hotbed” regions i think a big part of the reason for this is what the internet and other technology and media have accomplished in connecting those places that are more geographically distant from the traditional hotbeds india knowledgewharton are you suggesting for example that while a place like silicon valley would have been geographically or academically inaccessible to people one to two decades ago it is now possible to connect folks in disparate geographies to work collaboratively ramaswamy exactly it is an ability to access what is happening in those places typically known for entrepreneurship and to use that to plant a seed in a wide range of other places india knowledgewharton the objective of studentbusinessescom was to connect young students with the entrepreneurial ecosystem and tap into their energy some research however shows that the majority of successful entrepreneurs have had years of experience and also industry knowhow before they went out on their own how did you envision bridging that gap ramaswamy it is a distinction we were acutely cognizant of at the time we started studentbusinessescom some folks we approached at the initial stages to join us as advisors and consultants told us that they didn’t believe in our concept because they felt that a person needed to have substantial industry experience in order to become an entrepreneur knowledgewharton high school we viewed it a little differently we felt that young people including those coming out of the university programs are at a stage in their lives when they are able to take the biggest risks they also have a fresh perspective that’s not colored by industry experience that inexperience or freshness can be catalyzing of course it could potentially impose limitations on the types of things that young students may envision themselves doing we wanted to tap into that innovative lens that younger people at universities possess recognizing the value that experience could add one of our major initial theses was that the experience of starting something new can be a valuable experience in itself india knowledgewharton even if the venture doesn’t result in anything ramaswamy absolutely that act of trying can be its own experience and that was part of our thesis from the very beginning in terms of the value created for a student by founding his or her own startup company india knowledgewharton you launched studentbusinessescom in  the semester before you graduated from harvard times were good then economically we didn’t think about the world as we do today how did you and your cofounder travis may manage to get ahead of the curve did you see this coming ramaswamy actually it was a very difficult time to start a business even though the message of entrepreneurship becoming all the more important was not lost on people the conditions of fear that existed at that time were somewhat of an adversity that we faced in launching the company india knowledgewharton studentbusinessescom paired up entrepreneuriallyminded students with people who were interested in their concepts can you tell us more about it ramaswamy the site — studentbusinessescom — had two searchable databases — “businesses in the game” and “students on the roster” aspiring and current entrepreneurs could join either of these for free while entrepreneurs could post a profile that described their business and what they were looking for on “businesses in the game” those interested in joining a startup could sign up on to “students on the roster” over time our site also expanded to include two softwareasaservice products — b plan studio and startup space b plan studio enabled university entrepreneurship programs to conduct a business plan competition in a seamless fashion and in a way that preserved the data and the information that was gained in that competition startup space enabled universities and in particular business schools to create internal networks of aspiring entrepreneurial students on their campuses india knowledgewharton studentbusinessescom built these proprietary software platforms ramaswamy yes we built that software which was modeled on some of the same aspects as our website india knowledgewharton in the studentbusinessescom model the students sign up for free while the external professionals who are interested in tapping into these students pay for a subscription how were you able to convince people to pay for another site subscription ramaswamy the primary users of the site from the nonstudent perspective were actually professional service providers who were seeking to expand their businesses to include startups for instance law firms that were looking at targeting a new clientele or web development and it consulting firms that were generating revenue by serving large corporations but were interested in taking a little bit more risk in working with younger companies but it was never our main objective to market this aspect we wanted to build a strong database and network of student entrepreneurs we were acquired within two years of our launch so the process of going beyond that first step perhaps lies in the hands of our acquirer the kauffman foundation india knowledgewharton could you talk a little bit about the acquisition of studentbusinessescom by the kauffman foundation ramaswamy one of our objectives from the very start was to not only succeed in our own right as a business but also from a more social entrepreneurship perspective to enable other businesses to do the same thing it is that spirit that led the kauffman foundation to be the best acquirer they are the world’s largest foundation devoted to entrepreneurship and one of the largest foundations in the united states i think one of the reasons that kauffman looked at us was to find a platform around which to organize some of their activities including but not limited to their expansion into the university entrepreneurship space at the end of the day our consideration was not just a financial one but the knowledge that our platform would be taken in the direction we had in mind from day one — fostering entrepreneurship among young people across this country india knowledgewharton can you tell us about the experiences that have shaped you as an entrepreneur ramaswamy from a personal standpoint i consider myself much more of an accidental entrepreneur i was involved in the entrepreneurship club at harvard but i heard of it only because it was new on campus india knowledgewharton but the club obviously didn’t fulfill what you wanted it to ramaswamy i saw so much potential among the aspirations of the students who were at harvard i suspected it would be the same at universities across the country these aspirations weren’t being served and harnessed india knowledgewharton is there an example of something frustrating that happened or a specific point when you and travis said “we can do this better” what was the spark that made it into something more ramaswamy we observed for example that there were a lot of people at harvard who were ideadriven but didn’t have technical skills to accomplish what they wanted to accomplish they were always looking among their own community for people who had technical skills to help them launch a new idea that they had india knowledgewharton the next facebook ramaswamy exactly and the fact that facebook was launched during my time at harvard probably impacted other people’s aspirations students had these great ideas they didn’t have the technical ability to do it themselves but they knew what they wanted to accomplish and all they needed was to find the right persons except that harvard was filled with a bunch of similar people however right down the street you have massachusetts institute of technology mit which has a higher concentration of people with worldclass technical capabilities though separated by only two subway stops this distance was enough of a barrier to limit the type of communication that should have been taking place if that barrier existed within cambridge among these two heavyweight institutions one could only imagine the gulf at a national level supports kws innovation content citing knowledgewharton close for personal use please use the following citations to quote for personal

result in anything ramaswamy absolutely that act of trying can be its own experience and that was part of our thesis from the very beginning in terms of the value created for a student by founding his or her own startup company india knowledgewharton you launched studentbusinessescom in  the semester before you graduated from harvard times were good then economically we didn’t think about the world as we do today how did you and your cofounder travis may manage to get ahead of the curve did you see this coming ramaswamy actually it was a very difficult time to start a business even though the message of entrepreneurship becoming all the more important was not lost on people the conditions of fear that existed at that time were somewhat of an adversity that we faced in launching the company india knowledgewharton studentbusinessescom paired up entrepreneuriallyminded students with people who were interested in their concepts can you tell us more about it ramaswamy the site — studentbusinessescom — had two searchable databases — “businesses in the game” and “students on the roster” aspiring and current entrepreneurs could join either of these for free while entrepreneurs could post a profile that described their business and what they were looking for on “businesses in the game” those interested in joining a startup could sign up on to “students on the roster” over time our site also expanded to include two softwareasaservice products — b plan studio and startup space b plan studio enabled university entrepreneurship programs to conduct a business plan competition in a seamless fashion and in a way that preserved the data and the information that was gained in that competition startup space enabled universities and in particular business schools to create internal networks of aspiring entrepreneurial students on their campuses india knowledgewharton studentbusinessescom built these proprietary software platforms ramaswamy yes we built that software which was modeled on some of the same aspects as our website india knowledgewharton in the studentbusinessescom model the students sign up for free while the external professionals who are interested in tapping into these students pay for a subscription how were you able to convince people to pay for another site subscription ramaswamy the primary users of the site from the nonstudent perspective were actually professional service providers who were seeking to expand their businesses to include startups for instance law firms that were looking at targeting a new clientele or web development and it consulting firms that were generating revenue by serving large corporations but were interested in taking a little bit more risk in working with younger companies but it was never our main objective to market this aspect we wanted to build a strong database and network of student entrepreneurs we were acquired within two years of our launch so the process of going beyond that first step perhaps lies in the hands of our acquirer the kauffman foundation india knowledgewharton could you talk a little bit about the acquisition of studentbusinessescom by the kauffman foundation ramaswamy one of our objectives from the very start was to not only succeed in our own right as a business but also from a more social entrepreneurship perspective to enable other businesses to do the same thing it is that spirit that led the kauffman foundation to be the best acquirer they are the world’s largest foundation devoted to entrepreneurship and one of the largest foundations in the united states i think one of the reasons that kauffman looked at us was to find a platform around which to organize some of their activities including but not limited to their expansion into the university entrepreneurship space at the end of the day our consideration was not just a financial one but the knowledge that our platform would be taken in the direction we had in mind from day one — fostering entrepreneurship among young people across this country india knowledgewharton can you tell us about the experiences that have shaped you as an entrepreneur ramaswamy from a personal standpoint i consider myself much more of an accidental entrepreneur i was involved in the entrepreneurship club at harvard but i heard of it only because it was new on campus india knowledgewharton but the club obviously didn’t fulfill what you wanted it to ramaswamy i saw so much potential among the aspirations of the students who were at harvard i suspected it would be the same at universities across the country these aspirations weren’t being served and harnessed india knowledgewharton is there an example of something frustrating that happened or a specific point when you and travis said “we can do this better” what was the spark that made it into something more ramaswamy we observed for example that there were a lot of people at harvard who were ideadriven but didn’t have technical skills to accomplish what they wanted to accomplish they were always looking among their own community for people who had technical skills to help them launch a new idea that they had india knowledgewharton the next facebook ramaswamy exactly and the fact that facebook was launched during my time at harvard probably impacted other people’s aspirations students had these great ideas they didn’t have the technical ability to do it themselves but they knew what they wanted to accomplish and all they needed was to find the right persons except that harvard was filled with a bunch of similar people however right down the street you have massachusetts institute of technology mit which has a higher concentration of people with worldclass technical capabilities though separated by only two subway stops this distance was enough of a barrier to limit the type of communication that should have been taking place if that barrier existed within cambridge among these two heavyweight institutions one could only imagine the gulf at a national level supports kws innovation content citing knowledgewharton close for personal use please use the following citations to quote for personal

ramaswamy wears a suit by stone crosby with shirt by calvin klein in june vivek ramaswamy a yearold former hedge fund partner cancelled his honeymoon plans to hike in the french and swiss alps he instead brought his bride to stand beside him as he rang the bell of the new york stock exchange to launch the biggest initial public offering in the history of the american biotechnology industry what could be more romantic than a few hundred million in paper gains in a single dayramaswamy’s bermudabased company axovant sciences had been formed only eight months earlier but here it was raising  million to develop an alzheimer’s drug that had been all but abandoned by giant pharma glaxosmithkline on the first day of trading the stock almost doubled giving axovant a market capitalisation of nearly  billion considering that ramaswamy had persuaded glaxo to part with the unproven remedy for just  million upfront the newlyweds were ecstatic as was a veritable wedding party of hedge fund pals who had followed ramaswamy into the stock yet as quickly as it started the honeymoon was over ‘why would glaxo sell off a promising drug for so little’ critics asked and how could a company with ten employees two of whom were ramaswamy’s mother and brother be worth so much experts analysts and the collective blogosphere quickly piled on and axovant’s shares went into free fall by early september they were trading  percent below the ipo price the naysayers have positioned the young and charming ramaswamy as the poster boy for a biotech bubble that’s not hard to do when the ishares nasdaq biotechnology index has surged  percent in five years compared with a  percent gain for the broader nasdaq index and  percent for the sp  scary numbers despite a plethora of real breakthroughs including cancer drugs that shrink tumours cures for hepatitis c and treatments that replace defective genes and they’d be positively terrifying if the government stops approving or paying high prices for so many drugsbut this creeping fear ignores the full scope of what ramaswamy is up to rescuing the pharmaceutical industry’s forgotten drugs whether or not the axovant drug works the ipo according to ramaswamy is “a first step on a broader mission” to liberate abandoned or deprioritised drugs that routinely languish in the pipelines of pharma companies “it’s an ethical problem of an underappre ciated magnitude” says ramaswamy “so many drugs that would have been of use to society are cast aside certain drugs have gone by the wayside for reasons that have nothing to do with their underlying merits”leaning on his wall street back ground and armed with a  million war chest ramaswamy is building a portfolio not of stocks but of hasbeen drugs that he grabs for “pennies on the dollar” freeriding on the billions in research that pharma sometimes sinks into failed trials using a pharmaceutical holding company he formed last year roivant sciences ramaswamy hopes to spin out dozens of companies much as he did with axovant “this will be the highest return on investment endeavour ever taken up in the pharmaceutical industry” he boasts “it will be a pipeline every bit as deep and diverse as the most promising pharma company in the world but with a capital efficiency that is unprecedented”there’s precedent lipitor the bestselling drug ever was almost abandoned and imbruvica the drug behind abbvie’s  billion purchase of pharmacyclics in may was bought in  as part of a  million dealat least a dozen successful companies have been built around the purchase of a forgotten drugand ramaswamy has quickly established a track record roivant sciences’s  percent stake in axovant and its alzheimer’s pill codenamed rvt has produced a  percent paper return on its initial  million investment before that ramaswamy turned a  million purchase of several drugs to treat the liver virus hepatitis b into a  million stake in arbutus biopharma a  percent paper return in may roivant scooped up a drug for psychosis for  million from arena pharmaceuticals it also partnered with a duke university group with a track record for inventing raredisease drugs a whirlwind of such deals has made ramaswamy a member of the forbes  under  list biopharma’s youngest chief executive he may soon be its youngest billionaire forbes estimates that roivant is worth  billion making its millennial founder’s  percent or so stake worth some  million ramaswamy who just turned  has bigger aspirations roivant he says will become the “berkshire hathaway of drug development” vivek ramaswamy is any parent’s dream he is the eldest son in a family of south indian immigrants his father was a company man at general electric and his mother worked for merck and scheringplough as a geriatric psychiatrist ramaswamy was valedictorian at his high school in cincinnati an accomplished pianist who played for the alzheimer’s patients his mom treated and a nationally ranked junior tennis player whose serve could hit  mph at harvard he was chairman of the harvard political union worked in the lab of renowned stem cell scientist douglas melton and took the stage as a libertarian hiphop artist named ‘da vek’ he also cofounded a company studentbusinessescom which connects startups advisors and investors and sold it to the ewing marion kauffman foundation which offers it as a free tool renamed istartbut ramaswamy who graduated in biology wanted to change the world he thought of becoming a doctor or a researcher but didn’t want to spend another decade in school then he discovered hedge funds where a yearold can control hundreds of millions “when i first told my parents about it they thought i was going into the landscaping business” says ramaswamyhe scored an interview with dan gold who runs  billion qvt financial in new york “he was bright but also hungry” recalls gold they wound up talking for several hours discussing ramaswamy’s senior thesis on the ethical issues involved with using stem cells to create humananimal hybrids he became an analyst with his biology training ramaswamy understood early the potential of drugs to treat hepatitis c a bloodborne liver virus that afflicts at least  million americans—and his resulting trades for qvt amazed wall street in  ramaswamy started buying shares of pharmasset in princeton new jersey at about  on a splitadjusted basis and was one of the top shareholders when gilead bought the company for  a share or  billion in  rama swamy repeated the performance with inhibitex which was purchased by bristolmyers squibb for  billion in  making fold qvt’s initial investment at  ramaswamy was made a qvt partneron the side—“for the intellectual experience”—he earned a law degree from yale he was “one of the few people who did all the reading” says yale law professor david grewal “he always came to class ready to argue—he likes arguing”such critical thinking resulted in an epiphany ramaswamy noticed there were many many forgotten drugs that he would have liked to invest in but couldn’t they were trapped in big pharmaceutical firms that had shelved them for strategic or bureaucratic reasons or in small biotechnology firms that had to focus all their resources on a single product speaking at a down syndrome fundraiser in north carolina he laid out the moral case “there is probably a promising drug candidate that has already been discovered for the treatment of down syndrome that is sitting on the shelf of some drug company”when ramaswamy struck out on his own last may qvt and dexcel  pharma an israeli firm that had no ticed his track record backed him to the tune of nearly  million he named his company roivant—he’s fond of the acronym “roi”—and set out to deliver high returns on investment from a relatively shabby rentanoffice building for startups in midtown manhattan his small disparate crew including some young ivy league graduates and two biotech heavyweights—larry friedhoff  the former head of rd at eisai and andrx and william symonds  who had been instrumental in the success of pharmasset and gilead—occupied a disjointed space where they couldn’t even sit together no matter “to be honest if i was going to bet on a human to win at something” says symonds “i would bet on vivek”the pharmasset connection served them well that company thrived because of a single hep c pill called sofosbuvir or sovaldi which after being purchased by gilead had the best launch of any medicine ever generating  billion in its first year the drug was rumoured to be named after mike sofia the chemist who invented it now sofia had started a new company oncore biopharma to fight a different kind of hepatitis hep b thanks to vaccination it’s less of a problem in the us but it kills  people a year largely in asia and subsaharan africa by causing liver complications like cancer as with hepatitis c and hiv treating hep b would require multiple drugs in combination yet promising candidates were spread across the pharma universe another market failure so ramaswamy took control of oncore and executed three more deals to bring four other forgotten drugs into the pipeline he took the faster route to going public by merging oncore into tekmira a nasdaqlisted company developing more antiviral drugs and renaming it arbutus in the course of seven months ramaswamy had turned an initial  million investment into  million of market valuewith this instant success ramaswamy was poised to think bigger everyone knows that alzheimer’s is a scourge—it’s forecast to afflict  million americans and cost the us economy  trillion annually by  but it’s also a pharma death trap between  and  researchers tested  alzheimer’s drugs and only one made it to market—a  percent failure rateramaswamy’s research chief friedhoff had led the development of aricept the bestselling alzheim er’s drug ever with  billion in peak sales when his young boss told him he was interested in the castoff glaxo drug friedhoff told him to find something less risky than alzheimer’s but ramaswamy kept hearing that the drug was worth a look “when people have asked me over the years ‘are there any drugs that should have gone forward that should get another chance’ this one comes to mind” says rachelle doody a top alzheimer’s researcher at the baylor college of medicine who worked with the drug when it was glaxo’ssymonds set up a meeting with atul pande glaxo’s senior vice president in charge of neuroscience research they found pande was effusive about the drug so much so that he would eventually leave to become an axovant director which had been a victim of glaxo’s technical retreat from neuroscience in  glaxo had announced that it was mostly going to exit the field and any lingering interest in alzheimer’s drugs would focus on reversing the disease instead of relieving symptomsbut when ramaswamy looked at the data for the drug he saw a winner it had failed the first three clinical trials that tested the drug alone but ramaswamy and many experts believe animal data that show rvt will work far better when paired with an older drug like aricept a fourth study offered evidence of that but the trial failed because glaxo picked the wrong endpoint in the fourth study rvt reversed alzheimer’s patients’ symptoms to where they had been more than six months before but then the disease’s merciless progression continued still if the next trial can show the same benefit—or even a slightly weaker one—that would be enough to get the medicine approved more comfort another drug being developed by the danish drug firm lundbeck targets the same brain receptor as rvt and shows similar results friedhoff roivant’s renowned alzheimer’s expert was convincednow the only problem was getting the drug out of glaxo eventually ramaswamy got the terms he wanted just  million upfront but also  million in milestones and a  percent royalty on sales basically he gives big companies a chance to win big—if rvt ever becomes a  billion seller the royalties would boost glaxo’s earnings by  percent with the drug in hand ramaswamy decided to spin out axovant—the company built around rvt as its only asset—hitting up his old hedge fund peers “he comes from our world” says peter kolchinsky who runs  billion ra capital “i saw the data and i knew that if i didn’t say yes it was going to go to someone else” kolchinsky’s condition he wanted a big position he bought  million worth his fund’s largest holding at the ipo price so did hedge fund visium asset management mutual fund managers like capital growth and janus also bought in in order to signal to investors that the hedge funds would not take advantage of a firstday pop the funds agreed to hold their shares for at least  days—a costly move since axovant shot up nearly  percent after its ipo in june but then fell below its offering price “the markets can fluctuate but the fundamentals haven’t changed” says kolchinsky a decade ago raising  million in a biotech offering was unheard of today it’s commonplace in january venture capitalists put  million into moderna therapeutics a company with fascinating science but no drugs in testing and a few months later they gave  million to denali therapeutics another company focussed on alzheimer’s as well as parkinson’s the public markets are also bubbling in july nantkwest the latest company from biotech billionaire patrick soonshiong raised  million at a  billion valuation based on its new cancerkilling cellsamid this rush of money ramaswamy’s big alzheimer’s ipo spooked investors after all for ramaswamy’s team axovant is a nolose investment given the minuscule price it paid glaxo for rvt but public investors understandably fear being set up as greater fools this doesn’t bode well for the young dealmaker’s grand scheme says ramaswamy “it’s ironic because it will be the same capitalefficient approach that brought rvt that will be our model for building our business going forward” axovant speculators will have to wait until  before they hear of any new rvt data for alzheimer’s under the best possible scenario real benefit to alzheimer’s patients is years way clinical trials are notoriously difficult even when the remedy seems to work—and expensive it may ultimately take  million to run the trial on rvtbut it would be a mistake to get stuck in the weeds of roivant’s alzheimer’s efforts ramaswamy’s approach is long term and broad in scope in many ways he is taking a page from the career of michael pearson the billionaire chief executive of valeant pharmaceuticals in the early s when drug approvals were approaching an alltime low pearson came up with a financial engineering strategy that produced a company now worth  billion using a tax shelter to buy drugs that were underperforming and cutting costs including rd to the bone it’s a successful approach that has won wall street approval most notably from bill ackman whose pershing square hedge fund owns  percent of valeant ramaswamy is doing something similar except he’s betting that biotech is so productive at inventing new remedies that he can find forgotten drugs for cheap and fund more rd not less “it’s a specialty biotech that will create value out of products that are yet to reach the market rather than extracting value out of dwindling revenue streams” he says ramaswamy has something pearson lacks charisma “i tend to like people who are a little bold and get things done but do it in a way that isn’t obnoxious” says brent saunders the chief executive of allergan “i think vivek fits the bill so far”like pearson ramaswamy has an innovative strategy for growth even if rvt fails axovant has used it to raise nearly  million it can spend on other compounds meanwhile ramaswamy’s roivant vehicle still sitting on nearly  million will be buying other drugs which he can spin off or house in silos letting him tailor and incentivise specialised teams around each effort this approach will allow him to spread his bets in fundoffund fashion as well as give potential investors pureplay action in an array of therapeutic areas ramaswamy’s youthful enthusiasm and hubris haven’t gone unnoticed but however the drugs perform there’s real financial innovation here with potential to save and improve countless lives whether through him or others who emulate the model and that’s something a biotech bubble whenever it bursts can’t wash away this story appears in the  october  issue of forbes india you can buy our tablet

science translational medicine by derek lowe vivek ramaswamy’s plans by derek lowejanuary   i last wrote about vivek ramaswamy in the context of his first company axovant that one went public on the hopes for a retread alzheimer’s drug to work out in phase iii and if that sounds a little iffy to you then join a fairly large club alzheimer’s is truly the approachavoidance conflict writ large from one perspective you have a massive everexpanding patient population in wealthy industrialized countries almost totally unserved by existing therapies and willing to pay handsomely for something that really works from the other perspective you have a slowmoving disease that’s very difficult to diagnose well in a heterogeneous patient population that tends to show several comorbidities giving you a corresponding need for large trial enrollments but with no good animal models to guide you to the clinic and a clinical success rate that’s basically  it’s a highvoltage standoff you would never know to read a lot of ramaswamy’s press coverage here’s a recent profile from techcrunch that the axovant drug works through a mechanism that has failed twice in alzheimer’s clinical trials so far it has an extremely low chance of working this time too – if there’s some convincing reason why this latest attempt should succeed where the others have failed i haven’t heard it so the riskreward behind axovant’s ipo makes no sense to me at all but that hasn’t slowed the man down his company myovant had a big ol’ ipo back in the fall built on a former takeda candidate for uterine fibroids here’s the latest addition according to that profile piece ramaswamy is building a whole portfolio of companies based on compounds like this the idea explains ramaswamy is to create individual companies around each drug or small groupings of candidates that roivant acquires then install the scientists who developed the drugs and provide them with big rewards if the drugs prove useful if the drugs don’t pan out roivant will  find another place for the scientists — potentially at another company under its umbrella fine i like not firing people you wouldn’t know from such articles though that there have been and are other companies which have been formed around the idea of taking pharma castoffs and getting them through the clinic larger companies already try to monetize what they can in their portfolio by partnering or outlicensing of course the medicines company is one such dealmaker acquiring and partnering latestage compounds and trying to get them approved outside of the forprofit business model there are a number of initiatives trying to repurpose or revive older compounds for new diseasesno one so far has been able to take over the world doing this there are not unfortunately many big piles of such candidates sitting around most of the shelved compounds were shelved because a they did not work andor b they showed toxicity you’re going to have to figure a way around those problems before you go back into humans and that’s not easy there are a few drugs that have been dropped for business reasons or were lost or mishandled during a merger or the like but i don’t think that there are enough of those to make a ramaswamy drug empire from that same profile i found this to be a bit oddsounding whether the scheme will work longer term isn’t clear but it’s easy to appreciate why people like seely and shih were drawn to ramaswamy’s vision at traditional topdown pharmaceutical companies scientists aren’t typically rewarded when a drug they’ve developed becomes a blockbuster and failed drugs often translate into job cuts “it sounds vanilla but i can’t overstate the importance of realigning rd personnel” says ramaswamy of his decentralized approach “a lot of what you see in conventional pharma rd is because scientists’ jobs are on the line if their projects fail in many instances clinical studies aren’t designed to get the answer but instead not get the answer there’s a kickthecan mentality” by addressing that incentive misalignment he insists “we’ve stacked the odds in our favor” ok let’s take these one by one i have seen nothing about just how these new companies are going to reward people if the drug makes it to market i will also note that people do actually have incentives at other drug companies to get things to market – it sounds stupid to have to say this but that second paragraph seems to make it necessary i have no idea what ramaswamy is talking about when he says that clinical trials are designed to “not get the answer” and i would welcome some clarification the only kickthecan stuff i see is done by small companies that are trolling for some kind of deal or partnership and they’re taking a very large risk when they do things that way otherwise there’s simply no point for a company to run a clinical trial that is not directly aimed at their business interests to paraphrase samuel johnson no one but a blockhead ever went into the clinic except for money it’s damned expensive and you want to get the best answer you can get in the shortest time it takes to get it so i don’t see the misaligned incentives that ramaswamy does and how this stacks the odds in his favor is another question the proteins cells and organs that are being targeted in the patients are impervious to bold statements and applause in the press they don’t care what your business model is or how your ipo went they will do what they do and what they do most of the time unfortunately is not what we want them to in alzheimer’s they let us down pretty near every time i don’t see anything that vivek ramaswamy is doing that will change that  comments on “vivek ramaswamy’s plans” dionysius rex says january   at  am i think a lot of phase  trials especially in cancer are so underpowered that ramaswamy is partly correct in saying “not get the answer”…for many companies the “wrong” answer is a death knell whereas anything even remotely better than placebostandard of care even if statistically insignificant means progression to phase  reply derek lowe says january   at  am those are the examples i was thinking of and they’re real but larger companies of the sort that he’s doing deals with shouldn’t be running stuff like this reply biotechtoreador says january   at  am my guess is vivek is taking a similar approach to rewarding his rd staff to that taken by martin shkreli that is giving them a share of royalties should drug x be approved i beleive this was discussed in this forum a few years ago there are clear limits to this approach in that there’s only so much royalty to give away which will create some asymmetrical motivations even in the rd staff i understand that rd staff are incented sic to produce drugs in most companies but not to the same degree employees at hedge funds vivek’s background are rewarded for success as you point out financially motivating scientists likely affects biological reality very little and i plan to be short axon prior to the p readout one could argue that lly’s hardly a small company recent adventure into phase  with solan was a kick the can exercise—it wasn’t designed to fail as most silly open label uncontrolled p studies little companies do are—but it was certainly proposed by some rd leader hoping to keep hisher job a while longer reply bhip says january   at  am yup strongly agree the statement “the only kickthecan stuff i see is done by small companies that are trolling for some kind of deal or partnership” misses many instances of can kicking in big pharma p tace yet another sip agonist or bamyloid ab in which the known sideeffects or market position will ensure failure reply rm says january   at  am it’s also important to separate conscious kickthecan from unconscious kickthecan people can get pretty attached to programs especially if their jobs are on the line for failure and can be quite adept at softpedaling and selfdelusion reply m says january   at  am i don’t think “trials with a low chance of success” is the same as “designed not to get the answer” in the ramaswamy quote for one thing his structure wouldn’t correct those incentives at all–if you get even more rewards when “your” compound makes it you’re certainly going to find new variations on every measurement to see if you can get something out there reply derek lowe says january   at  pm a very good point and exactly what i would expect to see happen as well reply mtk says january   at  am i’m not sure i’m understanding things properly here by kicking the can i take that to mean that a clinical trial is often designed not to provide a definitive answer but simply to get enough info to progress to the next clinical trial even with that however candidates often fail in short they can’t even clear that lower barrier so now ramaswamy believes that by getting to the answer they’ll be able to rescue these drugs that failed to get through a lower hurdle that honestly doesn’t sound logical or am i missing something here is his model is to fail faster nothing new there and have the rd folks move on to the next thing but isn’t that the same as what everyone is trying to do and by incentivizing people even more for the success of a project means that you’re incentivizing against fail faster right someone set me straight reply anon says january   at  am there’s no kickthecan stuff at az merck or pfizer really when i was working at a big pharma i saw this all the time add to this he is right i don’t think pharma incentivizes enough for success if you don’t believe me look at the difference between annual bonuses and annual saleries for scientists vs say executives let’s put it this way where would you rather discover a blockbuster drug a big pharma or a small startup reply hap says january   at  am the chances are higher that i’ll keep my job if i help find a blockbuster in big pharma – if i find one in a small pharma chances are i’ll get cashiered to fund the next set of trials getting enough equity to get a decent payout from the success is not also terribly certain given the amount of data that you can afford to collect or the incentives of management is your chance of finding a blockbuster higher at a small pharma than a big pharma it depends what you want and your level of risk tolerance but payout from a blockbuster seems like a poor reason to choose a startup reply anon says january   at  pm  hap “chances are better i will keep my job in big pharma” unfortunately this statement isn’t in keeping with my personal experience i know personally four people who have either discovered drugs or clinical candidates three are no longer at their respective companies with  of those being involuntary let’s be real at the end of the day it’s all about who can brown nose the best with the decision makers generally lab rats who make tons of compounds don’t do that well in that regard as for working at start ups the only reason i see is being a larger part of the process that’s part a monetary thing and part how much control you get over your ideas reply magrinho says january   at  am axovant is drug discovery theatre with the sole aim of enriching the principals on a related topic – “how to appropriately provide incentives for success in a matrix organization” would be a long thread we’d all agree but how to implement a my  proudest lifetime achievements were preclinical efforts that died at various stages in development due to no shortcomingsno input from my team b a project i was involved with for  months went to p i got my name on the patents etc but i can’t honestly say my fingerprints were on the drug who should get the bigger reward a or b in other words who should be valued more highly by the organization reply biotechtoreador says january   at  pm “who should get the bigger reward a or b in other words who should be valued more highly by the organization” that’s a fair question to which i don’t know there’s a fair answer b will be valued more highly by the investors who make the whole thing possible reply chrispy says january   at  pm i’ve definitely seen kickthecan exercises at both big pharma and academia in big pharma jobs and bonuses are often tied to “progressing” a drug regardless of what the biology is telling you but that said i’ve never seen a clinical trial at a big company designed to fall short of significance i agree that small companies often run “safety” studies that are really underpowered efficacy studies designed to sell the company in academia people get awfully attached to the hypothesis that got them their initial grants so there is a perverse disincentive to believe truth even when it smacks you in the face lookin’ at you peter duesberg… as for running with big pharma’s castoffs one of the best examples might be speedel pushing forward with aliskiren from novartis but that was a little murky with novartis investing in speedel and then purchasing the company later on so it may have just been a way to shield the larger company from the serious safety issues the drug hadhas i actually have no idea — this is just conjecture anyone know reply biotech scientist says january   at  pm when i read this yesterday i immediately thought of theranos not the same exact situation but hype sure smells like it it isn’t as “groundbreaking” but it is close after all the press releases i have seen in my time there is a time to say ‘yes’ to having pieces written about you and my internal clock says at least  success reply dr np says january   at  pm cubist acquired cubicin from eli lilly…it was shelved…it went on to sell more than  million dollar per year…many phase  trials are lame duck designed to move to phase …these phase  trials are many time done in geographies where data manipulation is relatively easy…last time i checked pharma scientists are no way getting incentives like google employees… reward does magic…increases efficiency and priorities like nothing else…you getting wrong derek… success rate in az…ya that’s what we had before aeroplane started flyingdon’t be so pessimistic… reply another guy named dan says january   at  pm sounds like another application for hollywood accounting set up an llc or limited partnership for each drug have parent pharma “lend” it the money to conduct trials and pass out a few shares in the specialpurpose vehicle to the researchers of course if the drug does hit all of the profits get eaten up in “fees” and interest owed by the spv to the parent so everybody gets rich while the drug remains unprofitable on an accounting basis reply anon says january   at  pm a bit off topic but i don’t understand how investors go for this business model he can only run an effective clinical trial if they raise money through an ipo the stock price is only going to increase upon successful clinical news which is years away it will go down as founders cash out – axovant down  as an investor why not buy x the stock for the same price a year after the ipo however if everyone did this there would be no ipo and thus no clinical trial therefore the initial investors fund the clinical trial but minimize their potential gains i am not an investor though so i must be missing something reply barry says january   at  pm daptomycin cubicin is one example of a drug that a small company brought profitably to market when a big company shelved it gleevec had been shelved when ciba abandoned pdgfr as a cancer target but proved to be a billionyr property when pazdurfda compelled themnovartis to develop it for cml but i don’t see a lot more such examples on the shelf more likely many drugs that could be very efficacious against precancerous states have failed in clinical trials against advanced cancers that had acquired many mutations some of these could be lifesaving and profitable but will only move forward ifwhen our fda recognizes these precancerous states as ‘diseases’ reply zero says january   at  am interesting an example cervical dysplasia is a precancerous state and often treated as a disease up to and including surgical excision are other precancerous states not handled the same way that seems very foolish… reply anon says january   at  pm pharma’s drug development scrap heap is just bulging with gold nuggets that have been wrongly thrown out by useless incompetent scientists and are just waiting to be recycled by vivek the drug prophet yeah right more like he knows how to polish a turd and sell crap to naive investors before the polish wears off well we saw what happened with valeant – the protagonist makes billions and the investors lose their shirt while the patients gain nothing this model has nothing to do with real drug development reply johnnyboy says january   at  am ramaswamy theranos’ holmes moderna’s bancel – the key to get investment these days is to master silicon valleyspeak and get chummy with their vcs the science is secondary at best reply vivek says january   at  am science reply kling says january   at  am desperate times results in simple minded people flocking to the eloquent the current pharma climate has detached scientific reason from business decisions science and bd are drifting apart when has a pharma executive led bd deal ever been shot down during scientific due diligence i have not seen it at my pharma maybe i am blind reply mtk says january   at  am i actually think that there are good compounds out there that have been for a variety of reasons been tossed aside by pharma and that can be shepherded to becoming a drug however imo it’s not for the reasons that ramaswamy states and there lies the problem with the business model if you’ve misdiagnosed you’re going to mistreat reply me says january   at  pm plus there’s the other fact you’re all missing the ad trials are set up to fail because they don’t target peroxynitrites… reply anon says january   at  am do you think peroxynitrites are really involved in ad i though ab and tau were to blame and ab is produced by secretases not peroxynitrite reply anon says january   at  pm while incentives are nice pay usually comes down to market forces for those of you on the clinical side you will see medical doctors make a ton of money but not really contribute very much of anything beyond adding their credential to a protocol they mostly regurgitate what they can from msls then the present clinical data to basic scientists and basic science data to clinical folks so to each party this md is looked up to as someone who is filling a knowledge gap the best incentives for early development folks would be a priority class of stock optionsshares however the vcs usually prevent that from happening reply leo says february   at  pm the real forgotten drugs are compounds that can’t be patented or where patents expired they might be very useful for treating diseases different from what they were originally used for but no one has any interest of funding clinical trials for these as there is no money to be made reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are
