purchaseabout uscontact us long short advisors﻿ long short advisors llc is a mutual fund company based in philadelphia that focuses on undiscovered alternative investments and boutique hedge fund investment strategies  our liquid alternative mutual fund products provide the advantages of daily liquidity low initial investment minimums more portfolio transparency lower fees and access to what we believe are some of the best hedge fund managers and investment managers in the business we launched our first fund in  a longshort equity mutual fundlong short advisors is committed to bringing boutique institutional investment strategies once only accessible to institutions and ultrahigh net worth clients  we believe in strong alignment of interests with our partners  our sub advisors have significant personal investments in the strategies they manage on behalf of fund investorsphilosophy  disciplinewe are looking for managers that do not follow the herd mentality and try to provide a unique edge and alpha to their strategies  we believe unique investment managers are defined by several distinguishing traitsthe manager has successfully implemented an investment strategy over at least one full market cycle  there are periods between cycles when managers can generate high returns and low volatility by either explicitly or indirectly latching onto a specific high performing factor exposure  it is not until the end of a market cycle after the prior excesses have been unwound when we can then sufficiently evaluate the true sources of performance the sustainability of the investment strategy and the manager’s attitude towards risk managementwe strongly prefer small and medium sized investment management firms as subadvisors for our funds  we believe there is an inflection point in the lifecycle of an investment firm where the distractions associated with managing a growing business become an impediment to investment performance  our subadvisors eat their own cooking and have great passion for the investment process  they hire world class middle and backoffice professionals to minimize the time they spend away from managing the portfolioas a corollary to our feelings on business structure we partner with investment professionals who have clearly defined the capacity constraints associated with their strategies we know that in most cases a portfolio manager’s ability to implement the strategy upon which the firm’s successful track record has been built is directly compromised at specific aum thresholds  our subadvisors will not compromise performance in pursuit of value destroying objectiveswe require strong alignment of interests between our subadvisors and investors in our mutual fund products  our subadvisors have significant investments in the strategies they manage on behalf of fund investors  they also have a strong focus on our strategies with limited external business diversionswe believe our subadvisors possess skills attributes and proficiencies that provide a clear competitive advantage distinguishing their strategies as unique  we have collectively evaluated thousands of managers including who we believe are some of the best and brightest from a broad array of strategies  this provides a high baseline standard against which we can efficiently identify core competencies that we believe are truly
