end from maryland they also upgraded their offensive backfield trading underachieving running back kevan barlow to the jets making frank gore the feature back smith also spent the offseason working daily with his new coordinator wide receivers and tight end while working to improve his technique and add bulk the improved offensive cast clearly helped smith develop in his second year especially

their division rivals during the broadcast on nfl network cris collinsworth noted that if he were starting an nfl franchise he would have taken the broncos rookie quarterback jay cutler before alex smith and fellow rookies matt leinart and vince young – and that smith was not even close to the others going into the th quarter the ers were trailing the seahawks – and pulling out a win looked unlikely smith however performed brilliantly in the fourth quarter and drove the ers on a long touchdown drive down the field early taking a narrow – lead late in the quarter with the same score smith struck again – shaking off an almost certain sack rolling to the left and completing a pass to frank gore for a touchdown to give the ers a point lead on the next drive smith cemented the victory by

completed under  of his passes far below the league average of  smith was at odds with ers head coach mike nolan over the severity of his injury nolan publicly inferred that smith was not fighting through the injury while smith felt that the injury still affected his ability to throw accurately an account that was supported by players from the seahawks nolan decided to rest smith following a loss in that game to the seahawks on november  and start trent dilfer to allow smiths shoulder to recover following the decision orthopedic surgeon james andrews said that upon further examination the shoulder did not heal as significantly as andrews thought it would and on december   smith was placed on injured reserve to undergo surgery on the shoulder ending his season  seasonedit smith entered

offensive coordinatorhead coach mike martz unlike the previous three seasons where offensive continuity was somewhat maintained martzs system was completely different smith lost the starting job in

variation of the spread offense that he ran in college the ers continued to build their team having now drafted anthony davis and mike iupati with their two first round picks to provide more protection on september  coach singletary announced that smith was named one of the teams captains in week  smith was booed at home and the crowd chanted for his backup david carr before leading the

in total passing yardage for  including yardage lost from sacks and smith was often cynically referred to as a game manager in this manner the new york times wrote that smith was a steady if unspectacular player surrounded by a solid team in  whose career year underscored how much he struggled previously it was his first season with over  yards passing and he set personal singleseason

written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by
