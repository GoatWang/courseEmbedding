massproduced semiconductor device in the s one of the us space programs goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth in  nasa began manned apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in july  the apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing testing and producing its electronics the division of motorola which would eventually become freescale semiconductor supplied thousands of semiconductor devices groundbased tracking and checkout equipment and  onboard tracking and communications units an updata link in the apollos command module received signals from earth to relay to other onboard systems a transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data also that yearclarification needed motorolas technologies were used to introduce the first twoway mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years providing the tools behind the radio transponder and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in  the companys first

of the first semiconductor companies in the world having started as a division of motorola in phoenix arizona in  and then becoming autonomous by the divestiture of the semiconductor products sector of motorola in  in  a motorola transistor for car radios was the worlds first commercial highpower transistor it was also motorolas first massproduced semiconductor device in the s one of the us space programs goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth in  nasa began manned apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in july  the apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing testing and producing its electronics the division of motorola which would eventually become freescale semiconductor supplied thousands of semiconductor devices groundbased tracking and checkout equipment and  onboard tracking and communications units an updata link in the apollos command module received signals from earth to relay to other onboard systems a transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data also that yearclarification needed motorolas technologies were used to introduce the first twoway mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years providing the tools behind the radio transponder and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in  the companys first microprocessor mc bit was introduced in  and was used in automotive computing and video game applications motorolas next generation bit microprocessor the mc led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in  powering devices from companies such as apple commodore atari sega sun and hewlettpackard in the s motorolas technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for antilock brake systems one of the first microelectromechanical systems mems inertial sensor for automotive airbags and motorolas mpc microprocessor deployed telematic systems for general motors onstar systems since then freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer medical networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the worlds first tubingfree wireless insulin pump to and automotive microcontrollers for

the divestiture of the semiconductor products sector of motorola in  in  a motorola transistor for car radios was the worlds first commercial highpower transistor it was also motorolas first massproduced semiconductor device in the s one of the us space programs goals was to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth in  nasa began manned apollo flights that led to the first lunar landing in july  the apollo program was particularly significant for hundreds of employees involved in designing testing and producing its electronics the division of motorola which would eventually become freescale semiconductor supplied thousands of semiconductor devices groundbased tracking and checkout equipment and  onboard tracking and communications units an updata link in the apollos command module received signals from earth to relay to other onboard systems a transponder received and transmitted voice and television signals and scientific data also that yearclarification needed motorolas technologies were used to introduce the first twoway mobile radio with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars motorola has continued its growth in the networking and communications sector in later years providing the tools behind the radio transponder and going on to develop the first prototype of the first analog mobile phone in  the companys first microprocessor mc bit was introduced in  and was used in automotive computing and video game applications motorolas next generation bit microprocessor the mc led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in  powering devices from companies such as apple commodore atari sega sun and hewlettpackard in the s motorolas technology was the driving force behind intelligent power switches for antilock brake systems one of the first microelectromechanical systems mems inertial sensor for automotive airbags and motorolas mpc microprocessor deployed telematic systems for general motors onstar systems since then freescale continued to provide the technology behind consumer medical networking and automotive products from microprocessors for the worlds first tubingfree wireless
