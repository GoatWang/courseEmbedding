film is indicated for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support under the drug addiction treatment act data codified at  usc g prescription use of this product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to physicians who meet certain qualifying requirements and who have notified the secretary of health and human services hhs of their intent to prescribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique identification number that must be included on every prescription  dosage and administration  important dosage and administration information bunavail buccal film is applied to the buccal mucosa as a single daily dose bunavail buccal film should be used in patients who have been initially inducted using buprenorphine sublingual tablets the difference in bioavailability of bunavail compared to suboxone sublingual tablet requires a different dosage strength to be administered to the patient a bunavail  mg buccal film provides equivalent buprenorphine exposure to a suboxone  mg sublingual tablet medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient followup visits  maintenance bunavail buccal film is indicated for maintenance treatment the recommended target dosage of bunavail buccal film is  mg per day as a single daily dose the dosage of bunavail buccal film should be progressively adjusted in incrementsdecrements of  mg buprenorphinenaloxone to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms the maintenance dose of bunavail buccal film is generally in the range of  mg buprenorphinenaloxone to  mg buprenorphinenaloxone per day depending on the individual patient dosages higher than this have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage when determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration consider the patient’s level of stability the security of his or her home situation and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of takehome medication  method of administration the patient should use the tongue to wet the inside of the cheek or rinse the mouth with water to moisten the area immediately before placement of bunavail open the bunavail package immediately prior to use as indicated by the instructions hold the bunavail film with clean dry fingers with the text bn bn or bn facing up place the side of the bunavail film with the text bn bn or bn against the inside of the cheek press and hold the film in place for  seconds bunavail films adheres to the moist buccal mucosa and should stay in place after this period if multiple films need to be administered the patient should immediately apply the next film according to the steps above note that when two films are required for one dose the patient should place one film on the inside of one cheek and the other film on the inside of the other cheek for doses requiring multiple films no more than two films should be applied to the inside of one cheek at a time bunavail films completely dissolves after application the patient should be instructed to avoid manipulating the films with the tongue or fingers and avoid drinking or eating food until the films dissolves bunavail film should not be chewed or swallowed as this may result in lower peak concentrations and lower bioavailability see clinical pharmacology  instruct the patient to use the entire film bunavail should not be cut or torn proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient  clinical supervision treatment should be initiated with supervised administration progressing to unsupervised administration as the patient’s clinical stability permits bunavail buccal film is subject to diversion and abuse when determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration consider the patient’s level of stability the security of his or her home situation and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of takehome medication ideally patients should be seen at reasonable intervals eg at least weekly during the first month of treatment based upon the individual circumstances of the patient medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient followup visits periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen effectiveness of the treatment plan and overall patient progress once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment eg urine drug screening does not indicate illicit drug use less frequent followup visits may be appropriate a oncemonthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the physician’s evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as absence of medication toxicity absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects responsible handling of medications by the patient patient’s compliance with all elements of the treatment plan including recoveryoriented activities psychotherapy andor other psychosocial modalities abstinence from illicit drug use including problematic alcohol andor benzodiazepine use if treatment goals are not being achieved the physician should reevaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment  patients with hepatic impairment severe hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine and moderate hepatic impairment also results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a greater extent than buprenorphine because the doses of this fixed combination product cannot be individually titrated the combination product should generally be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment see warnings and precautions   unstable patients physicians will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients for example some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the physician does not feel that heshe has the expertise to manage the patient in such cases the physician may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment patients who continue to misuse abuse or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with or referred to more intensive and structured treatment  stopping treatment the decision to discontinue therapy with bunavail buccal film after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan taper patients to avoid opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms  switching between bunavailbuccal film and other buprenorphinenaloxone combination products for patients being switched between zubsolv sublingual tablets and other buprenorphinenaloxone products dosage adjustments may be necessary patients should be monitored for overmedication as well as withdrawal or other signs of underdosing the difference in bioavailability of bunavail compared to suboxone sublingual tablet requires a different dosage strength to be administered to the patient a bunavail  mg buccal film provides equivalent buprenorphine exposure to a suboxone  mg sublingual tablet patients being switched between suboxone dosage strengths and bunavail dosage strengths should be started on the

abuse potential buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids legal or illicit prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse abuse or diversion and ensure appropriate protection from theft including in the home clinical monitoring appropriate to the patient’s level of stability is essential multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient followup visits see drug abuse and dependence   respiratory depression buprenorphine particularly when taken by the iv route in combination with benzodiazepines or other cns depressants including alcohol has been associated with significant respiratory depression and death many but not all postmarketing reports regarding coma and death associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines involved misuse by selfinjection deaths have also been reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine with other depressants such as alcohol or other cns depressant drugs patients should be warned of the potential danger of selfadministration of benzodiazepines or other depressants while under treatment with bunavail buccal film see drug interactions   i n the case of overdose the primary management should be the reestablishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration if required naloxone may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary bunavail buccal film should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function eg chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cor pulmonale decreased respiratory reserve hypoxia hypercapnia or preexisting respiratory depression  cns depression patients receiving buprenorphine in the presence of opioid analgesics general anesthetics benzodiazepines phenothiazines other tranquilizers sedativehypnotics or other cns depressants including alcohol may exhibit increased cns depression consider dose reduction of cns depressants bunavail buccal film or both in situations of concomitant prescribing see drug interactions    unintentional pediatric exposure buprenorphine can cause severe possibly fatal respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it store buprenorphinecontaining medications safely out of the sight and reach of children and destroy any unused medication appropriately see patient counseling information    neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome ​ neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome nows is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy whether that use is medicallyauthorized or illicit unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults nows may be lifethreatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of nows and manage accordingly see specific populations   advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with bunavail of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available see use in specific populations  this risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes therefore prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy  adrenal insufficiency cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use more often following greater than one month of use presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include nonspecific symptoms and signs including nausea vomiting anorexia fatigue weakness dizziness and low blood pressure if adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency the information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency  dependence ​ buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the muopioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper the withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids this should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse abuse or diversion see drug abuse and dependence   hepatitis hepatic events cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through postmarketing adverse event reports the spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death hepatic failure hepatic necrosis hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy in many cases the presence of preexisting liver enzyme abnormalities infection with hepatitis b or hepatitis c virus concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role in other cases insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases however in other cases no dose reduction was necessary the possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases liver function tests prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended a biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected depending on the case bunavail buccal film may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated  allergic reactions cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and naloxone containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the postmarketing experience cases of bronchospasm angioneurotic edema and anaphylactic shock have been reported the most common signs and symptoms include rashes hives and pruritus a history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of bunavail buccal film  precipitation of opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms because it contains naloxone bunavail buccal film is likely to produce withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin morphine or methadone because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine bunavail buccal film may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered bucally before the
