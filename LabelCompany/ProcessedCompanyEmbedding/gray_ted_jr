was    good friends and early mentors served west texas cowman ted gray well over the years he took their counsel and examples to heart and the onetime dollaraday cowboy gradually put together a large ranching land and oil business ted gray was managing large outfit by the time he was  by colleen schreiber alpine  ted gray came west with a truckload of mules it was  and he was only 6 years old it was his mentor jerome dees who got gray interested in west texas and ranching dees had worked on many of the large cow outfits in west texas like the westpyle cattle co and the figure s gray had listened to dees stories about west texas and how there was opportunity in that big country for anyone who was willing to work hard fl shawver was another mentor both he and dees were ranchers in jack county and dees had a ranch in llano county as well those two men guided gray in his early years from them gray says he learned thrift he also received much encouragement mr dees told me that everyone was responsible for oneself and that i should try and work to better myself so that i would have something later in life gray born in jacksboro in  was the th child in a family of  je gray sr was a stock farmer as were so many of that era gray remembers well the hard times brought on by the great depression his father essentially went broke during that time gray himself was drawing a paycheck at the tender age of  he also trapped coons and sold the hides he worked hard to get what he wanted when he had enough money saved up he bought two pigs he raised many litters of pigs and when a trader came through with a truckload of ponies he sold his pigs and bought his first horse i was a born cowboy gray says i didnt like farming thats another reason why i wanted to get away when gray was  he sold his two cows and calves for  a pair and his horse for  and headed to colorado he had heard about the  ranch outside of greeley and hoped to hire on there he did at  a day it was the most money hed ever seen gray stayed in colorado through the summer and then came back to jack county but not for long dees stories of west texas kept coming back to him when he heard about a mule trader who was hauling a load of mules to alpine he grabbed his saddle and bedroll and jumped on board when he left for west texas he left his life in north texas behind forever he took with him his work ethic and his honesty he started out working on various ranches around alpine marfa and fort davis for  a month before he was  young gray had not only worked for many of the big outfits he had dreamed about but he had managed some of them as well grays longest stint was with the kokernot 6 ranch he worked there for  years and managed it for much of that time i can remember when we could drive down the street of alpine and pick up five or six cowboys who were eager to work you didnt ask what the pay was how long youd be gone or where you were going you were just glad to get on somewhere gray was a good allaround hand i expect i was a little better than a green hand he remarks i learned from doing it thats the way anyone learns when he was  he was offered a job managing nine points mesa ranch in south brewster county i was willing to work gray says perhaps i had the right diplomacy next he went to the bull weatherford ranch in south presidio county he worked at the s twice the s encompassed some  sections and ran  cattle the lykes brothers bought the ranch in the s though he enjoyed those experiences and learned from each of them gray thought the kokernot ranch was the place he wanted and needed to be he had heard good things about the ranch they were conservative in their ranching approach and they treated their men fairly he stayed with the 6 for a few years and learned a great deal but he desired more when he was  an opportunity arose with cap yates yates had been watching from afar and liked what he saw he knew the young man had potential and he needed some help on his operation so he offered gray half interest in his livestock and glass mountain ranch between alpine and marathon gray was young and had little capital he had made some friends however including some who were well connected he was able to borrow  from the bank in fort davis thanks in large part to one such friend joe espy he took me to the bank and told them to make me a note for what i needed gray recalls later mr espy made me a director in the bank i was just a kid i wouldnt have made it without friends like him gray knew it was a risky venture but he wanted to try so he left the 6 he worked hard but the timing was not the best when he went into the partnership the korean war and just begun when the war was over the bottom dropped out of the cattle market gray didnt see how he would ever be able to pay off his debt so he decided to get out before he was in too deep luckily the kokernots were needing a manager gray had worked hard for him before and kokernot believed in his ability so he offered gray the job gray accepted kokernot gave him free reign to run the operation as he saw fit he made many improvements in those early years he studied every phase of the ranching business forward and backward to be a good cowman takes lots of experience gray says you cant read it in a book you cant go to college and learn it the man who is most successful is the one who has made the most tracks on his operation when gray first arrived in west texas many ranches were still running two and three yearold steers the kokernot was no different hereford cattle were the norm in west texas and the kokernot followed that tradition gray however worked hard to raise the best my friend dees raised the best cattle i ever saw they fit the eye he says he knew cattle he was a cowman he bought bulls from dees for many years and he bought a good many from foy proctor as well find someone who raises cattle like you like gray recommends contract their bull calves every year and then eventually your cattle will begin to look the same the kokernot had seven camps each camp ran a thousand or so cows depending on the quality of the land and the acreage two or three men stayed at each camp when gray took over as manager he used a man a time or two on the works and if he proved to be a good hand the cowboy was hired as a steady the lower kokernot country was used for breeding and calving when the calves were cut off their mothers they drove them to the mountain country to grow out livestock did better in the mountain country gray says because the grass was much stronger steers weighed  to  pounds more compared to those run in the flats the wagon went out for the spring work about the first of april depending on the calf crop sometimes a little later in those days we had to get out ahead of the screwworms and generally anything that you branded or marked after the th of may would get worms gray explained the fall work generally began the first of october shipping took  to  days the lower end of the ranch was shipped out at hovey while the cattle in the mountains generally went to the southern pacific and santa fe pens at alpine it wasnt unusual to have  head in the pens there at one time gray says there werent many feedlots then certainly none in the panhandle so the cattle were shipped to the cornbelt or to los angeles many of the big steers went west california was a building population and they wanted red meat to feed their families gray says they didnt demand quality beef so the plainer cattle went west the train came out of presidio cattle had to be loaded out by midnight for the train to meet another one in san angelo that was going north if we fooled around it cost us another day of feed and water and rest between there and the cornbelt gray remembers we could ship three days a week if animals were going north or almost any day of the week going west on the southern pacific gray has shipped cattle as far north as minnesota a trip which took seven days most of the cattle went to indiana that trip took six days sometimes they would have to feed once and rest twice our cattle were healthy and they generally got there in good condition but it was expensive by train shipping by truck was a big advancement gray says we could get the cattle there in two days and a night he remembers one particular incident at the santa fe pens we would load one car and set the brake and it would roll off a ways and then lock gray explains this particular time whoever set the brake on the first car didnt set it too well we rolled that second car down and then i hear look yonder there go our cattle the two cars were on the main line rolling down the tracks i figured they would jump the track but the railroad engineer said they would roll clear to stockton fort stockton because its downhill all the way the engine was at the depot so the engineer got down there and got on the engine i thought it was the wabash cannonball he was rocking them rails trying to catch up the two cars were down about  miles before the engine caught up with them and hooked on the kokernots gray says were frugal operators they never spent much money they fed some but not often and never very much we had some awful good years gray recalls i can remember the first time calves brought  i cut everything that would dollar out we had a good bottom line figure most years  through the s was pretty slim but we never had a red figure he says we made a little money all the time the kokernot gray says was never known for having good horses i bought the first good stallion the ranch ever owned he was a yearling and i gave  for him and i thought i might get fired when i got home gray recalls by the time i left the kokernot for good they had a pretty good remuda gray had grown up doing things the old way and often it took him awhile to get used to a new way of doing business his first experience loading horses in a horse trailer was not a good one we didnt do much gasoline business gray remarks i moved my remuda with aday man gray says he wore out a lot of horses and a lot of ropes during the screwworm days particularly in  his first year at the kokernot it rained a lot that year and the worms were particularly bad when the hornflies got to bothering the cattle they would run into the catclaw for protection when the cattle got scratched up we had lots of worm problems gray closely followed what was being done to eradicate the screwworm he believed it would work but he knew raising the necessary funds would be a challenge he was appointed chairman for his county we raised a good bit of money in the tricounty area but i told dolph gov dolph briscoe that we wouldnt release the money until we got some flies gray said they were tracking the flies and they were moving  miles a day out of mexico when we got the first flies they were right away a tremendous help so we got busy raising more money while managing the 6 gray began buying calves and yearlings off neighboring ranches and others in the area it was a hard business to break into he says because he hadnt grown up in the area and few people knew anything about the young man he had never been one to talk about where he came from eventually however he established a reputation for being fair and honest and his trading business grew i burned the telephone up gray says i read every paper i could get my hands on and i stayed in touch with those who knew the markets thats how i knew how to price my cattle i talked to joe espy at least twice a week i suspect he knew every packer buyer in california as his capital increased so did his desire to run his own cattle again he approached herbert kokernot about the possibility and he generously agreed to let him run  to  cows on the ranch he bought  cows from john honeycutt of sierra blanca for  a pair when gray first came to west texas he says grass was stirrup high in a lot of the country it was some of the finest country hed ever seen the drouth of the s changed that image the 6 like many soon ran out of feed and almost out of water every year he sold off the oldest cows his own small herd was suffering as well he knew he couldnt afford to feed them and there was simply nothing left for them to eat so that left him with the only other option  sell he told kokernot of his plan mr kokernot told me that if i sold my cows as cheap as they were i would never be able to pay off my debt he told me i could carry my cattle anywhere on his ranch where there might be more grass i only had  cows he had  he was just that kind of man gray says thats how he made it through the drouth after the drouth broke gray began leasing country of his own first he leased the acre henderson ranch gray had handled their cattle for several years he signed a year lease and bought the cattle later he had an opportunity to buy the ranch in all he operated what he called the flat country for some years gray also leased the acre nevill ranch south of alpine he bought the cows with that ranch as well and operated it for  years he partnered with bruce pearson on the saddleback ranch a yearling operation and he leased the maupin country consisting of  acres near sierra blanca later after the kokernot split up he leased the limpia country for many years those were only a few of the leases he took on for a while gray and the kokernot family had all the country from balmorhea to alpine under their control the young man who had walked to school barefoot with ice on the ground had come a long way he had a dream and he worked to make that dream come true altogether it was sure turning the crank for an old cowboy gray admits it got to the point where a salary was something i sure didnt need i was paying more taxes a day than i was drawing in a month i always thought i was a republican he adds but sometimes when the democrats were in power i made more money really i think rainfall had more to do with the good years than anything else without grass you cant ranch ranching was not the only thing gray did well he made some wise trades in the land business worth evans also introduced him to the stock market and clayton williams taught him about the oil business ive always tried to associate myself with those who have been successful you dont want to follow an empty wagon he points out ranching however was his first love and remains so today i went through a lot of ups and downs in the cattle business but its what i really enjoyed gray has had nearly every bone in his body broken many more than once because being a good cowboy he says meant taking some risk horseback gray retired for good about  years ago he and his wife addie have been married for almost  years together theyve traveled the world but west texas has always been home the couple raised two sons ted jr and andy gray taught them everything he knew and both were fine hands he says but in the end after receiving a good education both chose other careers       questions comments suggestions email us at infolivestockweeklycom 6  6 fax   copyright š  livestock weekly po box 6 san angelo tx 6 ted gray jr  senior
