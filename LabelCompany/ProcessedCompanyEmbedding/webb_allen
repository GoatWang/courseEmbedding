small stuff design small stuff design harry potterinspired potions apothecary cabinet i have a confession to make im yearsold and have just now discovered harry potter i knew about the fandom insanity swirling around book and movie premiers but i didnt pay much attention at the time that was until last fall when i discovered how many credits i had on my audible account how about a book series harry potter mkay why not  poofdamn you jk rowling im hooked im completely obsessed with the whole potter world i love the books and movies and cant wait to throw a hogwarts party im like a dog with a bone when i get obsessed about something immersing myself completely and love to use these inspirations in my creationspart of the charm of the stories is how creative the fan base can be its a lot like doctor who in that respect i love the crafts that have been inspired from all the hp stories and of course i want to try them all ive started making wands ill post later and because ive been wanting to do some altered bottles a potions cabinet was a must to createfirst i had to find a shelf thrift shops usually have some sort of shallow spice cabinet shelves hanging around so i was off to goodwill and found this this dusty old bath shelf fit the bill with its sturdy construction and great cubby storage for all those cool potions a quick coat of black acrylic paint and its looking better already the bath plaque had to be disguised though a rummage through my workroom and i found the perfect brass stamping from bsue boutiques large victorian and the perfect thing to cover the bath applique i used black gilders paste on the brass to bring out all the wonderful detail i also had these tim holtz labels hanging around so i used those too if they look a little wonky its not your eyes the labels had this sort of channel looking thing sticking out the back and i needed them to be flush with the shelf i ended up bending them out and using them as part of the design since the damn channels would not be cut off it makes them look more rustic right ahem time to work on some bottles if you do a search on pinterest for harry potter potion bottles labels free printables youll squee with delight at the variety i love them all and thought this set was so cool as it had some color and aging already done in the design it does take some time to cut these out and you want to take care to leave off any white space around the labels potion bottles coming together i didnt take pictures of how i did this but i used decoupage glue to labels to the bottles and covered the entire bottles with the glue on some bottles i painted on top of the glue once it dried to give texture and aging to the surface again do a pinterest search for cheap bottles and youll get some great results of course the other option is to recycle old spice vinegar and condiment bottles i wanted some amber colored bottles so i got my supplies from specialty bottle i added some embellishments on the bottles found some other fun stuff to use with the cabinet including a brass key one of the wands im working on and an old moon and stars pin that has a great patina time to put it all together looking pretty good but it needs a back im thinking again i didnt take pictures but i did a measurement of the back cut out cardboard decoupaged the dictionary paper on the back and attached to the shelf snazzy so there you have it an apothecary fit for severus snape i did some final touches on the bottles added caps cracked marbles and more embellishments on some of the smaller bottles im really pleased with how this turned out and i cant wait to use it for the party brass stamping detail i used black gilders paste to bring out the awesome detail youll also see a peek of a wand im working on this one is made from an oversized chopstick some more detail on the bottles potter peeps will get the r on the wolfs bane bottle hee hee oh and is that a painted repurposed iphone box why yes it is look how fancy more bottle close ups happy accident on the polyjuice bottle the label when i was decoupaging had lifted the image leaving white it was too big to leave so i started coloring in with a black marker the image started to look like a cat which if you know the story about hermione youll understand how cool that is i liked the metal altered tag too thats a peruvian skull bead on the dried spider vial and a cracked marble on the truth serum  before and after cooh huh so there you have it i hope youve enjoyed watching this transformation and think about doing one yourself i

of these controversies are involved with allen which contributed to his downfall and eventual defeat contents  allens barr labs investment  allens macaca controversy  webbs reagan ad  allen at fairfax county republican committees ethnic rally  webbs stance on women in combat  allens remarks about his jewish heritage  pac ad on allens body armor vote  allens use of racial epithets  sons of confederate veterans  webbs use of racial epithets  allens undisclosed business interests  webbs name truncated on ballots  sexually explicit passages from webb novels  allens arrest warrant records  allen supporters attack blogger  telephone intimidation  references allens barr labs investmentedit on august   it was reported that allen who opposes abortion rights owned stock in barr laboratories maker of the plan b morningafter pill an emergency contraceptive intended to prevent pregnancy if taken within  hours of intercourse the webb campaign criticized allen for holding stock in a company that makes a product that many of his supporters oppose allen responded by saying that he holds the stock because barr labs has created jobs in virginia and by pointing to his consistently prolife voting record allen has no plans to sell the stock allens macaca controversyedit further information macaca term on august   george allen twice called sr sidarth a yearold webb campaign volunteer macaca sidarth is of indian ancestry but was born and raised in fairfax county virginia as a tracker for the opposing webb campaign sidarth was filming an allen campaign stop in breaks virginia near the kentucky border during a speech allen paused then began referring to sidarth “ this fellow here over here with the yellow shirt macaca or whatever his name is hes with my opponent hes following us around everywhere and its just great were going to places all over virginia and hes having it on film and its great to have you here and you show it to your opponent because hes never been there and probably will never come  lets give a welcome to macaca here welcome to america and the real world of virginia ” according to sidarth he was the only nonwhite person present among the crowd of  or so republican supporters some of whom applauded allens remarks the webb campaign accused allen of using a racial insult macaca has been identified as a francophone epithet for north african indigenes and commentators have suggested that he may have heard the slur from his mother henrietta etty allen who is a piednoir or north african in allens case a tunisian of french nationality during a televised debate on september  reporter peggy fox asked allen if he had learned the slur from his mother etty allen denied that she had ever used the word before according to the washington post allens campaign manager initially dismissed the incident with an expletive allen later said that he had heard his staff use the term macaca in reference to sidarth that he did not know what the word meant and that he did not intend to insult sidarths ethnicity when he singled him out to the crowd i do apologize if hes offended by that allen said adding that i would never want to demean him as an individual shortly after allens campaign held that he used the word in reference to sidarths hairstyle although sidarth was wearing a baseball cap on the day of the incident he had been conversing casually with allens aides during campaign stops before the incident allens campaign staff claim to have referred to him privately as mohawk a now widely disseminated photo of sidarth hosted by the webb campaign shows sidarths hair to be longer in the middle and shaved on the sides typical of a mohawk on august   john reid allens communications director told the new york times that members of allens campaign had goodnaturedly nicknamed sidarth mohawk when speaking among themselves but could not explain how the word might have morphed into macaca reid told the times that sidarth only received a nickname from allen campaign staff because he would not give his real name interviewed that day on cnn however sidarth recalled shaking allens hand earlier in the week and giving his name hes very good with names legendarily he tries very hard to remember peoples names when meeting them sidarth said as for the macaca remark i am disappointed that someone like a senator of the united states could use something so completely offensive on august   the national journal reported that two virginia republicans who heard the word used by allens campaign staff said macaca was a neologism created from mohawk and caca spanish and french slang for excrement the national journal quoted a republican close to the campaign saying in other words sidarth was a shithead an annoyance by august   allen began insisting that he had never before heard the word and that he simply made it up contrary to original explanations from allen and his staff after several public apologies allen called sidarth twelve days after the incident on august  to apologize directly for his remarks allens campaign manager dick wadhams has continued to blame opponent webb the media and allens leftist foes for a feeding frenzy the incident reduced allens oncebroad polling margin over webb to single digits on september  john podhoretz used the name felix macacawitz as a headline for a post in the national review blog the corner on october  weed for congress field organizer meryl ibis resigned after she used the name in an email to supporters of weed some political observers believe the incident shows an earlystcentury shift in american politics saloncom named sidarth its  person of the year michael scherer wrote sidarth was the kid next door he not allen was the real virginian he was proof that every hour his native commonwealth drifts further from the orbit of the gops solid south and toward a day when allens act will be a tacky antique allen was the past sidarth is the wired diverse future  of virginia the political process and the country  relating to the allen controversy macaca was named the most politically incorrect word of  on december  by global language monitor a nonprofit group that studies word usage despite his initial offense at the term sidarth later embraced it in a washington post opinion piece titled i am macaca weeks following allens comment sidarth wrote an entrance essay for a larry sabatotaught class at the university of virginia of only three words i am macaca webbs reagan adedit on september   webb released his first television advertisement it featured footage of a  speech by ronald reagan praising webb at the secretarys alma mater the united states naval academy in  the next day an official working for the reagan presidential foundation faxed a letter to webbs campaign on behalf of former first lady nancy reagan urging them not to air the advertisement in response webb told reporters that if ronald reagan had made any speeches about allen his opponents campaign would probably use them too i would encourage them to try to go find some the webb advertisement also aired in norfolk roanoke and northern virginia the reagan library has asked other political campaigns to pull advertising involving the former presidents image in  it criticized the conservative club for growth for an advertisement comparing george w bush to reagan on september   a washington post editorial supported webbs advertisement and chided the allen campaign for crying foul saying that neither protest by allens campaign or reagans library later corrected to the reagan presidential foundation has any merit “ the president is a public official paid by the taxpayers his speeches are in the public domain they belong to all americans and to history his words may fairly be the subject of bitter debate and divergent interpretation for decades or centuries to come but they should not be censored posthumously in this instance mr webb has neither distorted mr reagans words nor taken them out of context nor did mr reagan ever repudiate them ” allen at fairfax county republican committees ethnic rallyedit on september   allen attended along with other republican elected officials and candidates for public office an ethnic community rally at thomas edison high school in fairfax county virginia the fairfax county republican committee together with several ethnicallybased republican groups had sponsored this event for the past several years participating organizations included local republican groups drawn from the asian american african american and hispanic american communities among others a small group of protesters demonstrated outside the high school including one activist dressed in a gorilla costume as a reference to allens macaca remark one protester said she was there to let him george allen know that racism is not acceptable while another protester suggested that allen was holding a fake diversity rally both allen and webbs supporters videorecorded the event webb supporters claim the videos show more white faces than nonwhite the virginianpilot described the crowd as chiefly asianamerican webb according to exit polls went on to win all minority groups overwhelmingly including asianamericans webbs stance on women in combatedit jim webb at a rally c september   on september   five female graduates of the united states naval academy had a press conference promoted by the allen campaign to assail a washingtonian article webb wrote in  they accuse webb of fostering an air of hostility and harassment towards females within the academy in the article entitled women cant fight webb described his personal experiences in the vietnam war as a us marine infantry officer and explained why he believed combat was an inappropriate environment for women webb also wrote that he had never met a woman whom he would trust to provide those men with combat leadership the article also characterized the naval academy dormitory situation as a horny womans dream due to the ratio of men to women being ⅓ to  at the time the five women who attended the naval academy from the late s to early s asserted that the article led to male midshipmen constantly harassing and humiliating them some even went so far as to wear jim webb fan club tshirts in response to the allegations webbs campaign released a statement that he wrote the article during a time of great emotional debate over a wide array of social issues in this country and the tone of this article was no exception he added that he is completely comfortable with the present roles of women within the naval academy and the modern military webb expressed that at the time he wrote the article he did not anticipate its effects and to the extent that my writing subjected women at the academy or the active armed forces to undue hardship i remain profoundly sorry allen himself has come under fire for similar attitudes he supported regarding the virginia military institute allen remarked in  that women should not be in foxholes and that the purpose of the armed services is not to be a social experiment a  candidateguide published by the virginianpilot reiterated this stance of allens allens remarks about his jewish heritageedit in the wake of the macaca controversy the jewish periodical the forward reported that in all likelihood allens mother etty allen née henrietta lumbroso was jewish from the august sephardic jewish lumbroso family and that therefore by the jewish legal rule of matrilineal descent allen himself would be considered jewish on september   allen and webb debated each other at the fairfax county chamber of commerce one of the more interesting aspects of this debate came when allen was questioned by wusatv anchor peggy fox fox said it has been reported that your grandfather felix whom you were given your middle name for was jewish could you please tell us whether your forebears include jews and if so at which point jewish identity might have ended this led to a booing from the crowd and anger from allen who admonished fox for making aspersions and responded to be getting into what religion my mother is i dont think is relevantwhy is that relevant  my religion jims religion or the religious beliefs of anyone out theremy mother is frenchitalian with a little spanish blood in her the next day allen issued a statement both confirming and distancing himself from his mothers jewish ancestry the statement read “ i was raised as a christian and my mother was raised as a christian and i embrace and take great pride in every aspect of my diverse heritage including my lumbroso family line’s jewish heritage which i learned about from a recent magazine article and my mother confirmed ” allen also told the richmond timesdispatch in a reference to kosher dieting i still had a ham sandwich for lunch and my mother made great pork chops the washington post reported that allens mother feared retribution against her family if her religious and ethnic background became public and had originally asked allen to keep that information private although no mention is made of her mothers religion in allens sisters book she does mention that the catholic church before marrying the couple required allens parents to agree that any children would be raised catholic and as a result they decided to be married by a justice of the peace in the home of a jewish friend pac ad on allens body armor voteedit in midseptember votevetsorg a political action committee formed in  that is primarily composed of former iraq and afghanistan veterans and headed by jon soltz released a television advertisement criticizing allen for voting against body armor for us troops in  the claim was based on allens vote against a democratic amendment that would have increased national guard funding for body armor various organizations subsequently attempted to assess the validity of the claim the arizona republic ran a piece headlined votevets ad is pure deceit factcheckorg said the ad contained false claims but media matters for america said allen voted against troop body armor not once but twice in march  allen voted against a bill that targets shortfalls identified by the national guard and reserve in their unfunded requirement lists including the shortage of helmets tents bulletproof inserts and tactical vests on october   allen voted against a democratic amendment by senator christopher dodd to add  million to the  million for body armor and battlefield cleanup that the senate appropriations committee had already attached to an  billion emergency supplemental bill allens use of racial epithetsedit salon published a story in late september reporting that three of allens former college football teammates said that during the s allen repeatedly used an inflammatory racial epithet and demonstrated racist attitudes toward blacks on september  edward sabornie a professor at north carolina state university who had been in allens class and played football with him decided to go on record with his allegations sabornie had commented under condition of anonymity in salons previous article about allens use of the slur in that article he was described as a white teammate and commented that using racial epithets was so common with george when he was among his white friends it was the terminology he used sabornie also recalled allen as having referred to blacks as roaches and latinos as wetbacks following the first salon article pundit larry sabato who attended the university of virginia at the same time as allen stated on a televised interview that he knew for a fact that allen used the epithet sabato later recanted saying that he had only heard that rumor from someone else allen called the claims ludicrously false explaining the story and sheltons comments and assertions in the claim are completely false i dont remember ever using that word and it is absolutely false that that was ever part of my vocabulary sons of confederate veteransedit on september   the sons of confederate veterans criticized allen when the group claimed allen criticized southern heritage by stating that he had come to recognize that the confederate battle flag had negative racial overtones webbs use of racial epithetsedit in late september webb was asked if he had ever used the word nigger webb replied that i dont think that theres anyone who grew up around the south that hasnt had the word pass through their lips at one time in their life webb noted that that word and a lot of other epithets were in fields of fire a novel webb wrote about the vietnam war allen campaign officials referred reporters to dan cragg a former acquaintance of webbs cragg said that webb told him in  that webb and members of his rotc unit at the university of southern california would hop into their cars and would go down to watts taking fake rifles and yell out epithets point the rifles at them black people pull the triggers and then drive off laughing cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related but it is absent from the tape spokeswoman kristian denny todd quoted webb as saying in  you couldnt go to watts and do that kind of thing youd get killed so of course i didnt do it i would never do that i would never want to do that webb also produced a friend from the time who claimed that the two had never driven to watts as claimed an october   article in the washington post quotes a recent interview with webb concerning the portrayal of ethnic stereotypes in hollywood webb said towelheads and rednecks  of which i am one if you write that word please say that i mean i dont use that pejoratively i use it defensively towelheads and rednecks became the easy villains in so many movies out there allens undisclosed business interestsedit on october   the associated press reviewing five years of allens financial records reported that allen did not properly report income and stock options from companies which have federal contracts and contacted the army to help a company in which he has an interest allens staff said allen believed in good faith that he did not need to report the stock options because their purchase price was higher than the current market value following the ap report allen asked the senate ethics committee for an opinion on whether he should have disclosed his options the ethics committee ruled than allen was not required to disclose his stock options and did not err in not doing so webbs name truncated on ballotsedit on october   the washington post reported that webbs last name would be truncated on electronic ballots used in alexandria falls church and charlottesville webbs name should have appeared as james h jim webb but only james h jim showed on a summary page due to the font size used on the intercivic voting machines allens name george f allen was not affected by this glitch the virginia state board of elections pledged to have it fixed by the  statewide elections and to post signs warning voters of this error sexually explicit passages from webb novelsedit on october   the drudge report posted a press release reprinting and commenting on sexually explicit passages from webbs novels one excerpt involved a man placing his sons penis in his mouth others involved allegedly sexist portrayals of women the press release which the drudge report attributed to the allen campaign said the passages fit a continued pattern of demeaning women in which webb refuses to portray women in a respectful positive light allens campaign refused to tell a local radio news station wtopfm whether it in fact had issued a news release on the matter in a radio interview on october   webb described the allen campaigns tactics as smear after smear and called the attack on his fiction baseless character assassination webb defended his fiction work saying that the duty of a writer is to illuminate his surroundings he said that the scene involving the man and his son was based upon an incident in a bangkok slum that he witnessed as a journalist and that it was not a sexual act responding to the controversy allen stated my record as a united states senator is an open book my opponent has a record as well he in his advertisements points out that hes an author that hes a writer of books thats part of his record these passages in his books are part of his open record ill let the people of virginia be the judge as to whose record they are more comfortable with at a campaign rally in annandale on october   webb noted that his novel fields of fire has been on the commandant of the marine corps reading list for twenty years and claimed that it is the mosttaught piece of literature regarding the vietnam war on college campuses webb further listed the various accolades his books have received allens arrest warrant recordsedit the democratic senatorial campaign committee has criticized allen for his refusal to release documents that would potentially shed light on the multiple warrants that were issued for his arrest in  allen supporters attack bloggeredit on october  footage of multiple allen supporters attacking a constituent mike stark during a campaign stop in charlottesville virginia began to circulate among various news organizations and online sources stark a liberal blogger marine veteran and law student attempted to ask allen about his missing arrest records and the reasons for the sealing of his divorce papers after yelling out a question about rumors of allen having assaulted his first wife stark was briefly placed in a headlock restrained slung to the ground and forcibly escorted from the hotel by three allen supporters stark was detained several days later at another rally after an allen supporter claimed stark pushed him to the ground telephone intimidationedit the fbi launched an investigation into alleged attempts to intimidate potential democratic voters in eight counties before the poll by use of telephone calls to suggest that persons with outstanding warrants would be arrested as they voted a classic example of voter suppression

allen supporters attack blogger  telephone intimidation  references allens barr labs investmentedit on august   it was reported that allen who opposes abortion rights owned stock in barr laboratories maker of the plan b morningafter pill an emergency contraceptive intended to prevent pregnancy if taken within  hours of intercourse the webb campaign criticized allen for holding stock in a company that makes a product that many of his supporters oppose allen responded by saying that he holds the stock because barr labs has created jobs in virginia and by pointing to his consistently prolife voting record allen has no plans to sell the stock allens macaca controversyedit further information macaca term on august   george allen twice called sr sidarth a yearold webb campaign volunteer macaca sidarth is of indian ancestry but was born and raised in fairfax county virginia as a tracker for the opposing webb campaign sidarth was filming an allen campaign stop in breaks virginia near the kentucky border during a speech allen paused then began referring to sidarth “ this fellow here over here with the yellow shirt macaca or whatever his name is hes with my opponent hes following us around everywhere and its just great were going to places all over virginia and hes having it on film and its great to have you here and you show it to your opponent because hes never been there and probably will never come  lets give a welcome to macaca here welcome to america and the real world of virginia ” according to sidarth he was the only nonwhite person present among the crowd of  or so republican supporters some of whom applauded allens remarks the webb campaign accused allen of using a racial insult macaca has been identified as a francophone epithet for north african indigenes and commentators have suggested that he may have heard the slur from his mother henrietta etty allen who is a piednoir or north african in allens case a tunisian of french nationality during a televised debate on september  reporter peggy fox asked allen if he had learned the slur from his mother etty allen denied that she had ever used the word before according to the washington post allens campaign manager initially dismissed the incident with an expletive allen later said that he had heard his staff use the term macaca in reference to sidarth that he did not know what the word meant and that he did not intend to insult sidarths ethnicity when he singled him out to the crowd i do apologize if hes offended by that allen said adding that i would never want to demean him as an individual shortly after allens campaign held that he used the word in reference to sidarths hairstyle although sidarth was wearing a baseball cap on the day of the incident he had been conversing casually with allens aides during campaign stops before the incident allens campaign staff claim to have referred to him privately as mohawk a now widely disseminated photo of sidarth hosted by the webb campaign shows sidarths hair to be longer in the middle and shaved on the sides typical of a mohawk on august   john reid allens communications director told the new york times that members of allens campaign had goodnaturedly nicknamed sidarth mohawk when speaking among themselves but could not explain how the word might have morphed into macaca reid told the times that sidarth only received a nickname from allen campaign staff because he would not give his real name interviewed that day on cnn however sidarth recalled shaking allens hand earlier in the week and giving his name hes very good with names legendarily he tries very hard to remember peoples names when meeting them sidarth said as for the macaca remark i am disappointed that someone like a senator of the united states could use something so completely offensive on august   the national journal reported that two virginia republicans who heard the word used by allens campaign staff said macaca was a neologism created from mohawk and caca spanish and french slang for excrement the national journal quoted a republican close to the campaign saying in other words sidarth was a shithead an annoyance by august   allen began insisting that he had never before heard the word and that he simply made it up contrary to original explanations from allen and his staff after several public apologies allen called sidarth twelve days after the incident on august  to apologize directly for his remarks allens campaign manager dick wadhams has continued to blame opponent webb the media and allens leftist foes for a feeding frenzy the incident reduced allens oncebroad polling margin over webb to single digits on september  john podhoretz used the name felix macacawitz as a headline for a post in the national review blog the corner on october  weed for congress field organizer meryl ibis resigned after she used the name in an email to supporters of weed some political observers believe the incident shows an earlystcentury shift in american politics saloncom named sidarth its  person of the year michael scherer wrote sidarth was the kid next door he not allen was the real virginian he was proof that every hour his native commonwealth drifts further from the orbit of the gops solid south and toward a day when allens act will be a tacky antique allen was the past sidarth is the wired diverse future  of virginia the political process and the country  relating to the allen controversy macaca was named the most politically incorrect word of  on december  by global language monitor a nonprofit group that studies word usage despite his initial offense at the term sidarth later embraced it in a washington post opinion piece titled i am macaca weeks following allens comment sidarth wrote an entrance essay for a larry sabatotaught class at the university of virginia of only three words i am macaca webbs reagan adedit on september   webb released his first television advertisement it featured footage of a  speech by ronald reagan praising webb at the secretarys alma mater the united states naval academy in  the next day an official working for the reagan presidential foundation faxed a letter to webbs campaign on behalf of former first lady nancy reagan urging them not to air the advertisement in response webb told reporters that if ronald reagan had made any speeches about allen his opponents campaign would probably use them too i would encourage them to try to go find some the webb advertisement also aired in norfolk roanoke and northern virginia the reagan library has asked other political campaigns to pull advertising involving the former presidents image in  it criticized the conservative club for growth for an advertisement comparing george w bush to reagan on september   a washington post editorial supported webbs advertisement and chided the allen campaign for crying foul saying that neither protest by allens campaign or reagans library later corrected to the reagan presidential foundation has any merit “ the president is a public official paid by the taxpayers his speeches are in the public domain they belong to all americans and to history his words may fairly be the subject of bitter debate and divergent interpretation for decades or centuries to come but they should not be censored posthumously in this instance mr webb has neither distorted mr reagans words nor taken them out of context nor did mr reagan ever repudiate them ” allen at fairfax county republican committees ethnic rallyedit on september   allen attended along with other republican elected officials and candidates for public office an ethnic community rally at thomas edison high school in fairfax county virginia the fairfax county republican committee together with several ethnicallybased republican groups had sponsored this event for the past several years participating organizations included local republican groups drawn from the asian american african american and hispanic american communities among others a small group of protesters demonstrated outside the high school including one activist dressed in a gorilla costume as a reference to allens macaca remark one protester said she was there to let him george allen know that racism is not acceptable while another protester suggested that allen was holding a fake diversity rally both allen and webbs supporters videorecorded the event webb supporters claim the videos show more white faces than nonwhite the virginianpilot described the crowd as chiefly asianamerican webb according to exit polls went on to win all minority groups overwhelmingly including asianamericans webbs stance on women in combatedit jim webb at a rally c september   on september   five female graduates of the united states naval academy had a press conference promoted by the allen campaign to assail a washingtonian article webb wrote in  they accuse webb of fostering an air of hostility and harassment towards females within the academy in the article entitled women cant fight webb described his personal experiences in the vietnam war as a us marine infantry officer and explained why he believed combat was an inappropriate environment for women webb also wrote that he had never met a woman whom he would trust to provide those men with combat leadership the article also characterized the naval academy dormitory situation as a horny womans dream due to the ratio of men to women being ⅓ to  at the time the five women who attended the naval academy from the late s to early s asserted that the article led to male midshipmen constantly harassing and humiliating them some even went so far as to wear jim webb fan club tshirts in response to the allegations webbs campaign released a statement that he wrote the article during a time of great emotional debate over a wide array of social issues in this country and the tone of this article was no exception he added that he is completely comfortable with the present roles of women within the naval academy and the modern military webb expressed that at the time he wrote the article he did not anticipate its effects and to the extent that my writing subjected women at the academy or the active armed forces to undue hardship i remain profoundly sorry allen himself has come under fire for similar attitudes he supported regarding the virginia military institute allen remarked in  that women should not be in foxholes and that the purpose of the armed services is not to be a social experiment a  candidateguide published by the virginianpilot reiterated this stance of allens allens remarks about his jewish heritageedit in the wake of the macaca controversy the jewish periodical the forward reported that in all likelihood allens mother etty allen née henrietta lumbroso was jewish from the august sephardic jewish lumbroso family and that therefore by the jewish legal rule of matrilineal descent allen himself would be considered jewish on september   allen and webb debated each other at the fairfax county chamber of commerce one of the more interesting aspects of this debate came when allen was questioned by wusatv anchor peggy fox fox said it has been reported that your grandfather felix whom you were given your middle name for was jewish could you please tell us whether your forebears include jews and if so at which point jewish identity might have ended this led to a booing from the crowd and anger from allen who admonished fox for making aspersions and responded to be getting into what religion my mother is i dont think is relevantwhy is that relevant  my religion jims religion or the religious beliefs of anyone out theremy mother is frenchitalian with a little spanish blood in her the next day allen issued a statement both confirming and distancing himself from his mothers jewish ancestry the statement read “ i was raised as a christian and my mother was raised as a christian and i embrace and take great pride in every aspect of my diverse heritage including my lumbroso family line’s jewish heritage which i learned about from a recent magazine article and my mother confirmed ” allen also told the richmond timesdispatch in a reference to kosher dieting i still had a ham sandwich for lunch and my mother made great pork chops the washington post reported that allens mother feared retribution against her family if her religious and ethnic background became public and had originally asked allen to keep that information private although no mention is made of her mothers religion in allens sisters book she does mention that the catholic church before marrying the couple required allens parents to agree that any children would be raised catholic and as a result they decided to be married by a justice of the peace in the home of a jewish friend pac ad on allens body armor voteedit in midseptember votevetsorg a political action committee formed in  that is primarily composed of former iraq and afghanistan veterans and headed by jon soltz released a television advertisement criticizing allen for voting against body armor for us troops in  the claim was based on allens vote against a democratic amendment that would have increased national guard funding for body armor various organizations subsequently attempted to assess the validity of the claim the arizona republic ran a piece headlined votevets ad is pure deceit factcheckorg said the ad contained false claims but media matters for america said allen voted against troop body armor not once but twice in march  allen voted against a bill that targets shortfalls identified by the national guard and reserve in their unfunded requirement lists including the shortage of helmets tents bulletproof inserts and tactical vests on october   allen voted against a democratic amendment by senator christopher dodd to add  million to the  million for body armor and battlefield cleanup that the senate appropriations committee had already attached to an  billion emergency supplemental bill allens use of racial epithetsedit salon published a story in late september reporting that three of allens former college football teammates said that during the s allen repeatedly used an inflammatory racial epithet and demonstrated racist attitudes toward blacks on september  edward sabornie a professor at north carolina state university who had been in allens class and played football with him decided to go on record with his allegations sabornie had commented under condition of anonymity in salons previous article about allens use of the slur in that article he was described as a white teammate and commented that using racial epithets was so common with george when he was among his white friends it was the terminology he used sabornie also recalled allen as having referred to blacks as roaches and latinos as wetbacks following the first salon article pundit larry sabato who attended the university of virginia at the same time as allen stated on a televised interview that he knew for a fact that allen used the epithet sabato later recanted saying that he had only heard that rumor from someone else allen called the claims ludicrously false explaining the story and sheltons comments and assertions in the claim are completely false i dont remember ever using that word and it is absolutely false that that was ever part of my vocabulary sons of confederate veteransedit on september   the sons of confederate veterans criticized allen when the group claimed allen criticized southern heritage by stating that he had come to recognize that the confederate battle flag had negative racial overtones webbs use of racial epithetsedit in late september webb was asked if he had ever used the word nigger webb replied that i dont think that theres anyone who grew up around the south that hasnt had the word pass through their lips at one time in their life webb noted that that word and a lot of other epithets were in fields of fire a novel webb wrote about the vietnam war allen campaign officials referred reporters to dan cragg a former acquaintance of webbs cragg said that webb told him in  that webb and members of his rotc unit at the university of southern california would hop into their cars and would go down to watts taking fake rifles and yell out epithets point the rifles at them black people pull the triggers and then drive off laughing cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related but it is absent from the tape spokeswoman kristian denny todd quoted webb as saying in  you couldnt go to watts and do that kind of thing youd get killed so of course i didnt do it i would never do that i would never want to do that webb also produced a friend from the time who claimed that the two had never driven to watts as claimed an october   article in the washington post quotes a recent interview with webb concerning the portrayal of ethnic stereotypes in hollywood webb said towelheads and rednecks  of which i am one if you write that word please say that i mean i dont use that pejoratively i use it defensively towelheads and rednecks became the easy villains in so many movies out there allens undisclosed business interestsedit on october   the associated press reviewing five years of allens financial records reported that allen did not properly report income and stock options from companies which have federal contracts and contacted the army to help a company in which he has an interest allens staff said allen believed in good faith that he did not need to report the stock options because their purchase price was higher than the current market value following the ap report allen asked the senate ethics committee for an opinion on whether he should have disclosed his options the ethics committee ruled than allen was not required to disclose his stock options and did not err in not doing so webbs name truncated on ballotsedit on october   the washington post reported that webbs last name would be truncated on electronic ballots used in alexandria falls church and charlottesville webbs name should have appeared as james h jim webb but only james h jim showed on a summary page due to the font size used on the intercivic voting machines allens name george f allen was not affected by this glitch the virginia state board of elections pledged to have it fixed by the  statewide elections and to post signs warning voters of this error sexually explicit passages from webb novelsedit on october   the drudge report posted a press release reprinting and commenting on sexually explicit passages from webbs novels one excerpt involved a man placing his sons penis in his mouth others involved allegedly sexist portrayals of women the press release which the drudge report attributed to the allen campaign said the passages fit a continued pattern of demeaning women in which webb refuses to portray women in a respectful positive light allens campaign refused to tell a local radio news station wtopfm whether it in fact had issued a news release on the matter in a radio interview on october   webb described the allen campaigns tactics as smear after smear and called the attack on his fiction baseless character assassination webb defended his fiction work saying that the duty of a writer is to illuminate his surroundings he said that the scene involving the man and his son was based upon an incident in a bangkok slum that he witnessed as a journalist and that it was not a sexual act responding to the controversy allen stated my record as a united states senator is an open book my opponent has a record as well he in his advertisements points out that hes an author that hes a writer of books thats part of his record these passages in his books are part of his open record ill let the people of virginia be the judge as to whose record they are more comfortable with at a campaign rally in annandale on october   webb noted that his novel fields of fire has been on the commandant of the marine corps reading list for twenty years and claimed that it is the mosttaught piece of literature regarding the vietnam war on college campuses webb further listed the various accolades his books have received allens arrest warrant recordsedit the democratic senatorial campaign committee has criticized allen for his refusal to release documents that would potentially shed light on the multiple warrants that were issued for his arrest in  allen supporters attack bloggeredit on october  footage of multiple allen supporters attacking a constituent mike stark during a campaign stop in charlottesville virginia began to circulate among various news organizations and online sources stark a liberal blogger marine veteran and law student attempted to ask allen about his missing arrest records and the reasons for the sealing of his divorce papers after yelling out a question about rumors of allen having assaulted his first wife stark was briefly placed in a headlock restrained slung to the ground and forcibly escorted from the hotel by three allen supporters stark was detained several days later at another rally after an allen supporter claimed stark pushed him to the ground telephone intimidationedit the fbi launched an investigation into alleged attempts to intimidate potential

manager initially dismissed the incident with an expletive allen later said that he had heard his staff use the term macaca in reference to sidarth that he did not know what the word meant and that he did not intend to insult sidarths ethnicity when he singled him out to the crowd i do apologize if hes offended by that allen said adding that i would never want to demean him as an individual shortly

aides during campaign stops before the incident allens campaign staff claim to have referred to him privately as mohawk a now widely disseminated photo of sidarth hosted by the webb campaign shows sidarths hair to be longer in the middle and shaved on the sides typical of a mohawk on august   john reid allens communications director told the new york times that members of allens campaign had goodnaturedly nicknamed sidarth mohawk when speaking among themselves but could not explain how the word might have morphed into macaca reid told the times that sidarth only received a nickname from allen campaign staff because he would not give his real name interviewed that day on cnn however sidarth recalled shaking allens hand earlier in the week and giving his name hes very good with names legendarily he tries very hard to remember peoples names when meeting them sidarth said as for the macaca remark i am disappointed that someone like a senator of the united states could use something so completely offensive on august   the national journal reported that two virginia republicans who heard the word used by allens campaign staff said macaca was a neologism created from mohawk and caca spanish and french slang for excrement the national journal quoted a republican close to the campaign saying in other words sidarth was a shithead an annoyance by august   allen began insisting that he had never before heard the word and that he simply made it up contrary to original explanations from allen and his staff after several public apologies allen called sidarth twelve days after the incident on august  to apologize directly for his remarks allens campaign manager dick wadhams has continued to blame opponent webb the media and allens leftist foes for a feeding frenzy the incident reduced allens oncebroad polling margin over webb to single digits on september  john podhoretz used the name felix macacawitz as a headline for a post in the national review blog the corner on october  weed for congress field organizer meryl ibis resigned after she used the name in an email to supporters of weed some political observers believe the incident shows an earlystcentury shift in american politics saloncom named sidarth its  person of the year michael scherer wrote sidarth was the kid next door he not allen was the real virginian he was proof that every hour his native commonwealth drifts further from the orbit of the gops solid south and toward a day when allens act will be a tacky antique allen was the past sidarth is the wired diverse future  of virginia the political process and the country  relating to the allen controversy macaca was named the most politically incorrect word of  on december  by global language monitor a nonprofit group that studies word usage despite his initial offense at the term sidarth later embraced it in a washington post opinion piece titled i am macaca weeks following allens comment sidarth wrote an entrance essay for a larry sabatotaught class at the university of virginia of only three words i am macaca webbs reagan adedit on september   webb released his first television advertisement it featured footage of a  speech by ronald reagan praising webb at the secretarys alma mater the united states naval academy in  the next day an official working for the reagan presidential foundation faxed a letter to webbs campaign on behalf of former first lady nancy reagan urging them not to air the advertisement in response webb told reporters that if ronald reagan had made any speeches about allen his opponents campaign would probably use them too i would encourage them to try to go find some the webb advertisement also aired in norfolk roanoke and northern virginia the reagan library has asked other political campaigns to pull advertising involving the former presidents image in  it criticized the conservative club for growth for an advertisement comparing george w bush to reagan on september   a washington post editorial supported webbs advertisement and chided the allen campaign for crying foul saying that neither protest by allens campaign or reagans library later corrected to the reagan presidential foundation has any merit “ the president is a public official paid by the taxpayers his speeches are in the public domain they belong to all americans and to history his words may fairly be the subject of bitter debate and divergent interpretation for decades or centuries to come but they should not be censored posthumously in this instance mr webb has neither distorted mr reagans words nor taken them out of context nor did mr reagan ever repudiate them ” allen at fairfax county republican committees ethnic rallyedit on september   allen attended along with other republican elected officials and candidates for public office an ethnic community rally at thomas edison high school in fairfax county virginia the fairfax county republican committee together with several ethnicallybased republican groups had sponsored this event for the past several years participating organizations included local republican groups drawn from the asian american african american and hispanic american communities among others a small group of protesters demonstrated outside the high school including one activist dressed in a gorilla costume as a reference to allens macaca remark one protester said she was there to let him george allen know that racism is not acceptable while another protester suggested that allen was holding a fake diversity rally both allen and webbs supporters videorecorded the event webb supporters claim the videos show more white faces than nonwhite the virginianpilot described the crowd as chiefly asianamerican webb according to exit polls went on to win all minority groups overwhelmingly including asianamericans webbs stance on women in combatedit jim webb at a rally c september   on september   five female graduates of the united states naval academy had a press conference promoted by the allen campaign to assail a washingtonian article webb wrote in  they accuse webb of fostering an air of hostility and harassment towards females within the academy in the article entitled women cant fight webb described his personal experiences in the vietnam war as a us marine infantry officer and explained why he believed combat was an inappropriate environment for women webb also wrote that he had never met a woman whom he would trust to provide those men with combat leadership the article also characterized the naval academy dormitory situation as a horny womans dream due to the ratio of men to women being ⅓ to  at the time the five women who attended the naval academy from the late s to early s asserted that the article led to male midshipmen constantly harassing and humiliating them some even went so far as to wear jim webb fan club tshirts in response to the allegations webbs campaign released a statement that he wrote the article during a time of great emotional debate over a wide array of social issues in this country and the tone of this article was no exception he added that he is completely comfortable with the present roles of women within the naval academy and the modern military webb expressed that at the time he wrote the article he did not anticipate its effects and to the extent that my writing subjected women at the academy or the active armed forces to undue hardship i remain profoundly sorry allen himself has come under fire for similar attitudes he supported regarding the virginia military institute allen remarked in  that women should not be in foxholes and that the purpose of the armed services is not to be a social experiment a  candidateguide published by the virginianpilot reiterated this stance of allens allens remarks about his jewish heritageedit in the wake of the macaca controversy the jewish periodical the forward reported that in all likelihood allens mother etty allen née henrietta lumbroso was jewish from the august sephardic jewish lumbroso family and that therefore by the jewish legal rule of matrilineal descent allen himself would be considered jewish on september   allen and webb debated each other at the fairfax county chamber of commerce one of the more interesting aspects of this debate came when allen was questioned by wusatv anchor peggy fox fox said it has been reported that your grandfather felix whom you were given your middle name for was jewish could you please tell us whether your forebears include jews and if so at which point jewish identity might have ended this led to a booing from the crowd and anger from allen who admonished fox for making aspersions and responded to be getting into what religion my mother is i dont think is relevantwhy is that relevant  my religion jims religion or the religious beliefs of anyone out theremy mother is frenchitalian with a little spanish blood in her the next day allen issued a statement both confirming and distancing himself from his mothers jewish ancestry the statement read “ i was raised as a christian and my mother was raised as a christian and i embrace and take great pride in every aspect of my diverse heritage including my lumbroso family line’s jewish heritage which i learned about from a recent magazine article and my mother confirmed ” allen also told the richmond timesdispatch in a reference to kosher dieting i still had a ham sandwich for lunch and my mother made great pork chops the washington post reported that allens mother feared retribution against her family if her religious and ethnic background became public and had originally asked allen to keep that information private although no mention is made of her mothers religion in allens sisters book she does mention that the catholic church before marrying the couple required allens parents to agree that any children would be raised catholic and as a result they decided to be married by a justice of the peace in the home of a jewish friend pac ad on allens body armor voteedit in midseptember votevetsorg a political action committee formed in  that is primarily composed of former iraq and afghanistan veterans and headed by jon soltz released a television advertisement criticizing allen for voting against body armor for us troops in  the claim was based on allens vote against a democratic amendment that would have increased national guard funding for body armor various organizations subsequently attempted to assess the validity of the claim the arizona republic ran a piece headlined votevets ad is pure deceit factcheckorg said the ad contained false claims but media matters for america said allen voted against troop body armor not once but twice in march  allen voted against a bill that targets shortfalls identified by the national guard and reserve in their unfunded requirement lists including the shortage of helmets tents bulletproof inserts and tactical vests on october   allen voted against a democratic amendment by senator christopher dodd to add  million to the  million for body armor and battlefield cleanup that the senate appropriations committee had already attached to an  billion emergency supplemental bill allens use of racial epithetsedit salon published a story in late september reporting that three of allens former college football teammates said that during the s allen repeatedly used an inflammatory racial epithet and demonstrated racist attitudes toward blacks on september  edward sabornie a professor at north carolina state university who had been in allens class and played football with him decided to go on record with his allegations sabornie had commented under condition of anonymity in salons previous article about allens use of the slur in that article he was described as a white teammate and commented that using racial epithets was so common with george when he was among his white friends it was the terminology he used sabornie also recalled allen as having referred to blacks as roaches and latinos as wetbacks following the first salon article pundit larry sabato who attended the university of virginia at the same time as allen stated on a televised interview that he knew for a fact that allen used the epithet sabato later recanted saying that he had only heard that rumor from someone else allen called the claims ludicrously false explaining the story and sheltons comments and assertions in the claim are completely false i dont remember ever using that word and it is absolutely false that that was ever part of my vocabulary sons of confederate veteransedit on september   the sons of confederate veterans criticized allen when the group claimed allen criticized southern heritage by stating that he had come to recognize that the confederate battle flag had negative racial overtones webbs use of racial epithetsedit in late september webb was asked if he had ever used the word nigger webb replied that i dont think that theres anyone who grew up around the south that hasnt had the word pass through their lips at one time in their life webb noted that that word and a lot of other epithets were in fields of fire a novel webb wrote about the vietnam war allen campaign officials referred reporters to dan cragg a former acquaintance of webbs cragg said that webb told him in  that webb and members of his rotc unit at the university of southern california would hop into their cars and would go down to watts taking fake rifles and yell out epithets point the rifles at them black people pull the triggers and then drive off laughing cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related but it is absent from the tape spokeswoman kristian denny todd quoted webb as saying in  you couldnt go to watts and do that kind of thing youd get killed so of course i didnt do it i would never do that i would never want to do that webb also produced a friend from the time who claimed that the two had never driven to watts as claimed an october   article in the washington post quotes a recent interview with webb concerning the portrayal of ethnic stereotypes in hollywood webb said towelheads and rednecks  of which i am one if you write that word please say that i mean i dont use that pejoratively i use it defensively towelheads and rednecks became the easy villains in so many movies out there allens undisclosed business interestsedit on october   the associated press reviewing five years of allens financial records reported that allen did not properly report income and stock options from companies which have federal contracts and contacted the army to help a company in which he has an interest allens staff said allen believed in good faith that he did not need to report the stock options because their purchase price was higher than the current market value following the ap report allen asked the senate ethics committee for an opinion on whether he should have disclosed his options the ethics committee ruled than allen was not required to disclose his stock options and did not err in not doing so webbs name truncated on ballotsedit on october   the washington post reported that webbs last name would be truncated on electronic ballots used in alexandria falls church and charlottesville webbs name should have appeared as james h jim webb but only james h jim showed on a summary page due to the font size used on the intercivic voting machines allens name george f allen was not affected by this glitch the virginia state board of elections pledged to have it fixed by the  statewide elections and to post signs warning voters of this error sexually explicit passages from webb novelsedit on october   the drudge report posted a press release reprinting and commenting on sexually explicit passages from webbs novels one excerpt involved a man placing his sons penis in his mouth others involved allegedly sexist portrayals of women the press release which the drudge report attributed to the allen campaign said the passages fit a continued pattern of demeaning women in which webb refuses to portray women in a respectful positive light allens campaign refused to tell a local radio news station wtopfm whether it in fact had issued a news release on the matter in a radio interview on october   webb described the allen campaigns tactics as smear after smear and called the attack on his fiction baseless character assassination webb defended his fiction work saying that the duty of a writer is to illuminate his surroundings he said that the scene involving the man and his son was based upon an incident in a bangkok slum that he witnessed as a journalist and that it was not a sexual act responding to the controversy allen stated my record as a united states senator is an open book my opponent has a record as well he in his advertisements points out that hes an author that hes a writer of books thats part of his record these passages in his books are part of his open record ill let the people of virginia be the judge as to whose record they are more comfortable with at a campaign rally in annandale on october   webb noted that his novel fields of fire has been on the commandant of the marine corps reading list for twenty years and claimed that it is the mosttaught piece of literature

in american politics saloncom named sidarth its  person of the year michael scherer wrote sidarth was the kid next door he not allen was the real virginian he was proof that every hour his native commonwealth drifts further from the orbit of the gops solid south and toward a day when allens act will be a tacky antique allen was the past sidarth is the wired diverse future  of virginia the political process and the country  relating to the allen controversy macaca was named the most politically incorrect word of  on december  by global language monitor a nonprofit group that studies word usage despite his initial offense at the term sidarth later embraced it in a washington post opinion piece titled i am macaca weeks following allens comment sidarth wrote an entrance essay for a larry sabatotaught class at the university of virginia of only three words i am macaca webbs reagan adedit on september   webb released his first television advertisement it featured footage of a  speech by ronald reagan praising webb at the secretarys alma mater the united states naval academy in  the next day an official working for the reagan presidential foundation faxed a letter to webbs campaign on behalf of former first lady nancy reagan urging them not to air the advertisement in response webb told reporters that if ronald reagan had made any speeches about allen his opponents campaign would probably use them too i would encourage them to try to go find some the webb advertisement also aired in norfolk roanoke and northern virginia the reagan library has asked other political campaigns to pull advertising involving the former presidents image in  it criticized the conservative club for growth for an advertisement comparing george w bush to reagan on september   a washington post editorial supported webbs advertisement and chided the allen campaign for crying foul saying that neither protest by allens campaign or reagans library later corrected to the reagan presidential foundation has any merit “ the president is a public official paid by the taxpayers his speeches are in the public domain they belong to all americans and to history his words may fairly be the subject of bitter debate and divergent interpretation for decades or centuries to come but they should not be censored posthumously in this instance mr webb has neither distorted mr reagans words nor taken them out of context nor did mr reagan ever repudiate them ” allen at fairfax county republican committees ethnic rallyedit on september   allen attended along with other republican elected officials and candidates for public office an ethnic community rally at thomas edison high school in fairfax county virginia the fairfax county republican committee together with several ethnicallybased republican groups had sponsored this event for the past several years participating organizations included local republican groups drawn from the asian american african american and hispanic american communities among others a small group of protesters demonstrated outside the high school including one activist dressed in a gorilla costume as a reference to allens macaca remark one protester said she was there to let him george allen know that racism is not acceptable while another protester suggested that allen was holding a fake diversity rally both allen and webbs supporters videorecorded the event webb supporters claim the videos show more white faces than nonwhite the virginianpilot described the crowd as chiefly asianamerican webb according to exit polls went on to win all minority groups overwhelmingly including asianamericans webbs stance on women in combatedit jim webb at a rally c september   on september   five female graduates of the united states naval academy had a press conference promoted by the allen campaign to assail a washingtonian article webb wrote in  they accuse webb of fostering an air of hostility and harassment towards females within the academy in the article entitled women cant fight webb described his personal experiences in the vietnam war as a us marine infantry officer and explained why he believed combat was an inappropriate environment for women webb also wrote that he had never met a woman whom he would trust to provide those men with combat leadership the article also characterized the naval academy dormitory situation as a horny womans dream due to the ratio of men to women being ⅓ to  at the time the five women who attended the naval academy from the late s to early s asserted that the article led to male midshipmen constantly harassing and humiliating them some even went so far as to wear jim webb fan club tshirts in response to the allegations webbs campaign released a statement that he wrote the article during a time of great emotional debate over a wide array of social issues in this country and the tone of this article was no exception he added that he is completely comfortable with the present roles of women within the naval academy and the modern military webb expressed that at the time he wrote the article he did not anticipate its effects and to the extent that my writing subjected women at the academy or the active armed forces to undue hardship i remain profoundly sorry allen himself has come under fire for similar attitudes he supported regarding the virginia military institute allen remarked in  that women should not be in foxholes and that the purpose of the armed services is not to be a social experiment a  candidateguide published by the virginianpilot reiterated this stance of allens allens remarks about his jewish heritageedit in the wake of the macaca controversy the jewish periodical the forward reported that in all likelihood allens mother etty allen née henrietta lumbroso was jewish from the august sephardic jewish lumbroso family and that therefore by the jewish legal rule of matrilineal descent allen himself would be considered jewish on september   allen and webb debated each other at the fairfax county chamber of commerce one of the more interesting aspects of this debate came when allen was questioned by wusatv anchor peggy fox fox said it has been reported that your grandfather felix whom you were given your middle name for was jewish could you please tell us whether your forebears include jews and if so at which point jewish identity might have ended this led to a booing from the crowd and anger from allen who admonished fox for making aspersions and responded to be getting into what religion my mother is i dont think is relevantwhy is that relevant  my religion jims religion or the religious beliefs of anyone out theremy mother is frenchitalian with a little spanish blood in her the next day allen issued a statement both confirming and distancing himself from his mothers jewish ancestry the statement read “ i was raised as a christian and my mother was raised as a christian and i embrace and take great pride in every aspect of my diverse heritage including my lumbroso family line’s jewish heritage which i learned about from a recent magazine article and my mother confirmed ” allen also told the richmond timesdispatch in a reference to kosher dieting i still had a ham sandwich for lunch and my mother made great pork chops the washington post reported that allens mother feared retribution against her family if her religious and ethnic background became public and had originally asked allen to keep that information private although no mention is made of her mothers religion in allens sisters book she does mention that the catholic church before marrying the couple required allens parents to agree that any children would be raised catholic and as a result they decided to be married by a justice of the peace in the home of a jewish friend pac ad on allens body armor voteedit in midseptember votevetsorg a political action committee formed in  that is primarily composed of former iraq and afghanistan veterans and headed by jon soltz released a television advertisement criticizing allen for voting against body armor for us troops in  the claim was based on allens vote against a democratic amendment that would have increased national guard funding for body armor various organizations subsequently attempted to assess the validity of the claim the arizona republic ran a piece headlined votevets ad is pure deceit factcheckorg said the ad contained false claims but media matters for america said allen voted against troop body armor not once but twice in march  allen voted against a bill that targets shortfalls identified by the national guard and reserve in their unfunded requirement lists including the shortage of helmets tents bulletproof inserts and tactical vests on october   allen voted against a democratic amendment by senator christopher dodd to add  million to the  million for body armor and battlefield cleanup that the senate appropriations committee had already attached to an  billion emergency supplemental bill allens use of racial epithetsedit salon published a story in late september reporting that three of allens former college football teammates said that during the s allen repeatedly used an inflammatory racial epithet and demonstrated racist attitudes toward blacks on september  edward sabornie a professor at north carolina state university who had been in allens class and played football with him decided to go on record with his allegations sabornie had commented under condition of anonymity in salons previous article about allens use of the slur in that article he was described as a white teammate and commented that using racial epithets was so common with george when he was among his white friends it was the terminology he used sabornie also recalled allen as having referred to blacks as roaches and latinos as wetbacks following the first salon article pundit larry sabato who attended the university of virginia at the same time as allen stated on a televised interview that he knew for a fact that allen used the epithet sabato later recanted saying that he had only heard that rumor from someone else allen called the claims ludicrously false explaining the story and sheltons comments and assertions in the claim are completely false i dont remember ever using that word and it is absolutely false that that was ever part of my vocabulary sons of confederate veteransedit on september   the sons of confederate veterans criticized allen when the group claimed allen criticized southern heritage by stating that he had come to recognize that the confederate battle flag had negative racial overtones webbs use of racial epithetsedit in late september webb was asked if he had ever used the word nigger webb replied that i dont think that theres anyone who grew up around the south that hasnt had the word pass through their lips at one time in their life webb noted that that word and a lot of other epithets were in fields of fire a novel webb wrote about the vietnam war allen campaign officials referred reporters to dan cragg a former acquaintance of webbs cragg said that webb told him in  that webb and members of his rotc unit at the university of southern california would hop into their cars and would go down to watts taking fake rifles and yell out epithets point the rifles at them black people pull the triggers and then drive off laughing cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related but it is absent from the tape spokeswoman kristian denny todd quoted webb as saying in  you couldnt go to watts and do that kind of thing youd get killed so of course i didnt do it i would never do that i would never want to do that webb also produced a friend from the time who claimed that the two had never driven to watts as claimed an october   article in the washington post quotes a recent interview with webb concerning the portrayal of ethnic stereotypes in hollywood webb said towelheads and rednecks  of which i am one if you write that word please say that i mean i dont use that pejoratively i use it defensively towelheads and rednecks became the easy villains in so many movies out there allens undisclosed business interestsedit on october   the associated press reviewing five years of allens financial records reported that allen did not properly report income and stock options from companies which have federal contracts and contacted the army to help a company in which he has an interest allens staff said allen believed in good faith that he did not need to report the stock options because their purchase price was higher than the current market value following the ap report allen asked the senate ethics committee for an opinion on whether he should have disclosed his options the ethics committee ruled than allen was not required to disclose his stock options and did not err in not doing so webbs name truncated on ballotsedit on october   the washington post reported that webbs last name would be truncated on electronic ballots used in alexandria falls church and charlottesville webbs name should have appeared as james h jim webb but only james h jim showed on a summary page due to the font size used on the intercivic voting machines allens name george f allen was not affected by this glitch the virginia state board of elections pledged to have it fixed by the  statewide elections and to post signs warning voters of this error sexually explicit passages from webb novelsedit on october   the drudge report posted a press release reprinting and commenting on sexually explicit passages from webbs novels one excerpt involved a man placing his sons penis in his mouth others involved allegedly sexist portrayals of women the press release which the drudge report attributed to the allen campaign said the passages fit a continued pattern of demeaning women in which webb refuses to portray women in a respectful positive light allens campaign refused to tell a local radio news station wtopfm whether it in fact had issued a news release on the matter in a radio interview on october   webb described the allen campaigns tactics as smear after smear and called the attack on his fiction baseless character assassination webb defended his fiction work saying that the duty of a writer is to illuminate his surroundings he said that the scene involving the man and his son was based upon an incident in a bangkok slum that he witnessed as a journalist and that it was not a sexual act responding to the controversy allen stated my record as a united states senator is an open book my opponent has a record as well he in his advertisements points out that hes an author that hes a writer of books thats part of his record these passages in his books are part of his open record ill let the people of virginia be the judge as to whose record they are more comfortable with at a campaign rally in annandale on october   webb noted that his novel fields of fire has been on the commandant of the marine corps reading list for twenty years and claimed that it is the mosttaught piece of literature regarding the vietnam war on college campuses webb further listed the various accolades his books have received allens arrest warrant recordsedit the democratic senatorial campaign committee has criticized allen for his refusal to release documents that would potentially shed light on the multiple warrants that were issued for his arrest in  allen supporters attack bloggeredit on october  footage of multiple allen supporters attacking a constituent mike stark during a campaign stop in charlottesville virginia began to circulate among various news organizations and online sources stark a liberal blogger marine veteran and law student attempted to ask allen about his missing arrest records and the reasons for the sealing of his divorce papers after yelling out a question about rumors of allen having assaulted his first wife stark was briefly placed in a headlock restrained slung to the ground and forcibly escorted from the hotel by three allen supporters stark was detained several days later at another rally after an allen supporter claimed stark pushed him to the ground telephone intimidationedit the fbi launched an investigation into alleged attempts to intimidate potential democratic voters in eight counties before the poll by use of telephone calls to suggest that persons with outstanding warrants would be arrested as they voted a classic example of voter suppression
