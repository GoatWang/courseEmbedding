of our retirement savings we didnt know where to turn and thought we would just have to accept that we were left with nothing we saw an article about attorney david meyer and called his office we were not used to dealing with attorneys and didnt know what to expect but mr meyer and his staff were kind and kept us well informed about our rights we were very satisfied with the results they were able to get for us and the short length of time it took to have some of our losses returned having the money reinvested has definitely made life easier for us  awohio i was a business litigation attorney for approximately  years and practiced law with one of largest law firms in the nation i have been involved in many large complex cases and i believe i have a reasonable understanding of how lawyers and law firms should go about their work everything that david p meyer and associates did for me in connection with my securities arbitration claim was done in a first class manner much as i would expect from the best large law firms it has been my pleasure to have dealt with david meyer and i strongly recommend his firm to anyone who has a potential investment misconduct claim  rs esqcalifornia at a time in our life when we thought life would be easier because we had worked hard and carefully planned and saved for our golden years we discovered our stockbroker had lost our entire lifes savings we thought there was no hope of recovering any of it thats when we were referred to david meyer and associates mr meyer and his staff explained the arbitration process and gave us hope thanks to their hard work the arbitration and settlement process put us back on track they were a godsend when we needed them most  swkentucky i accepted an early retirement from my large employer after more than  years based on the recommendation of my stockbroker that i had plenty of money to live on i put every dollar i had into my stockbrokers hand and trusted him and his brokerage firm as the months went by i was losing money at a alarming rate and i soon found out that many of my coworkers were losing their retirement savings with the same brokerage firm i do not remember how i heard about david meyer  associates but they came to be my knight in shining armor hiring mr meyers law firm was probably the smartest thing ive done in my life dozens of my coworkers hired them too it took some time to get through the process but david and his firm did a great job for all of us i can honestly say that i would probably be back to working  hours a week again if not for davids success with our claims theres an old saying you cant take on city hall well david did better than that  he took on this large brokerage firmand won i have nothing but the highest praise for david meyer and his staff of very qualified people  rhohio we had never participated in any type of lawsuit before but after our stockbroker mishandled our investments and nearly lost all of the money it took us over thirty years to save we felt we needed to do something we hired mr meyer and he went to bat for us against the brokerage firm the staff at david meyer and associates communicated with us regularly as they led us through the process of recovering our losses they were always helpful and we felt well served by them not knowing what to expect we were pleased with how fast we were able to obtain a recovery hiring mr meyer to help us recover our losses has made retirement easier for us  jrkentucky i and many of my coworkers retired after  years of employment and rolled over our lumpsum retirement to a national brokerage firm the broker we entrusted with our life savings failed to protect our nest egg and we lost a big portion of our retirement a group of us all hired david meyer  associates to hold the brokerage firm accountable for not investing our retirement properly mr meyer and his firm got a great result for us and we are now able to enjoy our retirement  bhtexas my husband and i hired a financial planner to ensure the safety of our retirement nest egg but he lost most of that money through a series of investments that were inappropriate for people at our stage in life after my husband passed i didnt know where to turn and had even spoken to a local attorney that did not think there was anything i could even do i felt like the situation was my fault for trusting the broker i heard about david meyer  associates and he and his staff let me know what my rights were and that there was hope through the arbitration process they took care of everything and i was surprised at how easy they made it for me to pursue a claim mr meyer and his staff was always professional and responsive to my calls and they really took their time with me to review paperwork and mad sure that i remained well informed throughout the process i feel like mr meyer not only helped me to recover my investment losses but he also helped me to get justice for my late husband

professionalism  l mflorida i trusted my brokerage firm that i have been with for years with money that my father had intended to be invested in safe secure investments to provide for my mothers living expenses after his passing as well as for his family members the brokerage firm recommended an investment that was later found to be invested in securities different than had been represented i was very pleased with the results that meyer and associates were able to obtain for me and my family  jfindiana i was angry when my retirement savings were mismanaged by my stockbroker i knew i had lost most of my hardearned money but i was unsure of what if anything i could do about it my daughterinlaw had heard of mr meyers law firm so i gave them a call they supplied me with the information i needed to know about my rights as an investor and why i had a claim to recover some of my losses from the brokerage firm i was very much impressed with the way they handled my claim and pleased with the result they were able to get for me it was well worth the call  gctennessee i was very pleased with mr meyer’s handing of my arbitration claim throughout the process i felt that i was treated with respect and i always appreciated the extra effort david meyer and his staff put forth to recover the money my stockbroker had lost i never felt my relationship with david was limited to an attorneyclient relationship i always thought it was more like a friend helping another friend they did a tremendous job and when it was over david was able to get back a lot more money for me than i ever expected i have kept the firm’s number handy and would tell anyone that has been a victim of stockbroker misconduct to contact meyer and associates  cfohio we were devastated when our longtime stockbroker inexcusably caused our companys pension plan and profit sharing plans to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in unsuitable investments in just  short years with two different brokerage firms thankfully our accountant had heard of meyer  associates and referred us to mr meyer for help mr meyer understood that our employees were the real victims and he dedicated himself to making the brokerage firms put as much money back into our coffers as possible i urge anyone who thinks they have been wronged by their stockbroker or brokerage firm to seek the advice of meyer  associates  i am so thankful that i did  mfohio our brokerage firm recommended that we mortgage our paidoff home and then convinced us to invest the loan proceeds into unsuitable annuities the results were devastating

made everything feel seamless being my first time to work with a law firm on this type of issue i was constantly surprises at both the competence skills respect thoroughness and the pleasant ease the experience was i highly recommend both the firm and their unusually qualified and helpful people working there  dgsalt lake city ut the case i brought to meyer wilson involved more of an ethical injustice and had many legal hurdles despite this mr chad kohler esq explained thoroughly all aspects of my case advised me using his expertise and guided me through a mediation process resulting in a satisfactory settlement had it not been for the representation of meyer wilson and in particular mr kohler i would have never had a resolution  vb my experience with meyer wilson proved to be a very professional as well as personal interaction chad kohler represented my case with the caring and realistic guidance needed to attain a satisfactory resolution during mediation i appreciate the personal interest and legal expertise he and his staff offered me during a difficult time i was able to make an informed decision and feel that with the help of meyer wilson my case was resolved with
