vermont to lucy mack smith and her husband joseph sr a merchant and farmer after suffering a crippling bone infection when he was seven the younger smith used crutches for three years in – after an illfated business venture and three years of crop failures the smith family moved to the western new york village of palmyra and eventually took a mortgage on a acre  ha farm in the nearby town of manchester during the second great awakening the region was a hotbed of religious enthusiasm and between  and  there were several camp meetings and revivals in the palmyra area although smiths parents disagreed about religion the family was caught up in this excitement smith later said he became interested in religion at about the age of twelve he participated in church classes and read the bible as a teenager he may have been sympathetic to methodism with other family members smith also engaged in religious folk magic not an uncommon practice at the time both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from god smith said that although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations years later smith said that in  he had received a vision that resolved his religious confusion while praying in a wooded area near his home he said that god in a vision had told him his sins were forgiven and that all contemporary churches had turned aside from the gospel smith said he told the experience to a preacher who dismissed the story with contempt but the experience was largely unknown even to most mormons until the s although smith may have understood the event as a personal conversion this first vision later grew in importance among mormons who today see it as the first event in the restoration of the gospel smith said he received golden plates from the angel moroni at the hill cumorah smith said that in  while praying one night for forgiveness from his sins he was visited by an angel named moroni who revealed the location of a buried book made of golden plates as well as other artifacts including a breastplate and a set of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame which had been hidden in a hill in manchester near his home smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning but was unsuccessful because the angel prevented him smith reported that during the next four years he made annual visits to the hill but each time returned without the plates meanwhile the smith family faced financial hardship due in part to the november  death of smiths oldest brother alvin who had assumed a leadership role in the family family members supplemented their meager farm income by hiring out for odd jobs and working as treasure seekers a type of magical supernaturalism common during the period smith was said to have an ability to locate lost items by looking into a seer stone which he also used in treasure hunting including several unsuccessful attempts to find buried treasure sponsored by a wealthy farmer in chenango county new york in  smith was brought before a chenango county court for glasslooking or pretending to find lost treasure the result of the proceeding remains unclear as primary sources report various conflicting outcomes while boarding at the hale house in harmony pennsylvania smith began courting emma hale when smith proposed marriage emmas father isaac hale objected because smith was a stranger who had no means of supporting his daughter other than money digging of which he disapproved smith and emma eloped and married on january   after which the couple began boarding with smiths parents in manchester later that year when smith promised to abandon treasure seeking hale offered to let the couple live on his property in harmony and help smith get started in business smith said that he made his last annual visit to the hill on september   taking emma with him this time he said he retrieved the plates and put them in a locked chest he said the angel commanded him not to show the plates to anyone else but to publish their translation reputed to be the religious record of indigenous americans smith said that the plates were engraved in an unknown language reformed egyptian and he told associates that he was capable of reading and translating them although smith had left his treasure hunting company his former associates believed he had doublecrossed them by taking for himself what they considered joint property after they ransacked places where a competing treasureseer said the plates were hidden smith decided to leave palmyra founding a church –edit main article life of joseph smith from  to  in october  smith and his pregnant wife moved from palmyra to harmony now oakland pennsylvania aided by money from a relatively prosperous neighbor martin harris living near his inlaws smith transcribed some characters that he said were engraved on the plates and then dictated a translation to his wife in february  martin harris arrived to assist smith by transcribing his dictation harris also took a sample of the characters to a few prominent scholars including charles anthon who harris said initially authenticated the characters and their translation but then retracted his opinion after learning that smith was supposed to have received the plates from an angel anthon denied harriss account of the meeting claiming instead that he had tried to convince harris that he had been the victim of a fraud nevertheless harris returned to harmony in april  encouraged to continue as smiths scribe smith continued to dictate to harris until midjune  when harris began having doubts about the project fueled in part by his wifes skepticism harris convinced smith to let him take the existing  pages of manuscript to palmyra to show a few family members including his wife harris lost the manuscript—of which there was no other copy—at about the same time smiths wife emma gave birth to a son alvin who died the same day smith said that as punishment for losing the manuscript the angel took away the plates and revoked his ability to translate during this dark period smith briefly attended methodist meetings with his wife until a cousin of hers objected to inclusion of a practicing necromancer on the methodist class roll cover page of the book of mormon original  edition smith said that the angel returned the plates to him on september   and he resumed dictation in april  after he met oliver cowdery who replaced harris as his scribe they worked full time on the manuscript between april and early june  and then moved to fayette new york where they continued to work at the home of cowderys friend peter whitmer when the narrative described an institutional church and a requirement for baptism smith and cowdery baptized each other dictation was completed around july   although smith had previously refused to show the plates to anyone he told martin harris oliver cowdery and david whitmer that they would be allowed to see them these men known collectively as the three witnesses—along with a later group of eight witnesses composed of male members of the whitmer and smith families—signed statements testifying that they had seen the golden plates statements were issued by both the three witnesses and the eight witnesses the primary distinction between the two groups were that the three witnesses stated that an angel showed them the plates and the voice of god confirmed their truth while the eight witnesses where shown the plates by smith according to smith the angel moroni took back the plates once smith finished using them the completed work the book of mormon was published in palmyra on march   by printer e b grandin martin harris having mortgaged his farm to finance it soon after on april   smith and his followers formally organized the church of christ and small branches were established in palmyra fayette and colesville new york the book of mormon brought smith regional notoriety and opposition from those who remembered his moneydigging and the  chenango county trial after cowdery baptized several new members the mormons received threats of mob violence and before smith could confirm the newly baptized members he was arrested and brought to trial as a disorderly person he was acquitted but both he and cowdery had to flee colesville to escape a gathering mob in probable reference to this period of flight smith said that peter james and john had appeared to him and had ordained him and cowdery to a higher priesthood smiths authority was undermined when oliver cowdery hiram page and other church members also claimed to receive revelations in response smith dictated a revelation which clarified his office as a prophet and an apostle and which declared that only he held the keys of the mysteries and the revelations with the ability to inscribe scripture for the church shortly after the conference smith dispatched cowdery peter whitmer and others on a mission to proselytize native americans cowdery was also assigned the task of locating the site of the new jerusalem on their way to missouri cowderys party passed through northeastern ohio where sidney rigdon and over a hundred followers of his variety of campbellite restorationism converted to mormonism more than doubling the size of the church rigdon soon visited new york and quickly became smiths primary assistant with growing opposition in new york smith gave forth as revelation that kirtland was the eastern boundary of the new jerusalem and that his followers must gather there life in ohio –edit main articles life of joseph smith from  to  and life of joseph smith from  to  when smith moved to kirtland ohio in january  he encountered a religious culture that included enthusiastic demonstrations of spiritual gifts including fits and trances rolling on the ground and speaking in tongues smith tamed these outbursts by producing two revelations that brought the kirtland congregation under his own authority rigdons followers had also been practicing a form of communalism and this smith adopted calling it the united order smith had promised church elders that in kirtland they would receive an endowment of heavenly power and at the june  general conference he introduced the greater authority of a high melchizedek priesthood to the church hierarchy a mob tarred and feathered smith in  converts poured into kirtland by the summer of  there were fifteen hundred to two thousand mormons in the vicinity many expecting smith to lead them shortly to the millennial kingdom though the mission to the indians had been a failure the missionaries sent on their way by a government indian agent cowdery reported that he had found the site of the new jerusalem in jackson county missouri after smith visited in july  he agreed pronouncing the frontier hamlet of independence the center place of zion nevertheless rigdon disapproved and for most of the s the church remained divided between ohio and missouri smith continued to live in ohio but visited missouri again in early  in order to prevent a rebellion of prominent church members including cowdery who believed the church in missouri was being neglected smiths trip was hastened by a mob of ohio residents who were incensed over the united order and smiths political power the mob beat smith and rigdon unconscious tarred and feathered them and left them for dead in jackson county missouri residents resented the mormon newcomers for both political and religious reasons tension increased until july  when nonmormons forcibly evicted the mormons and destroyed their property smith advised them to bear the violence patiently until they were attacked a fourth time after which they could fight back after armed bands exchanged fire and one mormon and two nonmormons were killed the old settlers brutally expelled the mormons from the county smith ended the communitarian experiment and changed the name of the church to the church of latter day saints before leading a small paramilitary expedition later called zions camp to aid the missouri mormons as a military endeavor the expedition was a failure the men were outnumbered and suffered from dissension and a cholera outbreak nevertheless zions camp transformed mormon leadership and many future church leaders came from among the participants after the camp returned smith drew heavily from its participants to establish five governing bodies in the church all originally of equal authority to check one another among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles smith gave a revelation saying that to redeem zion his followers would have to receive an endowment in the kirtland temple and in march  at the temples dedication many participants in the promised endowment saw visions of angels spoke in tongues and prophesied smith dedicated the kirtland temple in  in late  a series of internal disputes led to the collapse of the kirtland mormon community smith was blamed for having promoted a churchsponsored bank that failed and accused of engaging in a sexual relationship with his serving girl fanny alger building the temple had left the church deeply in debt and smith was hounded by creditors having heard of a large sum of money supposedly hidden in salem massachusetts smith traveled there and received a revelation that god had much treasure in this city but after a month he returned to kirtland emptyhanded in january  smith and other church leaders created a joint stock company called the kirtland safety society to act as a quasibank the company issued bank notes capitalized in part by real estate smith encouraged the latter day saints to buy the notes and he invested heavily in them himself but the bank failed within a month as a result the latter day saints in kirtland suffered intense pressure from debt collectors and severe price volatility smith was held responsible for the failure and there were widespread defections from the church including many of smiths closest advisers after a warrant was issued for smiths arrest on a charge of banking fraud smith and rigdon fled kirtland for missouri on the night of january   life in missouri –edit main

thousands of latter day saints followed them from kirtland smith encouraged the settlement of land outside caldwell county instituting a settlement in adamondiahman in daviess county during this time a church council expelled many of the oldest and most prominent leaders of the church including john whitmer david whitmer w w phelps and oliver cowdery smith explicitly approved of the expulsion of these men who were known collectively as the dissenters political and religious differences between old missourians and newlyarriving mormon settlers provoked tensions between the two groups much as they had years earlier in jackson county by this time smiths experiences with mob violence led him to believe that his faiths survival required greater militancy against antimormons around june  recent convert sampson avard formed a covert organization called the danites to intimidate mormon dissenters and oppose antimormon militia units though it is unclear how much smith knew of the danites activities he clearly approved of those of which he did know after rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had no place in the mormon community the danites forcibly expelled them from the county in an oration given at the towns fourth of july celebration rigdon declared that mormons would no longer tolerate persecution by the missourians and spoke of a war of extermination if mormons were attacked smith implicitly endorsed this speech and many nonmormons understood it to be a thinlyveiled threat they unleashed a flood of antimormon rhetoric in newspapers and in stump speeches given during the  election campaign on august   nonmormons in gallatin tried to prevent mormons from voting and the electionday scuffles initiated the  mormon war nonmormon vigilantes raided and burned mormon farms and danites and other mormons pillaged nonmormon towns during this period smiths heated rhetoric encouraged some of his followers to take aggressive measures smith himself might not have approved under the impression that an approaching group of armed men were a band of vigilantes mormons attacked the missouri state militia in what became known as the battle of crooked river governor lilburn boggs then ordered that the mormons be exterminated or driven from the state even though they were yet unaware of boggss order on october  a party of missourians surprised and killed seventeen mormons in the hauns mill massacre smith was held for four months in liberty jail the following day the latter day saints surrendered to  state troops and agreed to forfeit their property and leave the state smith was immediately brought before a military court accused of treason and sentenced to be executed the next morning but alexander doniphan smiths former attorney and a brigadier general in the missouri militia refused to carry out the order smith was then sent to a state court for a preliminary hearing where several of his former allies testified against him smith and five others including rigdon were charged with overt acts of treason and transferred to the jail at liberty missouri to await trial smiths months in prison with an ill and whining rigdon strained their relationship meanwhile brigham young thenpresident of the quorum of the twelve apostles rose to prominence among the mormon faithful when he organized the move of about  saints to illinois and eastern iowa smith bore his imprisonment stoically understanding that he was effectively on trial before his own people many of whom considered him a fallen prophet he wrote a personal defense and an apology for the activities of the danites the keys of the kingdom he wrote have not been taken away from us though he directed his followers to collect and publish their stories of persecution he also urged them to moderate their antagonism toward nonmormons on april   after a grand jury hearing in davis county smith and his companions escaped custody almost certainly with the connivance of the sheriff

saints and illinois accepted mormon refugees who gathered along the banks of the mississippi river where smith purchased highpriced swampy woodland in the hamlet of commerce smith also attempted to portray the latter day saints as an oppressed minority and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government for help in obtaining reparations during the summer of  while latter day saints in nauvoo suffered from a malaria epidemic smith sent brigham young and other apostles to missions in europe where they made numerous converts many of them poor factory workers depiction of smith at head of the nauvoo legion smith also attracted a few wealthy and influential converts including john c bennett the illinois quartermaster general bennett used his connections in the illinois legislature to obtain an unusually liberal charter for the new city which smith named nauvoo hebrew נָאווּ meaning to be beautiful the charter granted the city virtual autonomy authorized a university and granted nauvoo habeas corpus power—which allowed smith to fend off extradition to missouri though mormon authorities controlled nauvoos civil government the city promised an unusually liberal guarantee of religious freedom the charter also authorized the nauvoo legion an autonomous militia whose actions were limited only by state and federal constitutions lieutenant general smith and major general bennett became its commanders thereby controlling by far the largest body of armed men in illinois smith made bennett assistant president of the church and bennett was elected nauvoos first mayor in  smith began revealing the doctrine of plural marriage to a few of his closest male associates including bennett who used it as an excuse to seduce numerous women wed and unwed when embarrassing rumors of spiritual wifery got abroad smith forced bennetts resignation as nauvoo mayor in retaliation bennett wrote lurid exposés of life in nauvoo smith planned the construction of the nauvoo temple which was completed after his death the early nauvoo years were a period of doctrinal innovation smith introduced baptism for the dead in  and in  construction began on the nauvoo temple as a place for recovering lost ancient knowledge an  revelation promised the restoration of the fulness of the priesthood and in may  smith inaugurated a revised endowment or first anointing the endowment resembled rites of freemasonry that smith had observed two months earlier when he had been initiated into the nauvoo masonic lodge at first the endowment was open only to men who were initiated into the anointed quorum for women smith introduced the relief society a service club and sorority within which smith predicted women would receive the keys of the kingdom smith also elaborated on his plan for a millennial kingdom no longer envisioning the building of zion in nauvoo smith viewed zion as encompassing all of north and south america with mormon settlements being stakes of zions metaphorical tent zion also became less a refuge from an impending tribulation than a great building project in the summer of  smith revealed a plan to establish the millennial kingdom of god which would eventually establish theocratic rule over the whole earth by mid popular opinion had turned against the mormons after an unknown assailant shot and wounded missouri governor lilburn boggs in may  antimormons circulated rumors that smiths bodyguard porter rockwell was the shooter though the evidence was circumstantial boggs ordered smiths extradition certain he would be killed if he ever returned to missouri smith went into hiding twice during the next five months before the us district attorney for illinois argued that smiths extradition to missouri would be unconstitutional rockwell was later tried and acquitted in june  enemies of smith convinced a reluctant illinois governor thomas ford to extradite smith to missouri on the old charge of treason two law officers arrested smith but were intercepted by a party of mormons before they could reach missouri smith was then released on a writ of habeas corpus from the nauvoo municipal court while this ended the missourians attempts at extradition it caused significant political fallout in illinois in december  smith petitioned congress to make nauvoo an independent territory with the right to call out federal troops in its defense smith then wrote to the leading presidential candidates and asked them what they would do to protect the mormons after receiving noncommittal or negative responses smith announced his own thirdparty candidacy for president of the united states suspended regular proselytizing and sent out the quorum of the twelve and hundreds of other political missionaries in march  following a dispute with a federal bureaucrat smith organized the secret council of fifty with authority to decide which national or state laws mormons should obey the council was also to select a site for a large mormon

nauvoo legion disagreed with smith about how to manage nauvoos economy both also said that smith had proposed marriage to their wives believing the dissidents were plotting against his life smith excommunicated them on april   these dissidents formed a competing church and the following month at carthage the county seat they procured indictments against smith for perjury and polygamy on june  the dissidents published the first and only issue of the nauvoo expositor calling for reform within the church and appealing to the political views of the countys antimormons the paper decried smiths new doctrines of many gods alluded to smiths theocratic aspirations and called for a repeal of the nauvoo city charter it also attacked smiths practice of polygamy implying that smith was using religion as a pretext to draw unassuming women to nauvoo in order to seduce and marry them fearing the newspaper would bring the countryside down on the mormons the nauvoo city council declared the expositor a public nuisance and ordered the nauvoo legion to destroy the press smith who feared another mob attack supported the action not realizing that destroying a newspaper was more likely to incite an attack than any libel smith was shot multiple times before and after falling from the window destruction of the newspaper provoked a strident call to arms from thomas c sharp editor of the warsaw signal and longtime critic of smith fearing an uprising smith mobilized the nauvoo legion on june  and declared martial law officials in carthage responded by mobilizing their small detachment of the state militia and governor thomas ford appeared threatening to raise a larger militia unless smith and the nauvoo city council surrendered themselves smith initially fled across the mississippi river but shortly returned and surrendered to ford on june  smith and his brother hyrum rode to carthage to stand trial for inciting a riot once the smiths were in custody the charges were increased

falling out the window crying oh lord my god he died shortly after hitting the ground but was shot several times more before the mob dispersed five men were later tried for his murder but all were acquitted smith was buried in nauvoo and is interred there at the smith family cemetery throughout his life smith had been sharply criticized by newspaper editors and after his death newspapers were almost unanimous in portraying smith as a religious fanatic conversely within mormonism smith was memorialized first and foremost as a prophet martyred to seal the testimony of his faith legacyedit impactedit smith attracted thousands of devoted followers before his death in  and millions in the century that followed among mormons he is regarded as a prophet on par with moses and elijah in a  compilation of the  most significant americans of all time smithsonian magazine ranked smith first in the category of religious figures mormons and exmormons have produced a large amount of scholarly work about smith and to a large extent the result has been two discordant pictures of very different people a man of god on the one hand and on the other a fraud preying on the ignorance of his followers believers tended to focus on his achievements and religious teachings deemphasizing his personal defects while detractors focused on his mistakes legal troubles and controversial doctrines during the first half of the th century some writers suggested that smith might have suffered from epileptic seizures or from psychological disorders such as paranoid delusions or manicdepressive illness that might explain his visions and revelations many modern biographers disagree with these ideas more nuanced interpretations range from viewing smith as a prophet who had normal human weaknesses a pious fraud who believed he was called of god to preach repentance and felt justified inventing visions in order to convert people or a gifted mythmaker who was the product of his yankee environment biographers mormon and nonmormon agree that smith was one of the most influential charismatic and innovative figures in american religious history buildings named in honor of smith the

hyrum had he survived would have had the strongest claim followed by smiths brother samuel who died mysteriously a month after his brothers another brother william was unable to attract a sufficient following smiths sons joseph iii and david also had claims but joseph iii was too young and david was yet unborn the council of fifty had a theoretical claim to succession but it was a secret organization some of smiths chosen successors such as oliver cowdery and david whitmer had left the church the two strongest succession candidates were brigham young senior member and president of the quorum of the twelve apostles and sidney rigdon the senior member of the first presidency in a churchwide conference on august  most of the latter day saints elected young who led them to the utah

based his claim on an allegedlyforged letter of appointment others followed lyman wight and alpheus cutler many members of these smaller groups including most of smiths family eventually coalesced in

thousand female signatures denying that smith was connected with polygamy as president of the ladies relief society emma authorized publishing a certificate in the same year denouncing polygamy and

from brigham young and the church leadership young whom emma feared and despised was suspicious of her desire to preserve the familys assets from inclusion with those of the church and thought she

belief in the authenticity of the book of mormon revelationsedit an artistic representation of the golden plates with the urim and thummim connected to a breastplate based on descriptions by smith and others according to richard bushman the signal feature of smiths life was his sense of being guided by revelation instead of presenting ideas with logical arguments smith dictated authoritative revelations and let people decide whether to believe smiths teachings came primarily through his revelations which read like scripture oracular and open to interpretation smith and his followers viewed his revelations as being above teachings or opinions and smiths actions seemed to indicate that he believed in his revelations as much as his most loyal followers smiths first recorded revelation was a rebuke from god for having let martin harris lose  pages of book of mormon manuscript chastising him for fearing man more than god the revelation was given in the voice of god rather than as a declaration mediated through smith and subsequent revelations assumed a similar authoritative style often opening with words such as hearken o ye people which profess my name saith the lord your god book of mormonedit main article book of mormon the book of mormon has been called the longest and most complex of smiths revelations it is organized as a compilation of smaller books each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader it tells the story of the rise and fall of a religious civilization beginning around  bc and ending in  ad the story begins with a family that leaves jerusalem just before the babylonian captivity they eventually construct a ship and sail to a promised land in the western hemisphere there they are divided into two factions nephites and lamanites the nephites become a righteous people who build a temple and live the law of moses though their prophets teach a christian gospel the book explains itself to be largely the work of mormon a nephite prophet and military figure the book closes when mormons son moroni finishes engraving and buries the records written on the golden plates christian themes permeate the work for instance nephite prophets in the book of mormon teach of christs coming and talk of the star that will appear at his birth after the crucifixion and resurrection in jerusalem jesus appears in the americas repeats the sermon on the mount blesses children and appoints twelve disciples the book ends with moronis exhortation to come unto christ early mormons understood the book of mormon to be a religious history of the indigenous peoples of the americas smiths followers view it as a companion to the bible and an additional witness of christ akin to a large apocryphal work modern historian fawn brodie has called the book of mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of smiths times saying that smith composed the book of mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him dan vogel another historian says that the work is autobiographical in nature according to some accounts smith dictated most of the book of mormon by looking into a seer stone placed in a stovepipe hat smith never said how he produced the book of mormon saying only that he translated by the power of god and implying that he had transcribed the words the book of mormon itself states only that its text will come forth by the gift and power of god unto the interpretation thereof as such considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists for at least some of the earliest dictation smith is said to have used the urim and thummim a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates later however he is said to have used a chocolatecolored stone he had found in  that he had used previously for treasure hunting joseph knight said that smith saw the words of the translation while he gazed at the stone or stones in the bottom of his hat excluding all light a process similar to divining the location of treasure sometimes smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table after completing the translation smith gave the brown stone to cowdery but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about  when he said he no longer needed it although the book of mormon drew many converts to the church fawn brodie argued in  that the book lives today because of the prophet not he because of the book smith had assumed a role as prophet seer and apostle of jesus christ and by early  he was introducing himself as joseph the prophet the language of authority in smiths revelations was appealing to converts and the revelations were given with the confidence of an old testament prophet moses and abrahamedit main articles book of abraham and book of moses smith said that in june  he received a revelation of moses in which moses saw the world and the ends thereof and asked god questions about the purpose of creation and mans relationship to god this revelation initiated a revision of the bible on which smith worked sporadically until  and which remained unpublished at his death smith said that he believed the bible had been corrupted through the ages and that his revision worked to restore the original intent it added long passages rewritten according to his inspiration while many changes involved straightening out seeming contradictions or making small clarifications other changes added large lost portions to the text for instance smiths revision nearly tripled the length of the first five chapters of genesis in what would become the book of moses the book of moses begins with moses inquiring of god as to the purpose of creation and is told in this account that god made the earth and heavens to bring humans to eternal life the book also provides an enlarged account of the genesis creation narrative and expands the story of enoch the ancestor of noah in the narrative enoch speaks with god receives a prophetic calling and eventually builds a city of zion so righteous that it was taken to heaven the book also elaborates and expands upon foreshadowing and types of christ in effect christianizing the old testament in  smith encouraged some latter day saints in kirtland to purchase rolls of ancient egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor over the next several years smith worked off and on as events allowed to produce a supposed translation of one of these rolls which he published in  as the book of abraham the book of abraham speaks of the founding of the abrahamic nation astronomy cosmology lineage and priesthood and gave another account of the creation story the papyri from which smith dictated the book of abraham were thought to have been lost in the great chicago fire but several fragments were rediscovered in the s were translated by egyptologists and were determined to be part of the book of the dead with no connection to abraham other revelationsedit see also book of commandments and doctrine and covenants the holy spirit may give you sudden strokes of ideas so

smith dictated revelations orally and they were recorded by a scribe without revisions or corrections revelations were immediately copied and then circulated among church members smiths revelations often came in response to specific questions he described the revelatory process as having pure intelligence flowing into him smith however never viewed the wording to be infallible the revelations were not gods words verbatim but couched in language suitable to josephs time in  smith edited and expanded many of the previous revelations publishing them as the book of commandments which later became part of the doctrine and covenants smith gave varying types of revelations some were temporal while others were spiritual or doctrinal some were received for a specific individual while others were directed at the whole church notable revelations include an  revelation called the law containing directions for missionary work rules for organizing society in zion a reiteration of the ten commandments an injunction to administer to the poor and needy and an outline for the law of consecration an  revelation called the vision added to the fundamentals of sin and atonement introduced doctrines of life after salvation the theme of exaltation and a heaven with degrees of glory another  revelation on priesthood was the first to explain priesthood doctrine three months later smith gave a lengthy revelation called the olive leaf containing themes of cosmology and eschatology and discussing subjects such as light truth intelligence and sanctification a related revelation given in  put christ at the center of salvation also in  at a time of temperance agitation smith delivered a revelation called the word of wisdom which counseled a diet of wholesome herbs fruits grains a sparing use of meat and recommended that latter day saints avoid strong alcoholic drinks tobacco and hot drinks later interpreted to mean tea and coffee the word of wisdom was not originally framed as a commandment but a recommendation as such smith and other latter day saints did not strictly follow this counsel though it later became a requirement in the lds church in  smith gave the great revelation that organized the priesthood into quorums and councils and served as a complex blueprint for church structure smiths last revelation on the new and everlasting covenant was recorded in  and dealt with the theology of family the doctrine of sealing and plural marriage before  most of smiths revelations dealt with establishing the church gathering his followers and building the city of zion while later revelations dealt with the priesthood endowment and exaltation the revelations slowed in kirtland during the autumn of  and again after the dedication of the kirtland temple as smith relied more heavily on his own teachings smith moved away from written revelations opening with verily thus saith the lord and taught more in sermons conversations and letters for instance the doctrines of baptism for the dead and the nature of god were introduced in sermons and one of smiths most famed statements about there being no such thing as immaterial matter was recorded from a casual conversation with a methodist preacher views and teachingsedit main article teachings of joseph smith smiths later theology described jesus and god the father as two distinct physical beings cosmology and theologyedit see also mormon cosmology and godhead latter day saints smith taught that all existence was material including a world of spirit matter so fine that it was invisible to all but the purest mortal eyes matter in smiths view could neither be created nor destroyed the creation involved only the reorganization of existing matter like matter smith saw intelligence as coeternal with god and taught that human spirits had been drawn from a preexistent pool of eternal intelligences nevertheless spirits could not experience a fullness of joy unless joined with corporeal bodies according to smith the work and glory of god then was to create worlds across the cosmos where inferior intelligences could be embodied though smith initially viewed god the father as a spirit he eventually began teaching that god was an advanced and glorified man embodied within time and space by the end of his life smith was teaching that both god the father and jesus were distinct beings with physical bodies but the holy spirit was a personage of spirit through the gradual acquisition of knowledge according to smith those who received exaltation could eventually become like god these teachings implied a vast hierarchy of gods with god himself having a father in smiths cosmology those who became gods would reign unified in purpose and will leading spirits of lesser capacity to share immortality and eternal life in smiths view the opportunity to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation apart from those who committed the eternal sin smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife religious authority and ritualedit see also priesthood latter day saints freemasonry and the latter day saint movement and endowment latter day saints smiths teachings were rooted in dispensational restorationism he taught that the church of christ restored through him was a latterday restoration of the early christian faith which had been lost in the great apostasy at first smiths church had little sense of hierarchy his religious authority was derived from visions and revelations though smith did not claim exclusive prophethood an early revelation designated him as the only prophet allowed to issue commandments as moses this religious authority encompassed economic and political as well as spiritual matters for instance in the early s he temporarily instituted a form of religious communism called the united order that required latter day saints to give all their property to the church which was divided among the faithful he also envisioned that the theocratic institutions he established would have a role in the worldwide political organization of the millennium by the mids smith began teaching a hierarchy of three priesthoods—the melchizedek the aaronic and the patriarchal each priesthood was a continuation of biblical priesthoods through patrilineal succession or ordination by biblical figures appearing in visions upon introducing the melchizedek or high priesthood in  smith taught that its recipients would be endowed with power from on high thus fulfilling a need for a greater holiness and an authority commensurate with the new testament apostles this doctrine of endowment evolved through the s until in  the nauvoo endowment included an elaborate ceremony containing elements similar to freemasonry and the jewish tradition of kabbalah the endowment was extended to women in  though smith never clarified whether women could be ordained to priesthood offices smith taught that the high priesthoods endowment of heavenly power included the sealing powers of elijah allowing high priests to effect binding consequences in the afterlife for example this power would enable proxy baptisms for the dead and priesthood marriages that would be effective into the afterlife elijahs sealing powers also enabled the second anointing or fulness sic of the priesthood which according to smith sealed married couples to their exaltation theology of familyedit during the early s smith unfolded a theology of family relations called the new and everlasting covenant that superseded all earthly bonds he taught that outside the covenant marriages were simply matters of contract and that in the afterlife individuals married outside the covenant or not married would be limited in their progression to fully enter the covenant a man and woman must participate in a first anointing a sealing ceremony and a second anointing also called sealing by the holy spirit of promise when fully sealed into the covenant smith said that no sin nor blasphemy other than the eternal sin could keep them from their exaltation in the afterlife according to smith only one person on earth at a time—in this case smith—could possess this power of sealing a painting of smith by bathsheba w smith created circa  smith taught that the highest level of exaltation could be achieved through plural marriage polygamy which was the ultimate manifestation of this new and everlasting covenant plural marriage according to smith allowed an individual to transcend the angelic state and become a god accelerating the expansion of ones heavenly kingdom polygamyedit see also origin of latter day saint polygamy and mormonism and polygamy smith had by some accounts been teaching a polygamy doctrine as early as  and there is unconfirmed evidence that smith was a polygamist by  although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy in  there was a rift between smith and oliver cowdery over the issue cowdery suspected smith had engaged in a relationship with his serving girl fanny alger smith never denied a relationship but insisted it was not adulterous presumably because he had taken alger as a plural wife in april  smith wed louisa beaman during the next twoandahalf years he married or was sealed to about  additional women ten of whom were already married to other men some of these polyandrous marriages were done with the consent of the first husbands and some plural marriages may have been considered eternityonly sealings ten of smiths plural wives were between the ages of fourteen and twenty others were over fifty the practice of polygamy was kept secret from both nonmormons and most members of the church during smiths lifetime polygamy caused a breach between smith and his first wife emma although emma knew of some of her husbands marriages she almost certainly did not know the extent of his polygamous activities in  emma temporarily accepted smiths marriage to four women boarded in the smith household but soon regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave in july  smith dictated a revelation directing emma to accept plural marriage but the two were not reconciled until september  after emma began participating in temple ceremonies political viewsedit the neutrality

message while campaigning for president of the united states in  smith had opportunity to take political positions on issues of the day smith considered the us constitution and especially the bill of rights to be inspired by god and the latter day saints best and perhaps only defense he believed a strong central government was crucial to the nations wellbeing and thought democracy better than tyranny—although he also taught that a theocratic monarchy was the ideal form of government in foreign affairs smith was an expansionist though he viewed expansionism as brotherhood smith favored a strong central bank and high tariffs to protect american business and agriculture he disfavored imprisonment of convicts except for murder preferring efforts to reform criminals through labor he also opposed courtsmartial for military deserters he supported capital punishment but opposed hanging preferring execution by firing squad or beheading on the issue of slavery smith took different positions initially he opposed it but during the mids when the mormons were settling in missouri a slave state smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly antiabolitionist essay then in the early s after mormons had been expelled from missouri he once again opposed slavery during his presidential campaign of  he proposed ending slavery by  and compensating slaveholders for their loss smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites and he welcomed slaves into the church however he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters and he opposed interracial marriage smith declared that he would be one of the instruments in fulfilling nebuchadnezzars statue vision in the book of daniel that secular government would be destroyed without sword or gun and would be replaced with a theodemocratic kingdom of god smith taught that this kingdom would be governed by theocratic principles but that it would also be multidenominational and democratic so long as the people chose wisely ethics and behavioredit a succinct statement of ethics by smith is found in his th article of faith we believe in being honest true chaste benevolent virtuous and in doing good to all men indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of paul—we believe all things we hope all things we have endured many things and hope to be able to endure all things if there is anything virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy we seek after these things smith said his ethical rule was when the lord commands do it he also taught that which is wrong under one circumstance may be and often is right under another god said thou shalt not kill—at another time he said thou shalt utterly destroy this is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted—by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the elders of the kingdom are placed whatever god requires is right  even things which may be considered abominable to all those who do not understand the order of heaven beginning in the mids and into the s as the mormon people became involved in conflicts with the missouri and illinois state governments smith taught that congress has no power to make a law that would abridge the rights of my religion and that they were not under the obligation to follow laws they deemed as being contrary to their religious privilege smith may have thus felt justified in

founded a religious culture that continues to the present smith was born in sharon vermont by  he had moved with his family to what became known as the burnedover district of western new york an area of intense religious revivalism during the second great awakening according to smith he experienced a series of visions including one in which he saw two personages presumably god the father and jesus christ and others in which an angel directed him to a buried book of golden plates inscribed with a judeochristian history of an ancient american civilization in  smith published what he said was an english translation of these plates the book of mormon the same year he organized the church of christ calling it a restoration of the early christian church members of the church were later called latter day saints or mormons and in  smith announced a revelation that renamed the church as the church of jesus christ of latter day saints in  smith and his followers moved west planning to build a communalistic american zion they first gathered in kirtland ohio and established an outpost in independence missouri which was intended to be zions center place during the s smith sent out missionaries published revelations and supervised construction of the expensive kirtland temple the collapse of the churchsponsored kirtland safety society and violent skirmishes with nonmormon missourians caused smith and his followers to establish a new settlement at nauvoo illinois where he became a spiritual and political leader in  smith and the nauvoo city council angered nonmormons by destroying a newspaper that had criticized smiths power and practice of polygamy after smith was imprisoned in carthage illinois he was killed when a mob stormed the jailhouse smith published many revelations and other texts that his followers regard as scripture his teachings include unique views about the nature of god cosmology family structures political organization and religious

jr was born on december   in sharon vermont to lucy mack smith and her husband joseph sr a merchant and farmer after suffering a crippling bone infection when he was seven the younger smith used crutches for three years in – after an illfated business venture and three years of crop failures the smith family moved to the western new york village of palmyra and eventually took a mortgage on a acre  ha farm in the nearby town of manchester during the second great awakening the region was a hotbed of religious enthusiasm and between  and  there were several camp meetings and revivals in the palmyra area although smiths parents disagreed about religion the family was caught up in this excitement smith later said he became interested in religion at about the age of twelve he participated in church classes and read the bible as a teenager he may have been sympathetic to methodism with other family members smith also engaged in religious folk magic not an uncommon practice at the time both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from god smith said that although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations years later smith said that in  he had received a vision that resolved his religious confusion while praying in a wooded area near his home he said that god in a vision had told him his sins were forgiven and that all contemporary churches had turned aside from the gospel smith said he told the experience to a preacher who dismissed the story with contempt but the experience was largely unknown even to most mormons until the s although smith may have understood the event as a personal conversion this first vision later grew in importance among mormons who today see it as the first event in the restoration of the gospel smith said he received golden plates from the angel moroni at the hill cumorah smith said that in  while praying one night for forgiveness from his sins he was visited by an angel named moroni who revealed the location of a buried book made of golden plates as well as other artifacts including a breastplate and a set of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame which had been hidden in a hill in manchester near his home smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning but was unsuccessful because the angel prevented him smith reported that during the next four years he made annual visits to the hill but each time returned without the plates meanwhile the smith family faced financial hardship due in part to the november  death of smiths oldest brother alvin who had assumed a leadership role in the family family members supplemented their meager farm income by hiring out for odd jobs and working as treasure seekers a type of magical supernaturalism common during the period smith was said to have an ability to locate lost items by looking into a seer stone which he also used in treasure hunting including several unsuccessful attempts to find buried treasure sponsored by a wealthy farmer in chenango county new york in  smith was brought before a chenango county court for glasslooking or pretending to find lost treasure the result of the proceeding remains unclear as primary sources report various conflicting outcomes while boarding at the hale house in harmony pennsylvania smith began courting emma hale when smith proposed marriage emmas father isaac hale objected because smith was a stranger who had no means of supporting his daughter other than money digging of which he disapproved smith and emma eloped and married on january   after which the couple began boarding with smiths parents in manchester later that year when smith promised to abandon treasure seeking hale offered to let the couple live on his property in harmony and help smith get started in business smith said that he made his last annual visit to the hill on september   taking emma with him this time he said he retrieved the plates and put them in a locked chest he said the angel commanded him not to show the plates to anyone else but to publish their translation reputed to be the religious record of indigenous americans smith said that the plates were engraved in an unknown language reformed egyptian and he told associates that he was capable of reading and translating them although smith had left his treasure hunting company his former associates believed he had doublecrossed them by taking for himself what they considered joint property after they ransacked places where a competing treasureseer said the plates were hidden smith decided to leave palmyra founding a church –edit main article life of joseph smith from  to  in october  smith and his pregnant wife moved from palmyra to harmony now oakland pennsylvania aided by money from a relatively prosperous neighbor martin harris living near his inlaws smith transcribed some characters that he said were engraved on the plates and then dictated a translation to his wife in february  martin harris arrived to assist smith by transcribing his dictation harris also took a sample of the characters to a few prominent scholars including charles anthon who harris said initially authenticated the characters and their translation but then retracted his opinion after learning that smith was supposed to have received the plates from an angel anthon denied harriss account of the meeting claiming instead that he had tried to convince harris that he had been the victim of a fraud nevertheless harris returned to harmony in april  encouraged to continue as smiths scribe smith continued to dictate to harris until midjune  when harris began having doubts about the project fueled in part by his wifes skepticism harris convinced smith to let him take the existing  pages of manuscript to palmyra to show a few family members including his wife harris lost the manuscript—of which there was no other copy—at about the same time smiths wife emma gave birth to a son alvin who died the same day smith said that as punishment for losing the manuscript the angel took away the plates and revoked his ability to translate during this dark period smith briefly attended methodist meetings with his wife until a cousin of hers objected to inclusion of a practicing necromancer on the methodist class roll cover page of the book of mormon original  edition smith said that the angel returned the plates to him on september   and he resumed dictation in april  after he met oliver cowdery who replaced harris as his scribe they worked full time on the manuscript between april and early june  and then moved to fayette new york where they continued to work at the home of cowderys friend peter whitmer when the narrative described an institutional church and a requirement for baptism smith and cowdery baptized each other dictation was completed around july   although smith had previously refused to show the plates to anyone he told martin harris oliver cowdery and david whitmer that they would be allowed to see them these men known collectively as the three witnesses—along with a later group of eight witnesses composed of male members of the whitmer and smith families—signed statements testifying that they had seen the golden plates statements were issued by both the three witnesses and the eight witnesses the primary distinction between the two groups were that the three witnesses stated that an angel showed them the plates and the voice of god confirmed their truth while the eight witnesses where shown the plates by smith according to smith the angel moroni took back the plates once smith finished using them the completed work the book of mormon was published in palmyra on march   by printer e b grandin martin harris having mortgaged his farm to finance it soon after on april   smith and his followers formally organized the church of christ and small branches were established in palmyra fayette and colesville new york the book of mormon brought smith regional notoriety and opposition from those who remembered his moneydigging and the  chenango county trial after cowdery baptized several new members the mormons received threats of mob violence and before smith could confirm the newly baptized members he was arrested and brought to trial as a disorderly person he was acquitted but both he and cowdery had to flee colesville to escape a gathering mob in probable reference to this period of flight smith said that peter james and john had appeared to him and had ordained him and cowdery to a higher priesthood smiths authority was undermined when oliver cowdery hiram page and other church members also claimed to receive revelations in response smith dictated a revelation which clarified his office as a prophet and an apostle and which declared that only he held the keys of the mysteries and the revelations with the ability to inscribe scripture for the church shortly after the conference smith dispatched cowdery peter whitmer and others on a mission to proselytize native americans cowdery was also assigned the task of locating the site of the new jerusalem on their way to missouri cowderys party passed through northeastern ohio where sidney rigdon and over a hundred followers of his variety of campbellite restorationism converted to mormonism more than doubling the size of the church rigdon soon visited new york and quickly became smiths primary assistant with growing opposition in new york smith gave forth as revelation that kirtland was the eastern boundary of the new jerusalem and that his followers must gather there life in ohio –edit main articles life of joseph smith from  to  and life of joseph smith from  to  when smith moved to kirtland ohio in january  he encountered a religious culture that included enthusiastic demonstrations of spiritual gifts including fits and trances rolling on the ground and speaking in tongues smith tamed these outbursts by producing two revelations that brought the kirtland congregation under his own authority rigdons followers had also been practicing a form of communalism and this smith adopted calling it the united order smith had promised church elders that in kirtland they would receive an endowment of heavenly power and at the june  general conference he introduced the greater authority of a high melchizedek priesthood to the church hierarchy a mob tarred and feathered smith in  converts poured into kirtland by the summer of  there were fifteen hundred to two thousand mormons in the vicinity many expecting smith to lead them shortly to the millennial kingdom though the mission to the indians had been a failure the missionaries sent on their way by a government indian agent cowdery reported that he had found the site of the new jerusalem in jackson county missouri after smith visited in july  he agreed pronouncing the frontier hamlet of independence the center place of zion nevertheless rigdon disapproved and for most of the s the church remained divided between ohio and missouri smith continued to live in ohio but visited missouri again in early  in order to prevent a rebellion of prominent church members including cowdery who believed the church in missouri was being neglected smiths trip was hastened by a mob of ohio residents who were incensed over the united order and smiths political power the mob beat smith and rigdon unconscious tarred and feathered them and left them for dead in jackson county missouri residents resented the mormon newcomers for both political and religious reasons tension increased until july  when nonmormons forcibly evicted the mormons and destroyed their property smith advised them to bear the violence patiently until they were attacked a fourth time after which they could fight back after armed bands exchanged fire and one mormon and two nonmormons were killed the old settlers brutally expelled the mormons from the county smith ended the communitarian experiment and changed the name of the church to the church of latter day saints before leading a small paramilitary expedition later called zions camp to aid the missouri mormons as a military endeavor the expedition was a failure the men were outnumbered and suffered from dissension and a cholera outbreak nevertheless zions camp transformed mormon leadership and many future church leaders came from among the participants after the camp returned smith drew heavily from its participants to establish five governing bodies in the church all originally of equal authority to check one another among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles smith gave a revelation saying that to redeem zion his followers would have to receive an endowment in the kirtland temple and in march  at the temples dedication many participants in the promised endowment saw visions of angels spoke in tongues and prophesied smith dedicated the kirtland temple in  in late  a series of internal disputes led to the collapse of the kirtland mormon community smith was blamed for having promoted a churchsponsored bank that failed and accused of engaging in a sexual relationship with his serving girl fanny alger building the temple had left the church deeply in debt and smith was hounded by creditors having heard of a large sum of money supposedly hidden in salem massachusetts smith traveled there and received a revelation that god had much treasure in this city but after a month he returned to kirtland emptyhanded in january  smith and other church leaders created a joint stock company called the kirtland safety society to act as a quasibank the company issued bank notes capitalized in part by real estate smith encouraged the latter day saints to buy the notes and he invested heavily in them himself but the bank failed within a month as a result the latter day saints in kirtland suffered intense pressure from debt collectors and severe price volatility smith was held responsible for the failure and there were widespread defections from the church including many of smiths closest advisers after a warrant was issued for smiths arrest on a charge of banking fraud smith and rigdon fled kirtland for missouri on the night of january   life in missouri –edit main articles life of joseph smith from  to  and  mormon war by  smith had abandoned plans to redeem zion in jackson county and after smith and rigdon arrived in missouri the town of far west became the new zion in missouri the church also took the name church of jesus christ of latter day saints and construction began on a new temple in the weeks and months after smith and rigdon arrived at far west thousands of latter day saints followed them from kirtland smith encouraged the settlement of land outside caldwell county instituting a settlement in adamondiahman in daviess county during this time a church council expelled many of the oldest and most prominent leaders of the church including john whitmer david whitmer w w phelps and oliver cowdery smith explicitly approved of the expulsion of these men who were known collectively as the dissenters political and religious differences between old missourians and newlyarriving mormon settlers provoked tensions between the two groups much as they had years earlier in jackson county by this time smiths experiences with mob violence led him to believe that his faiths survival required greater militancy against antimormons around june  recent convert sampson avard formed a covert organization called the danites to intimidate mormon dissenters and oppose antimormon militia units though it is unclear how much smith knew of the danites activities he clearly approved of those of which he did know after rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had no place in the mormon community the danites forcibly expelled them from the county in an oration given at the towns fourth of july celebration rigdon declared that mormons would no longer tolerate persecution by the missourians and spoke of a war of extermination if mormons were attacked smith implicitly endorsed this speech and many nonmormons understood it to be a thinlyveiled threat they unleashed a flood of antimormon rhetoric in newspapers and in stump speeches given during the  election campaign on august   nonmormons in gallatin tried to prevent mormons from voting and the electionday scuffles initiated the  mormon war nonmormon vigilantes raided and burned mormon farms and danites and other mormons pillaged nonmormon towns during this period smiths heated rhetoric encouraged some of his followers to take aggressive measures smith himself might not have approved under the impression that an approaching group of armed men were a band of vigilantes mormons attacked the missouri state militia in what became known as the battle of crooked river governor lilburn boggs then ordered that the mormons be exterminated or driven from the state even though they were yet unaware of boggss order on october  a party of missourians surprised and killed seventeen mormons in the hauns mill massacre smith was held for four months in liberty jail the following day the latter day saints surrendered to  state troops and agreed to forfeit their property and leave the state smith was immediately brought before a military court accused of treason and sentenced to be executed the next morning but alexander doniphan smiths former attorney and a brigadier general in the missouri militia refused to carry out the order smith was then sent to a state court for a preliminary hearing where several of his former allies testified against him smith and five others including rigdon were charged with overt acts of treason and transferred to the jail at liberty missouri to await trial smiths months in prison with an ill and whining rigdon strained their relationship meanwhile brigham young thenpresident of the quorum of the twelve apostles rose to prominence among the mormon faithful when he organized the move of about  saints to illinois and eastern iowa smith bore his imprisonment stoically understanding that he was effectively on trial before his own people many of whom considered him a fallen prophet he wrote a personal defense and an apology for the activities of the danites the keys of the kingdom he wrote have not been taken away from us though he directed his followers to collect and publish their stories of persecution he also urged them to moderate their antagonism toward nonmormons on april   after a grand jury hearing in davis county smith and his companions escaped custody almost certainly with the connivance of the sheriff and guards life in nauvoo illinois –edit main article life of joseph smith from  to  many american newspapers criticized missouri for the hauns mill massacre and the states expulsion of the latter day saints and illinois accepted mormon refugees who gathered along the banks of the mississippi river where smith purchased highpriced swampy woodland in the hamlet of commerce smith also attempted to portray the latter day saints as an oppressed minority and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government for help in obtaining reparations during the summer of  while latter day saints in nauvoo suffered from a malaria epidemic smith sent brigham young and other apostles to missions in europe where they made numerous converts many of them poor factory workers depiction of smith at head of the nauvoo legion smith also attracted a few wealthy and influential converts including john c bennett the illinois quartermaster general bennett used his connections in the illinois legislature to obtain an unusually liberal charter for the new city which smith named nauvoo hebrew נָאווּ meaning to be beautiful the charter granted the city virtual autonomy authorized a university and granted nauvoo habeas corpus power—which allowed smith to fend off extradition to missouri though mormon authorities controlled nauvoos civil government the city promised an unusually liberal guarantee of religious freedom the charter also authorized the nauvoo legion an autonomous militia whose actions were limited only by state and federal constitutions lieutenant general smith and major general bennett became its commanders thereby controlling by far the largest body of armed men in illinois smith made bennett assistant president of the church and bennett was elected nauvoos first mayor in  smith began revealing the doctrine of plural marriage to a few of his closest male associates including bennett who used it as an excuse to seduce numerous women wed and unwed when embarrassing rumors of spiritual wifery got abroad smith forced bennetts resignation as nauvoo mayor in retaliation bennett wrote lurid exposés of life in nauvoo smith planned the construction of the nauvoo temple which was completed after his death the early nauvoo years were a period of doctrinal innovation smith introduced baptism for the dead in  and in  construction began on the nauvoo temple as a place for recovering lost ancient knowledge an  revelation promised the restoration of the fulness of the priesthood and in may  smith inaugurated a revised endowment or first anointing the endowment resembled rites of freemasonry that smith had observed two months earlier when he had been initiated into the nauvoo masonic lodge at first the endowment was open only to men who were initiated into the anointed quorum for women smith introduced the relief society a service club and sorority within which smith predicted women would receive the keys of the kingdom smith also elaborated on his plan for a millennial kingdom no longer envisioning the building of zion in nauvoo smith viewed zion as encompassing all of north and south america with mormon settlements being stakes of zions metaphorical tent zion also became less a refuge from an impending tribulation than a great building project in the summer of  smith revealed a plan to establish the millennial kingdom of god which would eventually establish theocratic rule over the whole earth by mid popular opinion had turned against the mormons after an unknown assailant shot and wounded missouri governor lilburn boggs in may  antimormons circulated rumors that smiths bodyguard porter rockwell was the shooter though the evidence was circumstantial boggs ordered smiths extradition certain he would be killed if he ever returned to missouri smith went into hiding twice during the next five months before the us district attorney for illinois argued that smiths extradition to missouri would be unconstitutional rockwell was later tried and acquitted in june  enemies of smith convinced a reluctant illinois governor thomas ford to extradite smith to missouri on the old charge of treason two law officers arrested smith but were intercepted by a party of mormons before they could reach missouri smith was then released on a writ of habeas corpus from the nauvoo municipal court while this ended the missourians attempts at extradition it caused significant political fallout in illinois in december  smith petitioned congress to make nauvoo an independent territory with the right to call out federal troops in its defense smith then wrote to the leading presidential candidates and asked them what they would do to protect the mormons after receiving noncommittal or negative responses smith announced his own thirdparty candidacy for president of the united states suspended regular proselytizing and sent out the quorum of the twelve and hundreds of other political missionaries in march  following a dispute with a federal bureaucrat smith organized the secret council of fifty with authority to decide which national or state laws mormons should obey the council was also to select a site for a large mormon settlement in texas california or oregon where mormons could live under theocratic law beyond other governmental control deathedit main article death of joseph smith a thcentury painting depicting the mob attack inside carthage jail by early  a rift developed between smith and a half dozen of his closest associates most notably william law smiths trusted counselor and robert foster a general of the nauvoo legion disagreed with smith about how to manage nauvoos economy both also said that smith had proposed marriage to their wives believing the dissidents were plotting against his life smith excommunicated them on april   these dissidents formed a competing church and the following month at carthage the county seat they procured indictments against smith for perjury and polygamy on june  the dissidents published the first and only issue of the nauvoo expositor calling for reform within the church and appealing to the political views of the countys antimormons the paper decried smiths new doctrines of many gods alluded to smiths theocratic aspirations and called for a repeal of the nauvoo city charter it also attacked smiths practice of polygamy implying that smith was using religion as a pretext to draw unassuming women to nauvoo in order to seduce and marry them fearing the newspaper would bring the countryside down on the mormons the nauvoo city council declared the expositor a public nuisance and ordered the nauvoo legion to destroy the press smith who feared another mob attack supported the action not realizing that destroying a newspaper was more likely to incite an attack than any libel smith was shot multiple times before and after falling from the window destruction of the newspaper provoked a strident call to arms from thomas c sharp editor of the warsaw signal and longtime critic of smith fearing an uprising smith mobilized the nauvoo legion on june  and declared martial law officials in carthage responded by mobilizing their small detachment of the state militia and governor thomas ford appeared threatening to raise a larger militia unless smith and the nauvoo city council surrendered themselves smith initially fled across the mississippi river but shortly returned and surrendered to ford on june  smith and his brother hyrum rode to carthage to stand trial for inciting a riot once the smiths were in custody the charges were increased to treason gravesite of joseph emma and hyrum smith in nauvoo illinois on june   an armed mob with blackened faces stormed carthage jail where joseph and hyrum were being held hyrum who was trying to secure the door was killed instantly with a shot to the face smith fired a pepperbox pistol that a friend had lent him for selfdefense then sprang for the window he was shot multiple times before falling out the window crying oh lord my god he died shortly after hitting the ground but was shot several times more before the mob dispersed five men were later tried for his murder but all were acquitted smith was buried in nauvoo and is interred there at the smith family cemetery throughout his life smith had been sharply criticized by newspaper editors and after his death newspapers were almost unanimous in portraying smith as a religious fanatic conversely within mormonism smith was memorialized first and foremost as a prophet martyred to seal the testimony of his faith legacyedit impactedit smith attracted thousands of devoted followers before his death in  and millions in the century that followed among mormons he is regarded as a prophet on par with moses and elijah in a  compilation of the  most significant americans of all time smithsonian magazine ranked smith first in the category of religious figures mormons and exmormons have produced a large amount of scholarly work about smith and to a large extent the result has been two discordant pictures of very different people a man of god on the one hand and on the other a fraud preying on the ignorance of his followers believers tended to focus on his achievements and religious teachings deemphasizing his personal defects while detractors focused on his mistakes legal troubles and controversial doctrines during the first half of the th century some writers suggested that smith might have suffered from epileptic seizures or from psychological disorders such as paranoid delusions or manicdepressive illness that might explain his visions and revelations many modern biographers disagree with these ideas more nuanced interpretations range from viewing smith as a prophet who had normal human weaknesses a pious fraud who believed he was called of god to preach repentance and felt justified inventing visions in order to convert people or a gifted mythmaker who was the product of his yankee environment biographers mormon and nonmormon agree that smith was one of the most influential charismatic and innovative figures in american religious history buildings named in honor of smith the

hyrum had he survived would have had the strongest claim followed by smiths brother samuel who died mysteriously a month after his brothers another brother william was unable to attract a sufficient following smiths sons joseph iii and david also had claims but joseph iii was too young and david was yet unborn the council of fifty had a theoretical claim to succession but it was a secret organization some of smiths chosen successors such as oliver cowdery and david whitmer had left the church the two strongest succession candidates were brigham young senior member and president of the quorum of the twelve apostles and sidney rigdon the senior member of the first presidency in a churchwide conference on august  most of the latter day saints elected young who led them to the utah territory as the church of jesus christ of latterday saints lds church membership in youngs denomination surpassed  million members in  smaller groups followed sidney rigdon and james j strang who had based his claim on an allegedlyforged letter of appointment others followed lyman wight and alpheus cutler many members of these smaller groups including most of smiths family eventually coalesced in  under the leadership of joseph smith iii and formed what was known for more than a century as the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints now community of christ which now has about  members as of update members of the denominations originating from smiths teachings number approximately  million family and descendantsedit emma hale smith married joseph smith in  see also list of the wives of joseph smith and children of joseph smith the first of smiths wives emma hale gave birth to nine children during their marriage five of whom died before the age of two the eldest alvin born in  died within hours of birth as did twins thaddeus and louisa born in  when the twins died the smiths adopted another set of twins julia and joseph whose mother had recently died in childbirth joseph died of measles in  in  don carlos who had been born a year earlier died of malaria in  emma gave birth to a stillborn son joseph and emma had four sons who lived to maturity joseph smith iii frederick granger williams smith alexander hale smith and david hyrum smith born in  after smiths death as of update dna testing had provided no evidence that smith had fathered any children by women other than emma throughout her life emma smith frequently denied that her husband had ever taken additional wives emma said that the very first time she ever became aware of a polygamy revelation being attributed to smith by mormons was when she read about it in orson pratts periodical the seer in  emma campaigned publicly against polygamy and was the main signatory of a petition in  with a thousand female signatures denying that smith was connected with polygamy as president of the ladies relief society emma authorized publishing a certificate in the same year denouncing polygamy and denying her husband as its creator or participant even on her deathbed emma denied josephs involvement with polygamy stating no such thing as polygamy or spiritual wifery was taught publicly or privately before my husbands death that i have now or ever had any knowledge of  he had no other wife but me nor did he to my knowledge ever have after smiths death emma smith quickly became alienated from brigham young and the church leadership young whom emma feared and despised was suspicious of her desire to preserve the familys assets from inclusion with those of the church and thought she would be even more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage when most latter day saints moved west she stayed in nauvoo married a nonmormon major lewis c bidamon and withdrew from religion until  when she affiliated with the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints first headed by her son joseph smith iii emma never denied smiths prophetic gift or repudiated her belief in the authenticity of the book of mormon revelationsedit an artistic representation of the golden plates with the urim and thummim connected to a breastplate based on descriptions by smith and others according to richard bushman the signal feature of smiths life was his sense of being guided by revelation instead of presenting ideas with logical arguments smith dictated authoritative revelations and let people decide whether to believe smiths teachings came primarily through his revelations which read like scripture oracular and open to interpretation smith and his followers viewed his revelations as being above teachings or opinions and smiths actions seemed to indicate that he believed in his revelations as much as his most loyal followers smiths first recorded revelation was a rebuke from god for having let martin harris lose  pages of book of mormon manuscript chastising him for fearing man more than god the revelation was given in the voice of god rather than as a declaration mediated through smith and subsequent revelations assumed a similar authoritative style often opening with words such as hearken o ye people which profess my name saith the lord your god book of mormonedit main article book of mormon the book of mormon has been called the longest and most complex of smiths revelations it is organized as a compilation of smaller books each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader it tells the story of the rise and fall of a religious civilization beginning around  bc and ending in  ad the story begins with a family that leaves jerusalem just before the babylonian captivity they eventually construct a ship and sail to a promised land in the western hemisphere there they are divided into two factions nephites and lamanites the nephites become a righteous people who build a temple and live the law of moses though their prophets teach a christian gospel the book explains itself to be largely the work of mormon a nephite prophet and military figure the book closes when mormons son moroni finishes engraving and buries the records written on the golden plates christian themes permeate the work for instance nephite prophets in the book of mormon teach of christs coming and talk of the star that will appear at his birth after the crucifixion and resurrection in jerusalem jesus appears in the americas repeats the sermon on the mount blesses children and appoints twelve disciples the book ends with moronis exhortation to come unto christ early mormons understood the book of mormon to be a religious history of the indigenous peoples of the americas smiths followers view it as a companion to the bible and an additional witness of christ akin to a large apocryphal work modern historian fawn brodie has called the book of mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of smiths times saying that smith composed the book of mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him dan vogel another historian says that the work is autobiographical in nature according to some accounts smith dictated most of the book of mormon by looking into a seer stone placed in a stovepipe hat smith never said how he produced the book of mormon saying only that he translated by the power of god and implying that he had transcribed the words the book of mormon itself states only that its text will come forth by the gift and power of god unto the interpretation thereof as such considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists for at least some of the earliest dictation smith is said to have used the urim and thummim a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates later however he is said to have used a chocolatecolored stone he had found in  that he had used previously for treasure hunting joseph knight said that smith saw the words of the translation while he gazed at the stone or stones in the bottom of his hat excluding all light a process similar to divining the location of treasure sometimes smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table after completing the translation smith gave the brown stone to cowdery but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about  when he said he no longer needed it although the book of mormon drew many converts to the church fawn brodie argued in  that the book lives today because of the prophet not he because of the book smith had assumed a role as prophet seer and apostle of jesus christ and by early  he was introducing himself as joseph the prophet the language of authority in smiths revelations was appealing to converts and the revelations were given with the confidence of an old testament prophet moses and abrahamedit main articles book of abraham and book of moses smith said that in june  he received a revelation of moses in which moses saw the world and the ends thereof and asked god questions about the purpose of creation and mans relationship to god this revelation initiated a revision of the bible on which smith worked sporadically until  and which remained unpublished at his death smith said that he believed the bible had been corrupted through the ages and that his revision worked to restore the original intent it added long passages rewritten according to his inspiration while many changes involved straightening out seeming contradictions or making small clarifications other changes added large lost portions to the text for instance smiths revision nearly tripled the length of the first five chapters of genesis in what would become the book of moses the book of moses begins with moses inquiring of god as to the purpose of creation and is told in this account that god made the earth and heavens to bring humans to eternal life the book also provides an enlarged account of the genesis creation narrative and expands the story of enoch the ancestor of noah in the narrative enoch speaks with god receives a prophetic calling and eventually builds a city of zion so righteous that it was taken to heaven the book also elaborates and expands upon foreshadowing and types of christ in effect christianizing the old testament in  smith encouraged some latter day saints in kirtland to purchase rolls of ancient egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor over the next several years smith worked off and on as events allowed to produce a supposed translation of one of these rolls which he published in  as the book of abraham the book of abraham speaks of the founding of the abrahamic nation astronomy cosmology lineage and priesthood and gave another account of the creation story the papyri from which smith dictated the book of abraham were thought to have been lost in the great chicago fire but several fragments were rediscovered in the s were translated by egyptologists and were determined to be part of the book of the dead with no connection to abraham other revelationsedit see also book of commandments and doctrine and covenants the holy spirit may give you sudden strokes of ideas so that by noticing it you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon those things that were presented unto your minds by the spirit of god will come to pass joseph smith according to parley p pratt smith dictated revelations orally and they were recorded by a scribe without revisions or corrections revelations were immediately copied and then circulated among church members smiths revelations often came in response to specific questions he described the revelatory process as having pure intelligence flowing into him smith however never viewed the wording to be infallible the revelations were not gods words verbatim but couched in language suitable to josephs time in  smith edited and expanded many of the previous revelations publishing them as the book of commandments which later became part of the doctrine and covenants smith gave varying types of revelations some were temporal while others were spiritual or doctrinal some were received for a specific individual while others were directed at the whole church notable revelations include an  revelation called the law containing directions for missionary work rules for organizing society in zion a reiteration of the ten commandments an injunction to administer to the poor and needy and an outline for the law of consecration an  revelation called the vision added to the fundamentals of sin and atonement introduced doctrines of life after salvation the theme of exaltation and a heaven with degrees of glory another  revelation on priesthood was the first to explain priesthood doctrine three months later smith gave a lengthy revelation called the olive leaf containing themes of cosmology and eschatology and discussing subjects such as light truth intelligence and sanctification a related revelation given in  put christ at the center of salvation also in  at a time of temperance agitation smith delivered a revelation called the word of wisdom which counseled a diet of wholesome herbs fruits grains a sparing use of meat and recommended that latter day saints avoid strong alcoholic drinks tobacco and hot drinks later interpreted to mean tea and coffee the word of wisdom was not originally framed as a commandment but a recommendation as such smith and other latter day saints did not strictly follow this counsel though it later became a requirement in the lds church in  smith gave the great revelation that organized the priesthood into quorums and councils and served as a complex blueprint for church structure smiths last revelation on the new and everlasting covenant was recorded in  and dealt with the theology of family the doctrine of sealing and plural marriage before  most of smiths revelations dealt with establishing the church gathering his followers and building the city of zion while later revelations dealt with the priesthood endowment and exaltation the revelations slowed in kirtland during the autumn of  and again after the dedication of the kirtland temple as smith relied more heavily on his own teachings smith moved away from written revelations opening with verily thus saith the lord and taught more in sermons conversations and letters for instance the doctrines of baptism for the dead and the nature of god were introduced in sermons and one of smiths most famed statements about there being no such thing as immaterial matter was recorded from a casual conversation with a methodist preacher views and teachingsedit main article teachings of joseph smith smiths later theology described jesus and god the father as two distinct physical beings cosmology and theologyedit see also mormon cosmology and godhead latter day saints smith taught that all existence was material including a world of spirit matter so fine that it was invisible to all but the purest mortal eyes matter in smiths view could neither be created nor destroyed the creation involved only the reorganization of existing matter like matter smith saw intelligence as coeternal with god and taught that human spirits had been drawn from a preexistent pool of eternal intelligences nevertheless spirits could not experience a fullness of joy unless joined with corporeal bodies according to smith the work and glory of god then was to create worlds across the cosmos where inferior intelligences could be embodied though smith initially viewed god the father as a spirit he eventually began teaching that god was an advanced and glorified man embodied within time and space by the end of his life smith was teaching that both god the father and jesus were distinct beings with physical bodies but the holy spirit was a personage of spirit through the gradual acquisition of knowledge according to smith those who received exaltation could eventually become like god these teachings implied a vast hierarchy of gods with god himself having a father in smiths cosmology those who became gods would reign unified in purpose and will leading spirits of lesser capacity to share immortality and eternal life in smiths view the opportunity to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation apart from those who committed the eternal sin smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife religious authority and ritualedit see also priesthood latter day saints freemasonry and the latter day saint movement and endowment latter day saints smiths teachings were rooted in dispensational restorationism he taught that the church of christ restored through him was a latterday restoration of the early christian faith which had been lost in the great apostasy at first smiths church had little sense of hierarchy his religious authority was derived from visions and revelations though smith did not claim exclusive prophethood an early revelation designated him as the only prophet allowed to issue commandments as moses this religious authority encompassed economic and political as well as spiritual matters for instance in the early s he temporarily instituted a form of religious communism called the united order that required latter day saints to give all their property to the church which was divided among the faithful he also envisioned that the theocratic institutions he established would have a role in the worldwide political organization of the millennium by the mids smith began teaching a hierarchy of three priesthoods—the melchizedek the aaronic and the patriarchal each priesthood was a continuation of biblical priesthoods through patrilineal succession or ordination by biblical figures appearing in visions upon introducing the melchizedek or high priesthood in  smith taught that its recipients would be endowed with power from on high thus fulfilling a need for a greater holiness and an authority commensurate with the new testament apostles this doctrine of endowment evolved through the s until in  the nauvoo endowment included an elaborate ceremony containing elements similar to freemasonry and the jewish tradition of kabbalah the endowment was extended to women in  though smith never clarified whether women could be ordained to priesthood offices smith taught that the high priesthoods endowment of heavenly power included the sealing powers of elijah allowing high priests to effect binding consequences in the afterlife for example this power would enable proxy baptisms for the dead and priesthood marriages that would be effective into the afterlife elijahs sealing powers also enabled the second anointing or fulness sic of the priesthood which according to smith sealed married couples to their exaltation theology of familyedit during the early s smith unfolded a theology of family relations called the new and everlasting covenant that superseded all earthly bonds he taught that outside the covenant marriages were simply matters of contract and that in the afterlife individuals married outside the covenant or not married would be limited in their progression to fully enter the covenant a man and woman must participate in a first anointing a sealing ceremony and a second anointing also called sealing by the holy spirit of promise when fully sealed into the covenant smith said that no sin nor blasphemy other than the eternal sin could keep them from their exaltation in the afterlife according to smith only one person on earth at a time—in this case smith—could possess this power of sealing a painting of smith by bathsheba w smith created circa  smith taught that the highest level of exaltation could be achieved through plural marriage polygamy which was the ultimate manifestation of this new and everlasting covenant plural marriage according to smith allowed an individual to transcend the angelic state and become a god accelerating the expansion of ones heavenly kingdom polygamyedit see also origin of latter day saint polygamy and mormonism and polygamy smith had by some accounts been teaching a polygamy doctrine as early as  and there is unconfirmed evidence that smith was a polygamist by  although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy in  there was a rift between smith and oliver cowdery over the issue cowdery suspected smith had engaged in a relationship with his serving girl fanny alger smith never denied a relationship but insisted it was not adulterous presumably because he had taken alger as a plural wife in april  smith wed louisa beaman during the next twoandahalf years he married or was sealed to about  additional women ten of whom were already married to other men some of these polyandrous marriages were done with the consent of the first husbands and some plural marriages may have been considered eternityonly sealings ten of smiths plural wives were between the ages of fourteen and twenty others were over fifty the practice of polygamy was kept secret from both nonmormons and most members of the church during smiths lifetime polygamy caused a breach between smith and his first wife emma although emma knew of some of her husbands marriages she almost certainly did not know the extent of his polygamous activities in  emma temporarily accepted smiths marriage to four women boarded in the smith household but soon regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave in july  smith dictated a revelation directing emma to accept plural marriage but the two were not reconciled until september  after emma began participating in temple ceremonies political viewsedit the neutrality

message while campaigning for president of the united states in  smith had opportunity to take political positions on issues of the day smith considered the us constitution and especially the bill of rights to be inspired by god and the latter day saints best and perhaps only defense he believed a strong central government was crucial to the nations wellbeing and thought democracy better than tyranny—although he also taught that a theocratic monarchy was the ideal form of government in foreign affairs smith was an expansionist though he viewed expansionism as brotherhood smith favored a strong central bank and high tariffs to protect american business and agriculture he disfavored imprisonment of convicts except for murder preferring efforts to reform criminals through labor he also opposed courtsmartial for military deserters he supported capital punishment but opposed hanging preferring execution by firing squad or beheading on the issue of slavery smith took different positions initially he opposed it but during the mids when the mormons were settling in missouri a slave state smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly antiabolitionist essay then in the early s after mormons had been expelled from missouri he once again opposed slavery during his presidential campaign of  he proposed ending slavery by  and compensating slaveholders for their loss smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites and he welcomed slaves into the church however he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters and he opposed interracial marriage smith declared that he would be one of the instruments in fulfilling nebuchadnezzars statue vision in the book of daniel that secular government would be destroyed without sword or gun and would be replaced with a theodemocratic kingdom of god smith taught that this kingdom would be governed by theocratic principles but that it would also be multidenominational and democratic so long as the people chose wisely ethics and behavioredit a succinct statement of ethics by smith is found in his th article of faith we believe in being honest true chaste benevolent virtuous and in doing good to all men indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of paul—we believe all things we hope all things we have endured many things and hope to be able to endure all things if there is anything virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy we seek after these things smith said his ethical rule was when the lord commands do it he also taught that which is wrong under one circumstance may be and often is right under another god said thou shalt not kill—at another time he said thou shalt utterly destroy this is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted—by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the elders of the kingdom are placed whatever god requires is right  even things which may be considered abominable to all those who do not understand the order of heaven beginning in the mids and into the s as the mormon people became involved in conflicts with the missouri and illinois state governments smith taught that congress has no power to make a law that would abridge the rights of my religion and that they were not under the obligation to follow laws they deemed as being contrary to their religious privilege smith may have thus felt justified in

mormonism and the latter day saint movement when he was twentyfour smith published the book of mormon by the time of his death fourteen years later he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religious culture that continues to the present smith was born in sharon vermont by  he had moved with his family to what became known as the burnedover district of western new york an area of intense religious revivalism during the second great awakening according to smith he experienced a series of visions including one in which he saw two personages presumably god the father and jesus christ and others in which an angel directed him to a buried book of golden plates inscribed with a judeochristian history of an ancient american civilization in  smith published what he said was an english translation of these plates the book of mormon the same year he organized the church of christ calling it a restoration of the early christian church members of the church were later called latter day saints or mormons and in  smith announced a revelation that renamed the church as the church of jesus christ of latter day saints in  smith and his followers moved west planning to build a communalistic american zion they first gathered in kirtland ohio and established an outpost in independence missouri which was intended to be zions center place during the s smith sent out missionaries published revelations and supervised construction of the expensive kirtland temple the collapse of the churchsponsored kirtland safety society and violent skirmishes with nonmormon missourians caused smith and his followers to establish a new settlement at nauvoo illinois where he became a spiritual and political leader in  smith and the nauvoo city council angered nonmormons by destroying a newspaper that had criticized smiths power and practice of polygamy after smith was imprisoned in carthage illinois he was killed when a mob stormed the jailhouse smith published many revelations and other texts that his followers regard as scripture his teachings include unique views about the nature of god cosmology family structures political organization and religious collectivism his followers regard him as a prophet comparable to moses and elijah and several religious denominations consider themselves the continuation of the church he organized including the

jr was born on december   in sharon vermont to lucy mack smith and her husband joseph sr a merchant and farmer after suffering a crippling bone infection when he was seven the younger smith used crutches for three years in – after an illfated business venture and three years of crop failures the smith family moved to the western new york village of palmyra and eventually took a mortgage on a acre  ha farm in the nearby town of manchester during the second great awakening the region was a hotbed of religious enthusiasm and between  and  there were several camp meetings and revivals in the palmyra area although smiths parents disagreed about religion the family was caught up in this excitement smith later said he became interested in religion at about the age of twelve he participated in church classes and read the bible as a teenager he may have been sympathetic to methodism with other family members smith also engaged in religious folk magic not an uncommon practice at the time both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from god smith said that although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations years later smith said that in  he had received a vision that resolved his religious confusion while praying in a wooded area near his home he said that god in a vision had told him his sins were forgiven and that all contemporary churches had turned aside from the gospel smith said he told the experience to a preacher who dismissed the story with contempt but the experience was largely unknown even to most mormons until the s although smith may have understood the event as a personal conversion this first vision later grew in importance among mormons who today see it as the first event in the restoration of the gospel smith said he received golden plates from the angel moroni at the hill cumorah smith said that in  while praying one night for forgiveness from his sins he was visited by an angel named moroni who revealed the location of a buried book made of golden plates as well as other artifacts including a breastplate and a set of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame which had been hidden in a hill in manchester near his home smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning but was unsuccessful because the angel prevented him smith reported that during the next four years he made annual visits to the hill but each time returned without the plates meanwhile the smith family faced financial hardship due in part to the november  death of smiths oldest brother alvin who had assumed a leadership role in the family family members supplemented their meager farm income by hiring out for odd jobs and working as treasure seekers a type of magical supernaturalism common during the period smith was said to have an ability to locate lost items by looking into a seer stone which he also used in treasure hunting including several unsuccessful attempts to find buried treasure sponsored by a wealthy farmer in chenango county new york in  smith was brought before a chenango county court for glasslooking or pretending to find lost treasure the result of the proceeding remains unclear as primary sources report various conflicting outcomes while boarding at the hale house in harmony pennsylvania smith began courting emma hale when smith proposed marriage emmas father isaac hale objected because smith was a stranger who had no means of supporting his daughter other than money digging of which he disapproved smith and emma eloped and married on january   after which the couple began boarding with smiths parents in manchester later that year when smith promised to abandon treasure seeking hale offered to let the couple live on his property in harmony and help smith get started in business smith said that he made his last annual visit to the hill on september   taking emma with him this time he said he retrieved the plates and put them in a locked chest he said the angel commanded him not to show the plates to anyone else but to publish their translation reputed to be the religious record of indigenous americans smith said that the plates were engraved in an unknown language reformed egyptian and he told associates that he was capable of reading and translating them although smith had left his treasure hunting company his former associates believed he had doublecrossed them by taking for himself what they considered joint property after they ransacked places where a competing treasureseer said the plates were hidden smith decided to leave palmyra founding a church –edit main article life of joseph smith from  to  in october  smith and his pregnant wife moved from palmyra to harmony now oakland pennsylvania aided by money from a relatively prosperous neighbor martin harris living near his inlaws smith transcribed some characters that he said were engraved on the plates and then dictated a translation to his wife in february  martin harris arrived to assist smith by transcribing his dictation harris also took a sample of the characters to a few prominent scholars including charles anthon who harris said initially authenticated the characters and their translation but then retracted his opinion after learning that smith was supposed to have received the plates from an angel anthon denied harriss account of the meeting claiming instead that he had tried to convince harris that he had been the victim of a fraud nevertheless harris returned to harmony in april  encouraged to continue as smiths scribe smith continued to dictate to harris until midjune  when harris began having doubts about the project fueled in part by his wifes skepticism harris convinced smith to let him take the existing  pages of manuscript to palmyra to show a few family members including his wife harris lost the manuscript—of which there was no other copy—at about the same time smiths wife emma gave birth to a son alvin who died the same day smith said that as punishment for losing the manuscript the angel took away the plates and revoked his ability to translate during this dark period smith briefly attended methodist meetings with his wife until a cousin of hers objected to inclusion of a practicing necromancer on the methodist class roll cover page of the book of mormon original  edition smith said that the angel returned the plates to him on september   and he resumed dictation in april  after he met oliver cowdery who replaced harris as his scribe they worked full time on the manuscript between april and early june  and then moved to fayette new york where they continued to work at the home of cowderys friend peter whitmer when the narrative described an institutional church and a requirement for baptism smith and cowdery baptized each other dictation was completed around july   although smith had previously refused to show the plates to anyone he told martin harris oliver cowdery and david whitmer that they would be allowed to see them these men known collectively as the three witnesses—along with a later group of eight witnesses composed of male members of the whitmer and smith families—signed statements testifying that they had seen the golden plates statements were issued by both the three witnesses and the eight witnesses the primary distinction between the two groups were that the three witnesses stated that an angel showed them the plates and the voice of god confirmed their truth while the eight witnesses where shown the plates by smith according to smith the angel moroni took back the plates once smith finished using them the completed work the book of mormon was published in palmyra on march   by printer e b grandin martin harris having mortgaged his farm to finance it soon after on april   smith and his followers formally organized the church of christ and small branches were established in palmyra fayette and colesville new york the book of mormon brought smith regional notoriety and opposition from those who remembered his moneydigging and the  chenango county trial after cowdery baptized several new members the mormons received threats of mob violence and before smith could confirm the newly baptized members he was arrested and brought to trial as a disorderly person he was acquitted but both he and cowdery had to flee colesville to escape a gathering mob in probable reference to this period of flight smith said that peter james and john had appeared to him and had ordained him and cowdery to a higher priesthood smiths authority was undermined when oliver cowdery hiram page and other church members also claimed to receive revelations in response smith dictated a revelation which clarified his office as a prophet and an apostle and which declared that only he held the keys of the mysteries and the revelations with the ability to inscribe scripture for the church shortly after the conference smith dispatched cowdery peter whitmer and others on a mission to proselytize native americans cowdery was also assigned the task of locating the site of the new jerusalem on their way to missouri cowderys party passed through northeastern ohio where sidney rigdon and over a hundred followers of his variety of campbellite restorationism converted to mormonism more than doubling the size of the church rigdon soon visited new york and quickly became smiths primary assistant with growing opposition in new york smith gave forth as revelation that kirtland was the eastern boundary of the new jerusalem and that his followers must gather there life in ohio –edit main articles life of joseph smith from  to  and life of joseph smith from  to  when smith moved to kirtland ohio in january  he encountered a religious culture that included enthusiastic demonstrations of spiritual gifts including fits and trances rolling on the ground and speaking in tongues smith tamed these outbursts by producing two revelations that brought the kirtland congregation under his own authority rigdons followers had also been practicing a form of communalism and this smith adopted calling it the united order smith had promised church elders that in kirtland they would receive an endowment of heavenly power and at the june  general conference he introduced the greater authority of a high melchizedek priesthood to the church hierarchy a mob tarred and feathered smith in  converts poured into kirtland by the summer of  there were fifteen hundred to two thousand mormons in the vicinity many expecting smith to lead them shortly to the millennial kingdom though the mission to the indians had been a failure the missionaries sent on their way by a government indian agent cowdery reported that he had found the site of the new jerusalem in jackson county missouri after smith visited in july  he agreed pronouncing the frontier hamlet of independence the center place of zion nevertheless rigdon disapproved and for most of the s the church remained divided between ohio and missouri smith continued to live in ohio but visited missouri again in early  in order to prevent a rebellion of prominent church members including cowdery who believed the church in missouri was being neglected smiths trip was hastened by a mob of ohio residents who were incensed over the united order and smiths political power the mob beat smith and rigdon unconscious tarred and feathered them and left them for dead in jackson county missouri residents resented the mormon newcomers for both political and religious reasons tension increased until july  when nonmormons forcibly evicted the mormons and destroyed their property smith advised them to bear the violence patiently until they were attacked a fourth time after which they could fight back after armed bands exchanged fire and one mormon and two nonmormons were killed the old settlers brutally expelled the mormons from the county smith ended the communitarian experiment and changed the name of the church to the church of latter day saints before leading a small paramilitary expedition later called zions camp to aid the missouri mormons as a military endeavor the expedition was a failure the men were outnumbered and suffered from dissension and a cholera outbreak nevertheless zions camp transformed mormon leadership and many future church leaders came from among the participants after the camp returned smith drew heavily from its participants to establish five governing bodies in the church all originally of equal authority to check one another among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles smith gave a revelation saying that to redeem zion his followers would have to receive an endowment in the kirtland temple and in march  at the temples dedication many participants in the promised endowment saw visions of angels spoke in tongues and prophesied smith dedicated the kirtland temple in  in late  a series of internal disputes led to the collapse of the kirtland mormon community smith was blamed for having promoted a churchsponsored bank that failed and accused of engaging in a sexual relationship with his serving girl fanny alger building the temple had left the church deeply in debt and smith was hounded by creditors having heard of a large sum of money supposedly hidden in salem massachusetts smith traveled there and received a revelation that god had much treasure in this city but after a month he returned to kirtland emptyhanded in january  smith and other church leaders created a joint stock company called the kirtland safety society to act as a quasibank the company issued bank notes capitalized in part by real estate smith encouraged the latter day saints to buy the notes and he invested heavily in them himself but the bank failed within a month as a result the latter day saints in kirtland suffered intense pressure from debt collectors and severe price volatility smith was held responsible for the failure and there were widespread defections from the church including many of smiths closest advisers after a warrant was issued for smiths arrest on a charge of banking fraud smith and rigdon fled kirtland for missouri on the night of january   life in missouri –edit main articles life of joseph smith from  to  and  mormon war by  smith had abandoned plans to redeem zion in jackson county and after smith and rigdon arrived in missouri the town of far west became the new zion in missouri the church also took the name church of jesus christ of latter day saints and construction began on a new temple in the weeks and months after smith and rigdon arrived at far west thousands of latter day saints followed them from kirtland smith encouraged the settlement of land outside caldwell county instituting a settlement in adamondiahman in daviess county during this time a church council expelled many of the oldest and most prominent leaders of the church including john whitmer david whitmer w w phelps and oliver cowdery smith explicitly approved of the expulsion of these men who were known collectively as the dissenters political and religious differences between old missourians and newlyarriving mormon settlers provoked tensions between the two groups much as they had years earlier in jackson county by this time smiths experiences with mob violence led him to believe that his faiths survival required greater militancy against antimormons around june  recent convert sampson avard formed a covert organization called the danites to intimidate mormon dissenters and oppose antimormon militia units though it is unclear how much smith knew of the danites activities he clearly approved of those of which he did know after rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had no place in the mormon community the danites forcibly expelled them from the county in an oration given at the towns fourth of july celebration rigdon declared that mormons would no longer tolerate persecution by the missourians and spoke of a war of extermination if mormons were attacked smith implicitly endorsed this speech and many nonmormons understood it to be a thinlyveiled threat they unleashed a flood of antimormon rhetoric in newspapers and in stump speeches given during the  election campaign on august   nonmormons in gallatin tried to prevent mormons from voting and the electionday scuffles initiated the  mormon war nonmormon vigilantes raided and burned mormon farms and danites and other mormons pillaged nonmormon towns during this period smiths heated rhetoric encouraged some of his followers to take aggressive measures smith himself might not have approved under the impression that an approaching group of armed men were a band of vigilantes mormons attacked the missouri state militia in what became known as the battle of crooked river governor lilburn boggs then ordered that the mormons be exterminated or driven from the state even though they were yet unaware of boggss order on october  a party of missourians surprised and killed seventeen mormons in the hauns mill massacre smith was held for four months in liberty jail the following day the latter day saints surrendered to  state troops and agreed to forfeit their property and leave the state smith was immediately brought before a military court accused of treason and sentenced to be executed the next morning but alexander doniphan smiths former attorney and a brigadier general in the missouri militia refused to carry out the order smith was then sent to a state court for a preliminary hearing where several of his former allies testified against him smith and five others including rigdon were charged with overt acts of treason and transferred to the jail at liberty missouri to await trial smiths months in prison with an ill and whining rigdon strained their relationship meanwhile brigham young thenpresident of the quorum of the twelve apostles rose to prominence among the mormon faithful when he organized the move of about  saints to illinois and eastern iowa smith bore his imprisonment stoically understanding that he was effectively on trial before his own people many of whom considered him a fallen prophet he wrote a personal defense and an apology for the activities of the danites the keys of the kingdom he wrote have not been taken away from us though he directed his followers to collect and publish their stories of persecution he also urged them to moderate their antagonism toward nonmormons on april   after a grand jury hearing in davis county smith and his companions escaped custody almost certainly with the connivance of the sheriff and guards life in nauvoo illinois –edit main article life of joseph smith from  to  many american newspapers criticized missouri for the hauns mill massacre and the states expulsion of the latter day saints and illinois accepted mormon refugees who gathered along the banks of the mississippi river where smith purchased highpriced swampy woodland in the hamlet of commerce smith also attempted to portray the latter day saints as an oppressed minority and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government for help in obtaining reparations during the summer of  while latter day saints in nauvoo suffered from a malaria epidemic smith sent brigham young and other apostles to missions in europe where they made numerous converts many of them poor factory workers depiction of smith at head of the nauvoo legion smith also attracted a few wealthy and influential converts including john c bennett the illinois quartermaster general bennett used his connections in the illinois legislature to obtain an unusually liberal charter for the new city which smith named nauvoo hebrew נָאווּ meaning to be beautiful the charter granted the city virtual autonomy authorized a university and granted nauvoo habeas corpus power—which allowed smith to fend off extradition to missouri though mormon authorities controlled nauvoos civil government the city promised an unusually liberal guarantee of religious freedom the charter also authorized the nauvoo legion an autonomous militia whose actions were limited only by state and federal constitutions lieutenant general smith and major general bennett became its commanders thereby controlling by far the largest body of armed men in illinois smith made bennett assistant president of the church and bennett was elected nauvoos first mayor in  smith began revealing the doctrine of plural marriage to a few of his closest male associates including bennett who used it as an excuse to seduce numerous women wed and unwed when embarrassing rumors of spiritual wifery got abroad smith forced bennetts resignation as nauvoo mayor in retaliation bennett wrote lurid exposés of life in nauvoo smith planned the construction of the nauvoo temple which was completed after his death the early nauvoo years were a period of doctrinal innovation smith introduced baptism for the dead in  and in  construction began on the nauvoo temple as a place for recovering lost ancient knowledge an  revelation promised the restoration of the fulness of the priesthood and in may  smith inaugurated a revised endowment or first anointing the endowment resembled rites of freemasonry that smith had observed two months earlier when he had been initiated into the nauvoo masonic lodge at first the endowment was open only to men who were initiated into the anointed quorum for women smith introduced the relief society a service club and sorority within which smith predicted women would receive the keys of the kingdom smith also elaborated on his plan for a millennial kingdom no longer envisioning the building of zion in nauvoo smith viewed zion as encompassing all of north and south america with mormon settlements being stakes of zions metaphorical tent zion also became less a refuge from an impending tribulation than a great building project in the summer of  smith revealed a plan to establish the millennial kingdom of god which would eventually establish theocratic rule over the whole earth by mid popular opinion had turned against the mormons after an unknown assailant shot and wounded missouri governor lilburn boggs in may

returned to missouri smith went into hiding twice during the next five months before the us district attorney for illinois argued that smiths extradition to missouri would be unconstitutional rockwell was later tried and acquitted in june  enemies of smith convinced a reluctant illinois governor thomas ford to extradite smith to missouri on the old charge of treason two law officers arrested smith but were intercepted by a party of mormons before they could reach missouri smith was then released on a writ of habeas corpus from the nauvoo municipal court while this ended the missourians attempts at extradition it caused significant political fallout in illinois in december  smith petitioned congress to make nauvoo an independent territory with the right to call out federal troops in its defense smith then wrote to the leading presidential candidates and asked them what they would do to protect the mormons after receiving noncommittal or negative responses smith announced his own thirdparty candidacy for president of the united states suspended regular proselytizing and sent out the quorum of the twelve and hundreds of other political missionaries in march  following a dispute

mob attack inside carthage jail by early  a rift developed between smith and a half dozen of his closest associates most notably william law smiths trusted counselor and robert foster a general of the nauvoo legion disagreed with smith about how to manage nauvoos economy both also said that smith had proposed marriage to their wives believing the dissidents were plotting against his life smith excommunicated them on april   these dissidents formed a competing church and the following month at carthage the county seat they procured indictments against smith for perjury and polygamy on june  the dissidents published the first and only issue of the nauvoo expositor calling for reform within the church and appealing to the political views of the countys antimormons the paper decried smiths new doctrines of many gods alluded to smiths theocratic aspirations and called for a repeal of the nauvoo city charter it also attacked smiths practice of polygamy implying that smith was using religion as a pretext to draw unassuming women to nauvoo in order to seduce and marry them fearing the newspaper would bring the countryside down on the mormons the nauvoo city council declared the expositor a public nuisance and ordered the nauvoo legion to destroy the press smith who feared another mob attack supported the action not realizing that destroying a newspaper was more likely to incite an attack than any libel smith was shot multiple times before and after falling from the window destruction of the newspaper provoked a strident call to arms from thomas c sharp editor of the warsaw signal and longtime critic of smith fearing an uprising smith mobilized the nauvoo legion on june  and declared martial law officials in carthage responded by mobilizing their small detachment of the state militia and governor thomas ford appeared threatening to raise a larger militia unless smith and the nauvoo city council surrendered themselves smith initially fled across the mississippi river but shortly returned and surrendered to ford on june  smith and his brother hyrum rode to carthage to stand trial for inciting a riot once the smiths were in custody the charges were increased

falling out the window crying oh lord my god he died shortly after hitting the ground but was shot several times more before the mob dispersed five men were later tried for his murder but all were acquitted smith was buried in nauvoo and is interred there at the smith family cemetery throughout his life smith had been sharply criticized by newspaper editors and after his death newspapers were almost unanimous in portraying smith as a religious fanatic conversely within mormonism smith was memorialized first and foremost as a prophet martyred to seal the testimony of his faith legacyedit impactedit smith attracted thousands of devoted followers before his death in  and millions in the century that followed among mormons he is regarded as a prophet on par with moses and elijah in a  compilation of the  most significant americans of all time smithsonian magazine ranked smith first in the category of religious figures mormons and exmormons have produced a large amount of scholarly work about smith and to a large extent the result has been two discordant pictures of very different people a man of god on the one hand and on the other a fraud preying on the ignorance of his followers believers tended to focus on his achievements and religious teachings deemphasizing his personal defects while detractors focused on his mistakes legal troubles and controversial doctrines during the first half of the th century some writers suggested that smith might have suffered from epileptic seizures or from psychological disorders such as paranoid delusions or manicdepressive illness that might explain his visions and revelations many modern biographers disagree with these ideas more nuanced interpretations range from viewing smith as a prophet who had normal human weaknesses a pious fraud who believed he was called of god to preach repentance and felt justified inventing visions in order to convert people or a gifted mythmaker who was the product of his yankee environment biographers mormon and nonmormon agree that smith was one of the most influential charismatic and innovative figures in american religious history buildings named in honor of smith the

following smiths sons joseph iii and david also had claims but joseph iii was too young and david was yet unborn the council of fifty had a theoretical claim to succession but it was a secret organization some of smiths chosen successors such as oliver cowdery and david whitmer had left the church the two strongest succession candidates were brigham young senior member and president of the quorum of the twelve apostles and sidney rigdon the senior member of the first presidency in a churchwide conference on august  most of the latter day saints elected young who led them to the utah

based his claim on an allegedlyforged letter of appointment others followed lyman wight and alpheus cutler many members of these smaller groups including most of smiths family eventually coalesced in

other than emma throughout her life emma smith frequently denied that her husband had ever taken additional wives emma said that the very first time she ever became aware of a polygamy revelation being attributed to smith by mormons was when she read about it in orson pratts periodical the seer in  emma campaigned publicly against polygamy and was the main signatory of a petition in  with a thousand female signatures denying that smith was connected with polygamy as president of the ladies relief society emma authorized publishing a certificate in the same year denouncing polygamy and denying her husband as its creator or participant even on her deathbed emma denied josephs involvement with polygamy stating no such thing as polygamy or spiritual wifery was taught publicly or privately before my husbands death that i have now or ever had any knowledge of  he had no other wife but me nor did he to my knowledge ever have after smiths death emma smith quickly became alienated from brigham young and the church leadership young whom emma feared and despised was suspicious of her desire to preserve the familys assets from inclusion with those of the church and thought she would be even more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage when most latter day saints moved west she stayed in nauvoo married a nonmormon major lewis c bidamon and withdrew from

belief in the authenticity of the book of mormon revelationsedit an artistic representation of the golden plates with the urim and thummim connected to a breastplate based on descriptions by smith and others according to richard bushman the signal feature of smiths life was his sense of being guided by revelation instead of presenting ideas with logical arguments smith dictated authoritative revelations and let people decide whether to believe smiths teachings came primarily through his revelations which read like scripture oracular and open to interpretation smith and his followers viewed his revelations as being above teachings or opinions and smiths actions seemed to indicate that he believed in his revelations as much as his most loyal followers smiths first recorded revelation was a rebuke from god for having let martin harris lose  pages of book of mormon manuscript chastising him for fearing man more than god the revelation was given in the voice of god rather than as a declaration mediated through smith and subsequent revelations assumed a similar authoritative style often opening with words such as hearken o ye people which profess my name saith the lord your god book of mormonedit main article book of mormon the book of mormon has been called the longest and most complex of smiths revelations it is organized as a compilation of smaller books each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader it tells the story of the rise and fall of a religious civilization beginning around  bc and ending in  ad the story begins with a family that leaves jerusalem just before the babylonian captivity they eventually construct a ship and sail to a promised land in the western hemisphere there they are divided into two factions nephites and lamanites the nephites become a righteous people who build a temple and live the law of moses though their prophets teach a christian gospel the book explains itself to be largely the work of mormon a nephite prophet and military figure the book closes when mormons son moroni finishes engraving and buries the records written on the golden plates christian themes permeate the work for instance nephite prophets in the book of mormon teach of christs coming and talk of the star that will appear at his birth after the crucifixion and resurrection in jerusalem jesus appears in the americas repeats the sermon on the mount blesses children and appoints twelve disciples the book ends with moronis exhortation to come unto christ early mormons understood the book of mormon to be a religious history of the indigenous peoples of the americas smiths followers view it as a companion to the bible and an additional witness of christ akin to a large apocryphal work modern historian fawn brodie has called the book of mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of smiths times saying that smith composed the book of mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him dan vogel another historian says that the work is autobiographical in nature according to some accounts smith dictated most of the book of mormon by looking into a seer stone placed in a stovepipe hat smith never said how he produced the book of mormon saying only that he translated by the power of god and implying that he had transcribed the words the book of mormon itself states only that its text will come forth by the gift and power of god unto the interpretation thereof as such considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists for at least some of the earliest dictation smith is said to have used the urim and thummim a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates later however he is said to have used a chocolatecolored stone he had found in  that he had used previously for treasure hunting joseph knight said that smith saw the words of the translation while he gazed at the stone or stones in the bottom of his hat excluding all light a process similar to divining the location of treasure sometimes smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table after completing the translation smith gave the brown stone to cowdery but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about  when he said he no longer needed it although the book of mormon drew many converts to the church fawn brodie argued in  that the book lives today because of the prophet not he because of the book smith had assumed a role as prophet seer and apostle of jesus christ and by early  he was introducing himself as joseph the prophet the language of authority in smiths revelations was appealing to converts and the revelations were given with the confidence of an old testament prophet moses and abrahamedit main articles book of abraham and book of moses smith said that in june  he received a revelation of moses in which moses saw the world and the ends thereof and asked god questions about the purpose of creation and mans relationship to god this revelation initiated a revision of the bible on which smith worked sporadically until  and which remained unpublished at his death smith said that he believed the bible had been corrupted through the ages and that his revision worked to restore the original intent it added long passages rewritten according to his inspiration while many changes involved straightening out seeming contradictions or making small clarifications other changes added large lost portions to the text for instance smiths revision nearly tripled the length of the first five chapters of genesis in what would become the book of moses the book of moses begins with moses inquiring of god as to the purpose of creation and is told in this account that god made the earth and heavens to bring humans to eternal life the book also provides an enlarged account of the genesis creation narrative and expands the story of enoch the ancestor of noah in the narrative enoch speaks with god receives a prophetic calling and eventually builds a city of zion so righteous that it was taken to heaven the book also elaborates and expands upon foreshadowing and types of christ in effect christianizing the old testament in  smith encouraged some latter day saints in kirtland to purchase rolls of ancient egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor over the next several years smith worked off and on as events allowed to produce a supposed translation of one of these rolls which he published in  as the book of abraham the book of abraham speaks of the founding of the abrahamic nation astronomy cosmology lineage and priesthood and gave another account of the creation story the papyri from which smith dictated the book of abraham were thought to have been lost in the great chicago fire but several fragments were rediscovered in the s were translated by egyptologists and were determined to be part of the book of the dead with no connection to abraham other revelationsedit see also book of commandments and doctrine and covenants the holy spirit may give you sudden strokes of ideas so

smith dictated revelations orally and they were recorded by a scribe without revisions or corrections revelations were immediately copied and then circulated among church members smiths revelations often came in response to specific questions he described the revelatory process as having pure intelligence flowing into him smith however never viewed the wording to be infallible the revelations were not gods words verbatim but couched in language suitable to josephs time in  smith edited and expanded many of the previous revelations publishing them as the book of commandments which later became part of the doctrine and covenants smith gave varying types of revelations some were temporal while others were spiritual or doctrinal some were received for a specific individual while others were directed at the whole church notable revelations include an  revelation called the law containing directions for missionary work rules for organizing society in zion a reiteration of the ten commandments an injunction to administer to the poor and needy and an outline for the law of consecration an  revelation called the vision added to the fundamentals of sin and atonement introduced doctrines of life after salvation the theme of exaltation and a heaven with degrees of glory another  revelation on priesthood was the first to explain priesthood doctrine three months later smith gave a lengthy revelation called the olive leaf containing themes of cosmology and eschatology and discussing subjects such as light truth intelligence and sanctification a related revelation given in  put christ at the center of salvation also in  at a time of temperance agitation smith delivered a revelation called the word of wisdom which counseled a diet of wholesome herbs fruits grains a sparing use of meat and recommended that latter day saints avoid strong alcoholic drinks tobacco and hot drinks later interpreted to mean tea and coffee the word of wisdom was not originally framed as a commandment but a recommendation as such smith and other latter day saints did not strictly follow this counsel though it later became a requirement in the lds church in  smith gave the great revelation that organized the priesthood into quorums and councils and served as a complex blueprint for church structure smiths last revelation on the new and everlasting covenant was recorded in  and dealt with the theology of family the doctrine of sealing and plural marriage before  most of smiths revelations dealt with establishing the church gathering his followers and building the city of zion while later revelations dealt with the priesthood endowment and exaltation the revelations slowed in kirtland during the autumn of  and again after the dedication of the kirtland temple as smith relied more heavily on his own teachings smith moved away from written revelations opening with verily thus saith the lord and taught more in sermons conversations and letters for instance the doctrines of baptism for the dead and the nature of god were introduced in sermons and one of smiths most famed statements about there being no such thing as immaterial matter was recorded from a casual conversation with a methodist preacher views and teachingsedit main article teachings of joseph smith smiths later theology described jesus and god the father as two distinct physical beings cosmology and theologyedit see also mormon cosmology and godhead latter day saints smith taught that all existence was material including a world of spirit matter so fine that it was invisible to all but the purest mortal eyes matter in smiths view could neither be created nor destroyed the creation involved only the reorganization of existing matter like matter smith saw intelligence as coeternal with god and taught that human spirits had been drawn from a preexistent pool of eternal intelligences nevertheless spirits could not experience a fullness of joy unless joined with corporeal bodies according to smith the work and glory of god then was to create worlds across the cosmos where inferior intelligences could be embodied though smith initially viewed god the father as a spirit he eventually began teaching that god was an advanced and glorified man embodied within time and space by the end of his life smith was teaching that both god the father and jesus were distinct beings with physical bodies but the holy spirit was a personage of spirit through the gradual acquisition of knowledge according to smith those who received exaltation could eventually become like god these teachings implied a vast hierarchy of gods with god himself having a father in smiths cosmology those who became gods would reign unified in purpose and will leading spirits of lesser capacity to share immortality and eternal life in smiths view the opportunity to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation apart from those who committed the eternal sin smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife religious authority and ritualedit see also priesthood latter day saints freemasonry and the latter day saint movement and endowment latter day saints smiths teachings were rooted in dispensational restorationism he taught that the church of christ restored through him was a latterday restoration of the early christian faith which had been lost in the great apostasy at first smiths church had little sense of hierarchy his religious authority was derived from visions and revelations though smith did not claim exclusive prophethood an early revelation designated him as the only prophet allowed to issue commandments as moses this religious authority encompassed economic and political as well as spiritual matters for instance in the early s he temporarily instituted a form of religious communism called the united order that required latter day saints to give all their property to the church which was divided among the faithful he also envisioned that the theocratic institutions he established would have a role in the worldwide political organization of the millennium by the mids smith began teaching a hierarchy of three priesthoods—the melchizedek the aaronic and the patriarchal each priesthood was a continuation of biblical priesthoods through patrilineal succession or ordination by biblical figures appearing in visions upon introducing the melchizedek or high priesthood in  smith taught that its recipients would be endowed with power from on high thus fulfilling a need for a greater holiness and an authority commensurate with the new testament apostles this doctrine of endowment evolved through the s until in  the nauvoo endowment included an elaborate ceremony containing elements similar to freemasonry and the jewish tradition of kabbalah the endowment was extended to women in  though smith never clarified whether women could be ordained to priesthood offices smith taught that the high priesthoods endowment of heavenly power included the sealing powers of elijah allowing high priests to effect binding consequences in the afterlife for example this power would enable proxy baptisms for the dead and priesthood marriages that would be effective into the afterlife elijahs sealing powers also enabled the second anointing or fulness sic of the priesthood which according to smith sealed married couples to their exaltation theology of familyedit during the early s smith unfolded a theology of family relations called the new and everlasting covenant that superseded all earthly bonds he taught that outside the covenant marriages were simply matters of contract and that in the afterlife individuals married outside the covenant or not married would be limited in their progression to fully enter the covenant a man and woman must participate in a first anointing a sealing ceremony and a second anointing also called sealing by the holy spirit of promise when fully sealed into the covenant smith said that no sin nor blasphemy other than the eternal sin could keep them from their exaltation in the afterlife according to smith only one person on earth at a time—in this case smith—could possess this power of sealing a painting of smith by bathsheba w smith created circa  smith taught that the highest level of exaltation could be achieved through plural marriage polygamy which was the ultimate manifestation of this new and everlasting covenant plural marriage according to smith allowed an individual to transcend the angelic state and become a god accelerating the expansion of ones heavenly kingdom polygamyedit see also origin of latter day saint polygamy and mormonism and polygamy smith had by some accounts been teaching a polygamy doctrine as early as  and there is unconfirmed evidence that smith was a polygamist by  although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy in  there was a rift between smith and oliver cowdery over the issue cowdery suspected smith had engaged in a relationship with his serving girl fanny alger smith never denied a relationship but insisted it was not adulterous presumably because he had taken alger as a plural wife in april  smith wed louisa beaman during the next twoandahalf years he married or was sealed to about  additional women ten of whom were already married to other men some of these polyandrous marriages were done with the consent of the first husbands and some plural marriages may have been considered eternityonly sealings ten of smiths plural wives were between the ages of fourteen and twenty others were over fifty the practice of polygamy was kept secret from both nonmormons and most members of the church during smiths lifetime polygamy caused a breach between smith and his first wife emma although emma knew of some of her husbands marriages she almost certainly did not know the extent of his polygamous activities in  emma temporarily accepted smiths marriage to four women boarded in the smith household but soon regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave in july  smith

message while campaigning for president of the united states in  smith had opportunity to take political positions on issues of the day smith considered the us constitution and especially the bill of rights to be inspired by god and the latter day saints best and perhaps only defense he believed a strong central government was crucial to the nations wellbeing and thought democracy better than tyranny—although he also taught that a theocratic monarchy was the ideal form of government in foreign affairs smith was an expansionist though he viewed expansionism as brotherhood smith favored a strong central bank and high tariffs to protect american business and agriculture he disfavored imprisonment of convicts except for murder preferring efforts to reform criminals through labor he also opposed courtsmartial for military deserters he supported capital punishment but opposed hanging preferring execution by firing squad or beheading on the issue of slavery smith took different positions initially he opposed it but during the mids when the mormons were settling in missouri a slave state smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly antiabolitionist essay then in the early s after mormons had been expelled from missouri he once again opposed slavery during his presidential campaign of  he proposed ending slavery by  and compensating slaveholders for their loss smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites and he welcomed slaves into the church however he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters and he opposed interracial marriage smith declared that he would be one of the instruments in fulfilling nebuchadnezzars statue vision in the book of daniel that secular government would be destroyed without sword or gun and would be replaced with a theodemocratic kingdom of god smith taught that this kingdom would be governed by theocratic principles but that it would also be multidenominational and democratic so long as the people chose wisely ethics and behavioredit a succinct statement of ethics by smith is found in his th article of faith we believe in being honest true chaste benevolent virtuous and in doing good to all men indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of paul—we believe all things we hope all things we have endured many things and hope to be able to endure all things if there is anything virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy we seek after these things smith said his ethical rule was when the lord commands do it he also taught that which is wrong under one circumstance may be and often is right under another god said thou shalt not kill—at another time he said thou shalt utterly destroy this is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted—by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the elders of the kingdom are placed whatever god requires is right  even things which may be considered abominable to all those who do not understand the order of heaven beginning in the mids and into the s as the mormon people became involved in conflicts with the missouri and illinois state governments smith taught that congress has no power to make a law that would abridge the rights of my religion and that they were not under the obligation to follow laws they deemed as being contrary to their religious privilege smith may have thus felt justified in

mormonism and the latter day saint movement when he was twentyfour smith published the book of mormon by the time of his death fourteen years later he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religious culture that continues to the present smith was born in sharon vermont by  he had moved with his family to what became known as the burnedover district of western new york an area of intense religious revivalism during the second great awakening according to smith he experienced a series of visions including one in which he saw two personages presumably god the father and jesus christ and others in which an angel directed him to a buried book of golden plates inscribed with a judeochristian history of an ancient american civilization in  smith published what he said was an english translation of these plates the book of mormon the same year he organized the church of christ calling it a restoration of the early christian church members of the church were later called latter day saints or mormons and in  smith announced a revelation that renamed the church as the church of jesus christ of latter day saints in  smith and his followers moved west planning to build a communalistic american zion they first gathered in kirtland ohio and established an outpost in independence missouri which was intended to be zions center place during the s smith sent out missionaries published revelations and supervised construction of the expensive kirtland temple the collapse of the churchsponsored kirtland safety society and violent skirmishes with nonmormon missourians caused smith and his followers to establish a new settlement at nauvoo illinois where he became a spiritual and political leader in  smith and the nauvoo city council angered nonmormons by destroying a newspaper that had criticized smiths power and practice of polygamy after smith was imprisoned in carthage illinois he was killed when a mob stormed the jailhouse smith published many revelations and other texts that his followers regard as scripture his teachings include unique views about the nature of god cosmology family structures political organization and religious

jr was born on december   in sharon vermont to lucy mack smith and her husband joseph sr a merchant and farmer after suffering a crippling bone infection when he was seven the younger smith used crutches for three years in – after an illfated business venture and three years of crop failures the smith family moved to the western new york village of palmyra and eventually took a mortgage on a acre  ha farm in the nearby town of manchester during the second great awakening the region was a hotbed of religious enthusiasm and between  and  there were several camp meetings and revivals in the palmyra area although smiths parents disagreed about religion the family was caught up in this excitement smith later said he became interested in religion at about the age of twelve he participated in church classes and read the bible as a teenager he may have been sympathetic to methodism with other family members smith also engaged in religious folk magic not an uncommon practice at the time both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from god smith said that although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations years later smith said that in  he had received a vision that resolved his religious confusion while praying in a wooded area near his home he said that god in a vision had told him his sins were forgiven and that all contemporary churches had turned aside from the gospel smith said he told the experience to a preacher who dismissed the story with contempt but the experience was largely unknown even to most mormons until the s although smith may have understood the event as a personal conversion this first vision later grew in importance among mormons who today see it as the first event in the restoration of the gospel smith said he received golden plates from the angel moroni at the hill cumorah smith said that in  while praying one night for forgiveness from his sins he was visited by an angel named moroni who revealed the location of a buried book made of golden plates as well as other artifacts including a breastplate and a set of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame which had been hidden in a hill in manchester near his home smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning but was unsuccessful because the angel prevented him smith reported that during the next four years he made annual visits to the hill but each time returned without the plates meanwhile the smith family faced financial hardship due in part to the november  death of smiths oldest brother alvin who had assumed a leadership role in the family family members supplemented their meager farm income by hiring out for odd jobs and working as treasure seekers a type of magical supernaturalism common during the period smith was said to have an ability to locate lost items by looking into a seer stone which he also used in treasure hunting including several unsuccessful attempts to find buried treasure sponsored by a wealthy farmer in chenango county new york in  smith was brought before a chenango county court for glasslooking or pretending to find lost treasure the result of the proceeding remains unclear as primary sources report various conflicting outcomes while boarding at the hale house in harmony pennsylvania smith began courting emma hale when smith proposed marriage emmas father isaac hale objected because smith was a stranger who had no means of supporting his daughter other than money digging of which he disapproved smith and emma eloped and married on january   after which the couple began boarding with smiths parents in manchester later that year when smith promised to abandon treasure seeking hale offered to let the couple live on his property in harmony and help smith get started in business smith said that he made his last annual visit to the hill on september   taking emma with him this time he said he retrieved the plates and put them in a locked chest he said the angel commanded him not to show the plates to anyone else but to publish their translation reputed to be the religious record of indigenous americans smith said that the plates were engraved in an unknown language reformed egyptian and he told associates that he was capable of reading and translating them although smith had left his treasure hunting company his former associates believed he had doublecrossed them by taking for himself what they considered joint property after they ransacked places where a competing treasureseer said the plates were hidden smith decided to leave palmyra founding a church –edit main article life of joseph smith from  to  in october  smith and his pregnant wife moved from palmyra to harmony now oakland pennsylvania aided by money from a relatively prosperous neighbor martin harris living near his inlaws smith transcribed some characters that he said were engraved on the plates and then dictated a translation to his wife in february  martin harris arrived to assist smith by transcribing his dictation harris also took a sample of the characters to a few prominent scholars including charles anthon who harris said initially authenticated the characters and their translation but then retracted his opinion after learning that smith was supposed to have received the plates from an angel anthon denied harriss account of the meeting claiming instead that he had tried to convince harris that he had been the victim of a fraud nevertheless harris returned to harmony in april  encouraged to continue as smiths scribe smith continued to dictate to harris until midjune  when harris began having doubts about the project fueled in part by his wifes skepticism harris convinced smith to let him take the existing  pages of manuscript to palmyra to show a few family members including his wife harris lost the manuscript—of which there was no other copy—at about the same time smiths wife emma gave birth to a son alvin who died the same day smith said that as punishment for losing the manuscript the angel took away the plates and revoked his ability to translate during this dark period smith briefly attended methodist meetings with his wife until a cousin of hers objected to inclusion of a practicing necromancer on the methodist class roll cover page of the book of mormon original  edition smith said that the angel returned the plates to him on september   and he resumed dictation in april  after he met oliver cowdery who replaced harris as his scribe they worked full time on the manuscript between april and early june  and then moved to fayette new york where they continued to work at the home of cowderys friend peter whitmer when the narrative described an institutional church and a requirement for baptism smith and cowdery baptized each other dictation was completed around july   although smith had previously refused to show the plates to anyone he told martin harris oliver cowdery and david whitmer that they would be allowed to see them these men known collectively as the three witnesses—along with a later group of eight witnesses composed of male members of the whitmer and smith families—signed statements testifying that they had seen the golden plates statements were issued by both the three witnesses and the eight witnesses the primary distinction between the two groups were that the three witnesses stated that an angel showed them the plates and the voice of god confirmed their truth while the eight witnesses where shown the plates by smith according to smith the angel moroni took back the plates once smith finished using them the completed work the book of mormon was published in palmyra on march   by printer e b grandin martin harris having mortgaged his farm to finance it soon after on april   smith and his followers formally organized the church of christ and small branches were established in palmyra fayette and colesville new york the book of mormon brought smith regional notoriety and opposition from those who remembered his moneydigging and the  chenango county trial after cowdery baptized several new members the mormons received threats of mob violence and before smith could confirm the newly baptized members he was arrested and brought to trial as a disorderly person he was acquitted but both he and cowdery had to flee colesville to escape a gathering mob in probable reference to this period of flight smith said that peter james and john had appeared to him and had ordained him and cowdery to a higher priesthood smiths authority was undermined when oliver cowdery hiram page and other church members also claimed to receive revelations in response smith dictated a revelation which clarified his office as a prophet and an apostle and which declared that only he held the keys of the mysteries and the revelations with the ability to inscribe scripture for the church shortly after the conference smith dispatched cowdery peter whitmer and others on a mission to proselytize native americans cowdery was also assigned the task of locating the site of the new jerusalem on their way to missouri cowderys party passed through northeastern ohio where sidney rigdon and over a hundred followers of his variety of campbellite restorationism converted to mormonism more than doubling the size of the church rigdon soon visited new york and quickly became smiths primary assistant with growing opposition in new york smith gave forth as revelation that kirtland was the eastern boundary of the new jerusalem and that his followers must gather there life in ohio –edit main articles life of joseph smith from  to  and life of joseph smith from  to  when smith moved to kirtland ohio in january  he encountered a religious culture that included enthusiastic demonstrations of spiritual gifts including fits and trances rolling on the ground and speaking in tongues smith tamed these outbursts by producing two revelations that brought the kirtland congregation under his own authority rigdons followers had also been practicing a form of communalism and this smith adopted calling it the united order smith had promised church elders that in kirtland they would receive an endowment of heavenly power and at the june  general conference he introduced the greater authority of a high melchizedek priesthood to the church hierarchy a mob tarred and feathered smith in  converts poured into kirtland by the summer of  there were fifteen hundred to two thousand mormons in the vicinity many expecting smith to lead them shortly to the millennial kingdom though the mission to the indians had been a failure the missionaries sent on their way by a government indian agent cowdery reported that he had found the site of the new jerusalem in jackson county missouri after smith visited in july  he agreed pronouncing the frontier hamlet of independence the center place of zion nevertheless rigdon disapproved and for most of the s the church remained divided between ohio and missouri smith continued to live in ohio but visited missouri again in early  in order to prevent a rebellion of prominent church members including cowdery who believed the church in missouri was being neglected smiths trip was hastened by a mob of ohio residents who were incensed over the united order and smiths political power the mob beat smith and rigdon unconscious tarred and feathered them and left them for dead in jackson county missouri residents resented the mormon newcomers for both political and religious reasons tension increased until july  when nonmormons forcibly evicted the mormons and destroyed their property smith advised them to bear the violence patiently until they were attacked a fourth time after which they could fight back after armed bands exchanged fire and one mormon and two nonmormons were killed the old settlers brutally expelled the mormons from the county smith ended the communitarian experiment and changed the name of the church to the church of latter day saints before leading a small paramilitary expedition later called zions camp to aid the missouri mormons as a military endeavor the expedition was a failure the men were outnumbered and suffered from dissension and a cholera outbreak nevertheless zions camp transformed mormon leadership and many future church leaders came from among the participants after the camp returned smith drew heavily from its participants to establish five governing bodies in the church all originally of equal authority to check one another among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles smith gave a revelation saying that to redeem zion his followers would have to receive an endowment in the kirtland temple and in march  at the temples dedication many participants in the promised endowment saw visions of angels spoke in tongues and prophesied smith dedicated the kirtland temple in  in late  a series of internal disputes led to the collapse of the kirtland mormon community smith was blamed for having promoted a churchsponsored bank that failed and accused of engaging in a sexual relationship with his serving girl fanny alger building the temple had left the church deeply in debt and smith was hounded by creditors having heard of a large sum of money supposedly hidden in salem massachusetts smith traveled there and received a revelation that god had much treasure in this city but after a month he returned to kirtland emptyhanded in january  smith and other church leaders created a joint stock company called the kirtland safety society to act as a quasibank the company issued bank notes capitalized in part by real estate smith encouraged the latter day saints to buy the notes and he invested heavily in them himself but the bank failed within a month as a result the latter day saints in kirtland suffered intense pressure from debt collectors and severe price volatility smith was held responsible for the failure and there were widespread defections from the church including many of smiths closest advisers after a warrant was issued for smiths arrest on a charge of banking fraud smith and rigdon fled kirtland for missouri on the night of january   life in missouri –edit main articles life of joseph smith from  to  and  mormon war by  smith had abandoned plans to redeem zion in jackson county and after smith and rigdon arrived in missouri the town of far west became the new zion in missouri the church also took the name church of jesus christ of latter day saints and construction began on a new temple in the weeks and months after smith and rigdon arrived at far west thousands of latter day saints followed them from kirtland smith encouraged the settlement of land outside caldwell county instituting a settlement in adamondiahman in daviess county during this time

these men who were known collectively as the dissenters political and religious differences between old missourians and newlyarriving mormon settlers provoked tensions between the two groups much as

activities he clearly approved of those of which he did know after rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had no place in the mormon community the danites forcibly expelled them from the county in an oration given at the towns fourth of july celebration rigdon declared that mormons would no longer tolerate persecution by the missourians and spoke of a war of extermination if mormons were attacked smith implicitly endorsed this speech and many nonmormons understood it to be a thinlyveiled threat they unleashed a flood of antimormon rhetoric in newspapers and in stump speeches

an unusually liberal charter for the new city which smith named nauvoo hebrew נָאווּ meaning to be beautiful the charter granted the city virtual autonomy authorized a university and granted nauvoo habeas corpus power—which allowed smith to fend off extradition to missouri though mormon authorities controlled nauvoos civil government the city promised an unusually liberal guarantee of religious freedom the charter also authorized the nauvoo legion an autonomous militia whose actions were limited only by state and federal constitutions lieutenant general smith and major general bennett became its commanders thereby controlling by far the largest body of armed men in illinois smith made bennett assistant president of the church and bennett was elected nauvoos first mayor in  smith began

was later tried and acquitted in june  enemies of smith convinced a reluctant illinois governor thomas ford to extradite smith to missouri on the old charge of treason two law officers arrested smith but were intercepted by a party of mormons before they could reach missouri smith was then released on a writ of habeas corpus from the nauvoo municipal court while this ended the missourians attempts at extradition it caused significant political fallout in illinois in december  smith petitioned congress to make nauvoo an independent territory with the right to call out federal troops in its defense smith then wrote to the leading presidential candidates and asked them what they would do to protect the mormons after receiving noncommittal or negative responses smith announced his own thirdparty candidacy for president of the united states suspended regular proselytizing and sent out the quorum of the twelve and hundreds of other political missionaries in march  following a dispute

excommunicated them on april   these dissidents formed a competing church and the following month at carthage the county seat they procured indictments against smith for perjury and polygamy on june  the dissidents published the first and only issue of the nauvoo expositor calling for reform within the church and appealing to the political views of the countys antimormons the paper decried smiths new doctrines of many gods alluded to smiths theocratic aspirations and called for a repeal of the nauvoo city charter it also attacked smiths practice of polygamy implying that smith was using religion as a pretext to draw unassuming women to nauvoo in order to seduce and marry them fearing the newspaper would bring the countryside down on the mormons the nauvoo city council declared the expositor a public nuisance and ordered the nauvoo legion to destroy the press smith who feared another mob attack supported the action not realizing that destroying a newspaper was more likely to incite an attack than any libel smith was shot multiple times before and after falling from the window destruction of the newspaper provoked a strident call to arms from thomas c sharp editor of the warsaw signal and longtime critic of smith fearing an uprising smith mobilized the nauvoo legion on june  and declared martial law officials in carthage responded by mobilizing their small detachment

acquitted smith was buried in nauvoo and is interred there at the smith family cemetery throughout his life smith had been sharply criticized by newspaper editors and after his death newspapers were almost unanimous in portraying smith as a religious fanatic conversely within mormonism smith was memorialized first and foremost as a prophet martyred to seal the testimony of his faith legacyedit impactedit smith attracted thousands of devoted followers before his death in  and millions in the century that followed among mormons he is regarded as a prophet on par with moses and elijah in a  compilation of the  most significant americans of all time smithsonian magazine ranked smith first in the category of religious figures mormons and exmormons have produced a large amount of scholarly work about smith and to a large extent the result has been two discordant pictures of very different people a man of god on the one hand and on the other a fraud preying on the ignorance of his followers believers tended to focus on his achievements and religious teachings deemphasizing his personal defects while detractors focused on his mistakes legal troubles and controversial doctrines during the first half of the th century some writers suggested that smith might have suffered from epileptic seizures or from psychological disorders such as paranoid delusions or manicdepressive illness that might explain his visions and revelations many modern biographers disagree with these ideas more nuanced interpretations range from viewing smith as a prophet who had normal human weaknesses a pious fraud who believed he was called of god to preach repentance and felt justified inventing visions in order to convert people or a gifted mythmaker who was the product of his yankee environment biographers mormon and nonmormon agree that smith was one of the most influential charismatic and innovative figures in american religious history buildings named in honor of smith the

following smiths sons joseph iii and david also had claims but joseph iii was too young and david was yet unborn the council of fifty had a theoretical claim to succession but it was a secret organization some of smiths chosen successors such as oliver cowdery and david whitmer had left the church the two strongest succession candidates were brigham young senior member and president of the

other than emma throughout her life emma smith frequently denied that her husband had ever taken additional wives emma said that the very first time she ever became aware of a polygamy revelation being attributed to smith by mormons was when she read about it in orson pratts periodical the seer in  emma campaigned publicly against polygamy and was the main signatory of a petition in  with a thousand female signatures denying that smith was connected with polygamy as president of the ladies relief society emma authorized publishing a certificate in the same year denouncing polygamy and

from brigham young and the church leadership young whom emma feared and despised was suspicious of her desire to preserve the familys assets from inclusion with those of the church and thought she

belief in the authenticity of the book of mormon revelationsedit an artistic representation of the golden plates with the urim and thummim connected to a breastplate based on descriptions by smith and others according to richard bushman the signal feature of smiths life was his sense of being guided by revelation instead of presenting ideas with logical arguments smith dictated authoritative revelations and let people decide whether to believe smiths teachings came primarily through his revelations which read like scripture oracular and open to interpretation smith and his followers viewed his revelations as being above teachings or opinions and smiths actions seemed to indicate that he believed in his revelations as much as his most loyal followers smiths first recorded revelation was a rebuke from god for having let martin harris lose  pages of book of mormon manuscript chastising him for fearing man more than god the revelation was given in the voice of god rather than as a declaration mediated through smith and subsequent revelations assumed a similar authoritative style often opening with words such as hearken o ye people which profess my name saith the lord your god book of mormonedit main article book of mormon the book of mormon has been called the longest and most complex of smiths revelations it is organized as a compilation of smaller books each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader it tells the story of the rise and fall of a religious civilization beginning around  bc and ending in  ad the story begins with a family that leaves jerusalem just before the babylonian captivity they eventually construct a ship and sail to a promised land in the western hemisphere there they are divided into two factions nephites and lamanites the nephites become a righteous people who build a temple and live the law of moses though their prophets teach a christian gospel the book explains itself to be largely the work of mormon a nephite prophet and military figure the book closes when mormons son moroni finishes engraving and buries the records written on the golden plates christian themes permeate the work for instance nephite prophets in the book of mormon teach of christs coming and talk of the star that will appear at his birth after the crucifixion and resurrection in jerusalem jesus appears in the americas repeats the sermon on the mount blesses children and appoints twelve disciples the book ends with moronis exhortation to come unto christ early mormons understood the book of mormon to be a religious history of the indigenous peoples of the americas smiths followers view it as a companion to the bible and an additional witness of christ akin to a large apocryphal work modern historian fawn brodie has called the book of mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of smiths times saying that smith composed the book of mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him dan vogel another historian says that the work is autobiographical in nature according to some accounts smith dictated most of the book of mormon by looking into a seer stone placed in a stovepipe hat smith never said how he produced the book of mormon saying only that he translated by the power of god and implying that he had transcribed the words the book of mormon itself states only that its text will come forth by the gift and power of god unto the interpretation thereof as such considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists for at least some of the earliest dictation smith is said to have used the urim and thummim a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates later however he is said to have used a chocolatecolored stone he had found in  that he had used previously for treasure hunting joseph knight said that smith saw the words of the translation while he gazed at the stone or stones in the bottom of his hat excluding all light a process similar to divining the location of treasure sometimes smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table after completing the translation smith gave the brown stone to cowdery but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about  when he said he no longer needed it although the book of mormon drew many converts to the church fawn brodie argued in  that the book lives today because of the prophet not he because of the book smith had assumed a role as prophet seer and apostle of jesus christ and by early  he was introducing himself as joseph the prophet the language of authority in smiths revelations was appealing to converts and the revelations were given with the confidence of an old testament prophet moses and abrahamedit main articles book of abraham and book of moses smith said that in june  he received a revelation of moses in which moses saw the world and the ends thereof and asked god questions about the purpose of creation and mans relationship to god this revelation initiated a revision of the bible on which smith worked sporadically until  and which remained unpublished at his death smith said that he believed the bible had been corrupted through the ages and that his revision worked to restore the original intent it added long passages rewritten according to his inspiration while many changes involved straightening out seeming contradictions or making small clarifications other changes added large lost portions to the text for instance smiths revision nearly tripled the length of the first five chapters of genesis in what would become the book of moses the book of moses begins with moses inquiring of god as to the purpose of creation and is told in this account that god made the earth and heavens to bring humans to eternal life the book also provides an enlarged account of the genesis creation narrative and expands the story of enoch the ancestor of noah in the narrative enoch speaks with god receives a prophetic calling and eventually builds a city of zion so righteous that it was taken to heaven the book also elaborates and expands upon foreshadowing and types of christ in effect christianizing the old testament in  smith encouraged some latter day saints in kirtland to purchase rolls of ancient egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor over the next several years smith worked off and on as events allowed to produce a supposed translation of one of these rolls which he published in  as the book of abraham the book of abraham speaks of the founding of the abrahamic nation astronomy cosmology lineage and priesthood and gave another account of the creation story the papyri from which smith dictated the book of abraham were thought to have been lost in the great chicago fire but several fragments were rediscovered in the s were translated by egyptologists and were determined to be part of the book of the dead with no connection to abraham other revelationsedit see also book of commandments and doctrine and covenants the holy spirit may give you sudden strokes of ideas so

smith dictated revelations orally and they were recorded by a scribe without revisions or corrections revelations were immediately copied and then circulated among church members smiths revelations often came in response to specific questions he described the revelatory process as having pure intelligence flowing into him smith however never viewed the wording to be infallible the revelations were not gods words verbatim but couched in language suitable to josephs time in  smith edited and expanded many of the previous revelations publishing them as the book of commandments which later became part of the doctrine and covenants smith gave varying types of revelations some were temporal while others were spiritual or doctrinal some were received for a specific individual while others were directed at the whole church notable revelations include an  revelation called the law containing directions for missionary work rules for organizing society in zion a reiteration of the ten commandments an injunction to administer to the poor and needy and an outline for the law of consecration an  revelation called the vision added to the fundamentals of sin and atonement introduced doctrines of life after salvation the theme of exaltation and a heaven with degrees of glory another  revelation on priesthood was the first to explain priesthood doctrine three months later smith gave a lengthy revelation called the olive leaf containing themes of cosmology and eschatology and discussing subjects such as light truth intelligence and sanctification a related revelation given in  put christ at the center of salvation also in  at a time of temperance agitation smith delivered a revelation called the word of wisdom which counseled a diet of wholesome herbs fruits grains a sparing use of meat and recommended that latter day saints avoid strong alcoholic drinks tobacco and hot drinks later interpreted to mean tea and coffee the word of wisdom was not originally framed as a commandment but a recommendation as such smith and other latter day saints did not strictly follow this counsel though it later became a requirement in the lds church in  smith gave the great revelation that organized the priesthood into quorums and councils and served as a complex blueprint for church structure smiths last revelation on the new and everlasting covenant was recorded in  and dealt with the theology of family the doctrine of sealing and plural marriage before  most of smiths revelations dealt with establishing the church gathering his followers and building the city of zion while later revelations dealt with the priesthood endowment and exaltation the revelations slowed in kirtland during the autumn of  and again after the dedication of the kirtland temple as smith relied more heavily on his own teachings smith moved away from written revelations opening with verily thus saith the lord and taught more in sermons conversations and letters for instance the doctrines of baptism for the dead and the nature of god were introduced in sermons and one of smiths most famed statements about there being no such thing as immaterial matter was recorded from a casual conversation with a methodist preacher views and teachingsedit main article teachings of joseph smith smiths later theology described jesus and god the father as two distinct physical beings cosmology and theologyedit see also mormon cosmology and godhead latter day saints smith taught that all existence was material including a world of spirit matter so fine that it was invisible to all but the purest mortal eyes matter in smiths view could neither be created nor destroyed the creation involved only the reorganization of existing matter like matter smith saw intelligence as coeternal with god and taught that human spirits had been drawn from a preexistent pool of eternal intelligences nevertheless spirits could not experience a fullness of joy unless joined with corporeal bodies according to smith the work and glory of god then was to create worlds across the cosmos where inferior intelligences could be embodied though smith initially viewed god the father as a spirit he eventually began teaching that god was an advanced and glorified man embodied within time and space by the end of his life smith was teaching that both god the father and jesus were distinct beings with physical bodies but the holy spirit was a personage of spirit through the gradual acquisition of knowledge according to smith those who received exaltation could eventually become like god these teachings implied a vast hierarchy of gods with god himself having a father in smiths cosmology those who became gods would reign unified in purpose and will leading spirits of lesser capacity to share immortality and eternal life in smiths view the opportunity to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation apart from those who committed the eternal sin smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife religious authority and ritualedit see also priesthood latter day saints freemasonry and the latter day saint movement and endowment latter day saints smiths teachings were rooted in dispensational restorationism he taught that the church of christ restored through him was a latterday restoration of the early christian faith which had been lost in the great apostasy at first smiths church had little sense of hierarchy his religious authority was derived from visions and revelations though smith did not claim exclusive prophethood an early revelation designated him as the only prophet allowed to issue commandments as moses this religious authority encompassed economic and political as well as spiritual matters for instance in the early s he temporarily instituted a form of religious communism called the united order that required latter day saints to give all their property to the church which was divided among the faithful he also envisioned that the theocratic institutions he established would have a role in the worldwide political organization of the millennium by the mids smith began teaching a hierarchy of three priesthoods—the melchizedek the aaronic and the patriarchal each priesthood was a continuation of biblical priesthoods through patrilineal succession or ordination by biblical figures appearing in visions upon introducing the melchizedek or high priesthood in  smith taught that its recipients would be endowed with power from on high thus fulfilling a need for a greater holiness and an authority commensurate with the new testament apostles this doctrine of endowment evolved through the s until in  the nauvoo endowment included an elaborate ceremony containing elements similar to freemasonry and the jewish tradition of kabbalah the endowment was extended to women in  though smith never clarified whether women could be ordained to priesthood offices smith taught that the high priesthoods endowment of heavenly power included the sealing powers of elijah allowing high priests to effect binding consequences in the afterlife for example this power would enable proxy baptisms for the dead and priesthood marriages that would be effective into the afterlife elijahs sealing powers also enabled the second anointing or fulness sic of the priesthood which according to smith sealed married couples to their exaltation theology of familyedit during the early s smith unfolded a theology of family relations called the new and everlasting covenant that superseded all earthly bonds he taught that outside the covenant marriages were simply matters of contract and that in the afterlife individuals married outside the covenant or not married would be limited in their progression to fully enter the covenant a man and woman must participate in a first anointing a sealing ceremony and a second anointing also called sealing by the holy spirit of promise when fully sealed into the covenant smith said that no sin nor blasphemy other than the eternal sin could keep them from their exaltation in the afterlife according to smith only one person on earth at a time—in this case smith—could possess this power of sealing a painting of smith by bathsheba w smith created circa  smith taught that the highest level of exaltation could be achieved through plural marriage polygamy which was the ultimate manifestation of this new and everlasting covenant plural marriage according to smith allowed an individual to transcend the angelic state and become a god accelerating the expansion of ones heavenly kingdom polygamyedit see also origin of latter day saint polygamy and mormonism and polygamy smith had by some accounts been teaching a polygamy doctrine as early as  and there is unconfirmed evidence that smith was a polygamist by  although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy in  there was a rift between smith and oliver cowdery over the issue cowdery suspected smith had engaged in a relationship with his serving girl fanny alger smith never denied a relationship but insisted it was not adulterous presumably because he had taken alger as a plural wife in april  smith wed louisa beaman during the next twoandahalf years he married or was sealed to about  additional women ten of whom were already married to other men some of these polyandrous marriages were done with the consent of the first husbands and some plural marriages may have been considered eternityonly sealings ten of smiths plural wives were between the ages of fourteen and twenty others were over fifty the practice of polygamy was kept secret from both nonmormons and most members of the church during smiths lifetime polygamy caused a breach between smith and his first wife emma although emma knew of some of her husbands marriages she almost certainly did not know the extent of his polygamous activities in  emma temporarily accepted smiths marriage to four women boarded in the smith household but soon regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave in july  smith

rights to be inspired by god and the latter day saints best and perhaps only defense he believed a strong central government was crucial to the nations wellbeing and thought democracy better than tyranny—although he also taught that a theocratic monarchy was the ideal form of government in foreign affairs smith was an expansionist though he viewed expansionism as brotherhood smith favored a strong central bank and high tariffs to protect american business and agriculture he disfavored imprisonment of convicts except for murder preferring efforts to reform criminals through labor he also opposed courtsmartial for military deserters he supported capital punishment but opposed hanging preferring execution by firing squad or beheading on the issue of slavery smith took different positions initially he opposed it but during the mids when the mormons were settling in missouri a slave state smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly antiabolitionist essay then in the early s after mormons had been expelled from missouri he once again opposed slavery during his presidential campaign of  he proposed ending slavery by  and compensating slaveholders for their loss smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites and he welcomed slaves into the church however he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters and he opposed interracial marriage smith declared that he would be one of the instruments in fulfilling nebuchadnezzars statue vision in the book of daniel that secular government would be destroyed without sword or gun and would be replaced with a theodemocratic kingdom of god smith taught that this kingdom would be governed by theocratic principles but that it would also be multidenominational and democratic so long as the people chose wisely ethics and behavioredit a succinct statement of ethics by smith is found in his th article of faith we believe in being honest true chaste benevolent virtuous and in doing good to all men indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of paul—we believe all things we hope all things we have endured many things and hope to be able to endure all things if there is anything virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy we seek after these things smith said his ethical rule was when the lord commands do it he also taught that which is wrong under one circumstance may be and often is right under another god said thou shalt not kill—at another time he said thou shalt utterly destroy this is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted—by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the elders of the kingdom are placed whatever god requires is right  even things which may be considered abominable to all those who do not understand the order of heaven beginning in the mids and into the s as the mormon people became involved in conflicts with the missouri and illinois state governments smith taught that congress has no power to make a law that would abridge the rights of my religion and that they were not under the obligation to follow laws they deemed as being contrary to their religious privilege smith may have thus felt justified in

mormonism and the latter day saint movement when he was twentyfour smith published the book of mormon by the time of his death fourteen years later he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religious culture that continues to the present smith was born in sharon vermont by  he had moved with his family to what became known as the burnedover district of western new york an area of intense religious revivalism during the second great awakening according to smith he experienced a series of visions including one in which he saw two personages presumably god the father and jesus christ and others in which an angel directed him to a buried book of golden plates inscribed with a judeochristian history of an ancient american civilization in  smith published what he said was an english translation of these plates the book of mormon the same year he organized the church of christ calling it a restoration of the early christian church members of the church were later called latter day saints or mormons and in  smith announced a revelation that renamed the church as the church of jesus christ of latter day saints in  smith and his followers moved west planning to build a communalistic american zion they first gathered in kirtland ohio and established an outpost in independence missouri which was intended to be zions center place during the s smith sent out missionaries published revelations and supervised construction of the expensive kirtland temple the collapse of the churchsponsored kirtland safety society and violent skirmishes with nonmormon missourians caused smith and his followers to establish a new settlement at nauvoo illinois where he became a spiritual and political leader in  smith and the nauvoo city council angered nonmormons by

jr was born on december   in sharon vermont to lucy mack smith and her husband joseph sr a merchant and farmer after suffering a crippling bone infection when he was seven the younger smith used crutches for three years in – after an illfated business venture and three years of crop failures the smith family moved to the western new york village of palmyra and eventually took a mortgage on a acre  ha farm in the nearby town of manchester during the second great awakening the region was a hotbed of religious enthusiasm and between  and  there were several camp meetings and revivals in the palmyra area although smiths parents disagreed about religion the family was caught up in this excitement smith later said he became interested in religion at about the age of twelve he participated in church classes and read the bible as a teenager he may have been sympathetic to methodism with other family members smith also engaged in religious folk magic not an uncommon practice at the time both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from god smith said that although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations years later smith said that in  he had received a vision that resolved his religious confusion while praying in a wooded area near his home he said that god in a vision had told him his sins were forgiven and that all contemporary churches had turned aside from the gospel smith said he told the experience to a preacher who dismissed the story with contempt but the experience was largely unknown even to most mormons until the s although smith may have understood the event as a personal conversion this first vision later grew in importance among mormons who today see it as the first event in the restoration of the gospel smith said he received golden plates from the angel moroni at the hill cumorah smith said that in  while praying one night for forgiveness from his sins he was visited by an angel named moroni who revealed the location of a buried book made of golden plates as well as other artifacts including a breastplate and a set of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame which had been hidden in a hill in manchester near his home smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning but was unsuccessful because the angel prevented him smith reported that during the next four years he made annual visits to the hill but each time returned without the plates meanwhile the smith family faced financial hardship due in part to the november  death of smiths oldest brother alvin who had assumed a leadership role in the family family members supplemented their meager farm income by hiring out for odd jobs and working as treasure seekers a type of magical supernaturalism common during the period smith was said to have an ability to locate lost items by looking into a seer stone which he also used in treasure hunting including several unsuccessful attempts to find buried treasure sponsored by a wealthy farmer in chenango county new york in  smith was brought before a chenango county court for glasslooking or pretending to find lost treasure the result of the proceeding remains unclear as primary sources report various conflicting outcomes while boarding at the hale house in harmony pennsylvania smith began courting emma hale when smith proposed marriage emmas father isaac hale objected because smith was a stranger who had no means of supporting his daughter other than money digging of which he disapproved smith and emma eloped and married on january   after which the couple began boarding with smiths parents in manchester later that year when smith promised to abandon treasure seeking hale offered to let the couple live on his property in harmony and help smith get started in business smith said that he made his last annual visit to the hill on september   taking emma with him this time he said he retrieved the plates and put them in a locked chest he said the angel commanded him not to show the plates to anyone else but to publish their translation reputed to be the religious record of indigenous americans smith said that the plates were engraved in an unknown language reformed egyptian and he told associates that he was capable of reading and translating them although smith had left his treasure hunting company his former associates believed he had doublecrossed them by taking for himself what they considered joint property after they ransacked places where a competing treasureseer said the plates were hidden smith decided to leave palmyra founding a church –edit main article life of joseph smith from  to  in october  smith and his pregnant wife moved from palmyra to harmony now oakland pennsylvania aided by money from a relatively prosperous neighbor martin harris living near his inlaws smith transcribed some characters that he said were engraved on the plates and then dictated a translation to his wife in february  martin harris arrived to assist smith by transcribing his dictation harris also took a sample of the characters to a few prominent scholars including charles anthon who harris said initially authenticated the characters and their translation but then retracted his opinion after learning that smith was supposed to have received the plates from an angel anthon denied harriss account of the meeting claiming instead that he had tried to convince harris that he had been the victim of a fraud nevertheless harris returned to harmony in april  encouraged to continue as smiths scribe smith continued to dictate to harris until midjune  when harris began having doubts about the project fueled in part by his wifes skepticism harris convinced smith to let him take the existing  pages of manuscript to palmyra to show a few family members including his wife harris lost the manuscript—of which there was no other copy—at about the same time smiths wife emma gave birth to a son alvin who died the same day smith said that as punishment for losing the manuscript the angel took away the plates and revoked his ability to translate during this dark period smith briefly attended methodist meetings with his wife until a cousin of hers objected to inclusion of a practicing necromancer on the methodist class roll cover page of the book of mormon original  edition smith said that the angel returned the plates to him on september   and he resumed dictation in april  after he met oliver cowdery who replaced harris as his scribe they worked full time on the manuscript between april and early june  and then moved to fayette new york where they continued to work at the home of cowderys friend peter whitmer when the narrative described an institutional church and a requirement for baptism smith and cowdery baptized each other dictation was completed around july   although smith had previously refused to show the plates to anyone he told martin harris oliver cowdery and david whitmer that they would be allowed to see them these men known collectively as the three witnesses—along with a later group of eight witnesses composed of male members of the whitmer and smith families—signed statements testifying that they had seen the golden plates statements were issued by both the three witnesses and the eight witnesses the primary distinction between the two groups were that the three witnesses stated that an angel showed them the plates and the voice of god

compilation of the  most significant americans of all time smithsonian magazine ranked smith first in the category of religious figures mormons and exmormons have produced a large amount of scholarly work about smith and to a large extent the result has been two discordant pictures of very different people a man of god on the one hand and on the other a fraud preying on the ignorance of his followers believers tended to focus on his achievements and religious teachings deemphasizing his personal defects while detractors focused on his mistakes legal troubles and controversial doctrines during the first half of the th century some writers suggested that smith might have suffered from epileptic seizures or from psychological disorders such as paranoid delusions or manicdepressive illness that might explain his visions and revelations many modern biographers disagree with these ideas more nuanced interpretations range from viewing smith as a prophet who had normal human weaknesses a pious fraud who believed he was called of god to preach repentance and felt justified inventing visions in order to convert people or a gifted mythmaker who was the product of his yankee environment biographers mormon and nonmormon agree that smith was one of the most influential charismatic and innovative figures in american religious history buildings named in honor of smith the

revelations and let people decide whether to believe smiths teachings came primarily through his revelations which read like scripture oracular and open to interpretation smith and his followers viewed his revelations as being above teachings or opinions and smiths actions seemed to indicate that he believed in his revelations as much as his most loyal followers smiths first recorded revelation was a rebuke from god for having let martin harris lose  pages of book of mormon manuscript chastising him for fearing man more than god the revelation was given in the voice of god rather than as a declaration mediated through smith and subsequent revelations assumed a similar authoritative style often opening with words such as hearken o ye people which profess my name saith the lord your god book of mormonedit main article book of mormon the book of mormon has been called the longest and most complex of smiths revelations it is organized as a compilation of smaller books each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader it tells the story of the rise and fall of a religious civilization beginning around  bc and ending in  ad the story begins with a family that leaves jerusalem just before the babylonian captivity they eventually construct a ship and sail to a promised land in the western hemisphere there they are divided into two factions nephites and lamanites the nephites become a righteous people who build a temple and live the law of moses though their prophets teach a christian gospel the book explains itself to be largely the work of mormon a nephite prophet and military figure the book closes when mormons son moroni finishes engraving and buries the records written on the golden plates christian themes permeate the work for instance nephite prophets in the book of mormon teach of christs coming and talk of the star that will appear at his birth after the crucifixion and resurrection in jerusalem jesus appears in the americas repeats the sermon on the mount blesses children and appoints twelve disciples the book ends with moronis exhortation to come unto christ early mormons understood the book of mormon to be a religious history of the indigenous peoples of the americas smiths followers view it as a companion to the bible and an additional witness of christ akin to a large apocryphal work modern historian fawn brodie has called the book of mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of smiths times saying that smith composed the book of mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him dan vogel another historian says that the work is autobiographical in nature according to some accounts smith dictated most of the book of mormon by looking into a seer stone placed in a stovepipe hat smith never said how he produced the book of mormon saying only that he translated by the power of god and implying that he had transcribed the words the book of mormon itself states only that its text will come forth by the gift and power of god unto the interpretation thereof as such considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists for at least some of the earliest dictation smith is said to have used the urim and thummim a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates later however he is said to have used a chocolatecolored stone he had found in  that he had used previously for treasure hunting joseph knight said that smith saw the words of the translation while he gazed at the stone or stones in the bottom of his hat excluding all light a process similar to divining the location of treasure sometimes smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table after completing the translation smith gave the brown stone to cowdery but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about  when he said he no longer needed it although the book of mormon drew many converts to the church fawn brodie argued in  that the book lives today because of the prophet not he because of the book smith had assumed a role as prophet seer and apostle of jesus christ and by early  he was introducing himself as joseph the prophet the language of authority in smiths revelations was appealing to converts and the revelations were given with the confidence of an old testament prophet moses and abrahamedit main articles book of abraham and book of moses smith said that in june  he received a revelation of moses in which moses saw the world and the ends thereof and asked god questions about the purpose of creation and mans relationship to god this revelation initiated a revision of the bible on which smith worked sporadically until  and which remained unpublished at his death smith said that he believed the bible had been corrupted through the ages and that his revision worked to restore the original intent it added long passages rewritten according to his inspiration while many changes involved straightening out seeming contradictions or making small clarifications other changes added large lost portions to the text for instance smiths revision nearly tripled the length of the first five chapters of genesis in what would become the book of moses the book of moses begins with moses inquiring of god as to the purpose of creation and is told in this account that god made the earth and heavens to bring humans to eternal life the book also provides an enlarged account of the genesis creation narrative and expands the story of enoch the ancestor of noah in the narrative enoch speaks with god receives a prophetic calling and eventually builds a city of zion so righteous that it was taken to heaven the book also elaborates and expands upon foreshadowing and types of christ in effect christianizing the old testament in  smith encouraged some latter day saints in kirtland to purchase rolls of ancient egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor over the next several years smith worked off and on as events allowed to produce a supposed translation of one of these rolls which he published in  as the book of abraham the book of abraham speaks of the founding of the abrahamic nation astronomy cosmology lineage and priesthood and gave another account of the creation story the papyri from which smith dictated the book of abraham were thought to have been lost in the great chicago fire but several fragments were rediscovered in the s were translated by egyptologists and were determined to be part of the book of the dead with no connection to abraham other revelationsedit see also book of commandments and doctrine and covenants the holy spirit may give you sudden strokes of ideas so

smith dictated revelations orally and they were recorded by a scribe without revisions or corrections revelations were immediately copied and then circulated among church members smiths revelations often came in response to specific questions he described the revelatory process as having pure intelligence flowing into him smith however never viewed the wording to be infallible the revelations were not gods words verbatim but couched in language suitable to josephs time in  smith edited and expanded many of the previous revelations publishing them as the book of commandments which later became part of the doctrine and covenants smith gave varying types of revelations some were temporal while others were spiritual or doctrinal some were received for a specific individual while others were directed at the whole church notable revelations include an  revelation called the law containing directions for missionary work rules for organizing society in zion a reiteration of the ten commandments an injunction to administer to the poor and needy and an outline for the law of consecration an  revelation called the vision added to the fundamentals of sin and atonement introduced doctrines of life after salvation the theme of exaltation and a heaven with degrees of glory another  revelation on priesthood was the first to explain priesthood doctrine three months later smith gave a lengthy revelation called the olive leaf containing themes of cosmology and eschatology and discussing subjects such as light truth intelligence and sanctification a related revelation given in  put christ at the center of salvation also in  at a time of temperance agitation smith delivered a revelation called the word of wisdom which counseled a diet of wholesome herbs fruits grains a sparing use of meat and recommended that latter day saints avoid strong alcoholic drinks tobacco and hot drinks later interpreted to mean tea and coffee the word of wisdom was not originally framed as a commandment but a recommendation as such smith and other latter day saints did not strictly follow this counsel though it later became a requirement in the lds church in  smith gave the great revelation that organized the priesthood into quorums and councils and served as a complex blueprint for church structure smiths last revelation on the new and everlasting covenant was recorded in  and dealt with the theology of family the doctrine of sealing and plural marriage before  most of smiths revelations dealt with establishing the church gathering his followers and building the city of zion while later revelations dealt with the priesthood endowment and exaltation the revelations slowed in kirtland during the autumn of  and again after the dedication of the kirtland temple as smith relied more heavily on his own teachings smith moved away from written revelations opening with verily thus saith the lord and taught more in sermons conversations and letters for instance the doctrines of baptism for the dead and the nature of god were introduced in sermons and one of smiths most famed statements about there being no such thing as immaterial matter was recorded from a casual conversation with a methodist preacher views and teachingsedit main article teachings of joseph smith smiths later theology described jesus and god the father as two distinct physical beings cosmology and theologyedit see also mormon cosmology and godhead latter day saints smith taught that all existence was material including a world of spirit matter so fine that it was invisible to all but the purest mortal eyes matter in smiths view could neither be created nor destroyed the creation involved only the reorganization of existing matter like matter smith saw intelligence as coeternal with god and taught that human spirits had been drawn from a preexistent pool of eternal intelligences nevertheless spirits could not experience a fullness of joy unless joined with corporeal bodies according to smith the work and glory of god then was to create worlds across the cosmos where inferior intelligences could be embodied though smith initially viewed god the father as a spirit he eventually began teaching that god was an advanced and glorified man embodied within time and space by the end of his life smith was teaching that both god the father and jesus were distinct beings with physical bodies but the holy spirit was a personage of spirit through the gradual acquisition of knowledge according to smith those who received exaltation could eventually become like god these teachings implied a vast hierarchy of gods with god himself having a father in smiths cosmology those who became gods would reign unified in purpose and will leading spirits of lesser capacity to share immortality and eternal life in smiths view the opportunity to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation apart from those who committed the eternal sin smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife religious authority and ritualedit see also priesthood latter day saints freemasonry and the latter day saint movement and endowment latter day saints smiths teachings were rooted in dispensational restorationism he taught that the church of christ restored through him was a latterday restoration of the early christian faith which had been lost in the great apostasy at first smiths church had little sense of hierarchy his religious authority was derived from visions and revelations though smith did not claim exclusive prophethood an early revelation designated him as the only prophet allowed to issue commandments as moses this religious authority encompassed economic and political as well as spiritual matters for instance in the early s he temporarily instituted a form of religious communism called the united order that required latter day saints to give all their property to the church which was divided among the faithful he also envisioned that the theocratic institutions he established would have a role in the worldwide political organization of the millennium by the mids smith began teaching a hierarchy of three priesthoods—the melchizedek the aaronic and the patriarchal each priesthood was a continuation of biblical priesthoods through patrilineal succession or ordination by biblical figures appearing in visions upon introducing the melchizedek or high priesthood in  smith taught that its recipients would be endowed with power from on high thus fulfilling a need for a greater holiness and an authority commensurate with the new testament apostles this doctrine of endowment evolved through the s until in  the nauvoo endowment included an elaborate ceremony containing elements similar to freemasonry and the jewish tradition of kabbalah the endowment was extended to women in  though smith never clarified whether women could be ordained to priesthood offices smith taught that the high priesthoods endowment of heavenly power included the sealing powers of elijah allowing high priests to effect binding consequences in the afterlife for example this power would enable proxy baptisms for the dead and priesthood marriages that would be effective into the afterlife elijahs sealing powers also enabled the second anointing or fulness sic of the priesthood which according to smith sealed married couples to their exaltation theology of familyedit during the early s smith unfolded a theology of family relations called the new and everlasting covenant that superseded all earthly bonds he taught that outside the covenant marriages were simply matters of contract and that in the afterlife individuals married outside the covenant or not married would be limited in their progression to fully enter the covenant a man and woman must participate in a first anointing a sealing ceremony and a second anointing also called sealing by the holy spirit of promise when fully sealed into the covenant smith said that no sin nor blasphemy other than the eternal sin could keep them from their exaltation in the afterlife according to smith only one person on earth at a time—in this case smith—could possess this power of sealing a painting of smith by bathsheba w smith created circa  smith taught that the highest level of exaltation could be achieved through plural marriage polygamy which was the ultimate manifestation of this new and everlasting covenant plural marriage according to smith allowed an individual to transcend the angelic state and become a god accelerating the expansion of ones heavenly kingdom polygamyedit see also origin of latter day saint polygamy and mormonism

but insisted it was not adulterous presumably because he had taken alger as a plural wife in april  smith wed louisa beaman during the next twoandahalf years he married or was sealed to about  additional women ten of whom were already married to other men some of these polyandrous marriages were done with the consent of the first husbands and some plural marriages may have been considered eternityonly sealings ten of smiths plural wives were between the ages of fourteen and twenty others were over fifty the practice of polygamy was kept secret from both nonmormons and most members of the church during smiths lifetime polygamy caused a breach between smith and his first wife emma although emma knew of some of her husbands marriages she almost certainly did not know the extent of his polygamous activities in  emma temporarily accepted smiths marriage to four women boarded in the smith household but soon regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave in july  smith

message while campaigning for president of the united states in  smith had opportunity to take political positions on issues of the day smith considered the us constitution and especially the bill of rights to be inspired by god and the latter day saints best and perhaps only defense he believed a strong central government was crucial to the nations wellbeing and thought democracy better than tyranny—although he also taught that a theocratic monarchy was the ideal form of government in foreign affairs smith was an expansionist though he viewed expansionism as brotherhood smith favored a strong central bank and high tariffs to protect american business and agriculture he disfavored imprisonment of convicts except for murder preferring efforts to reform criminals through labor he also opposed courtsmartial for military deserters he supported capital punishment but opposed hanging preferring execution by firing squad or beheading on the issue of slavery smith took different positions initially he opposed it but during the mids when the mormons were settling in missouri a slave state smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly antiabolitionist essay then in the early s after mormons had been expelled from missouri he once again opposed slavery during his presidential campaign of  he proposed ending slavery by  and compensating slaveholders for their loss smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites and he welcomed slaves into the church however he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters and he opposed interracial marriage smith declared that he would be one of the instruments in fulfilling nebuchadnezzars statue vision in the book of daniel that secular government would be destroyed without sword or gun and would be replaced with a theodemocratic kingdom of god smith taught that this kingdom would be governed by theocratic principles but that it would also be multidenominational and democratic so long as the people chose wisely ethics and behavioredit a succinct statement of ethics by smith is found in his th article of faith we believe in being honest true chaste benevolent virtuous and in doing good to all men indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of paul—we believe all things we hope all things we have endured many things and hope to be able to endure all things if there is anything virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy we seek after these things smith said his ethical rule was when the lord commands do it he also taught that which is wrong under one circumstance may be and often is right under another god said thou shalt not kill—at another time he said thou shalt utterly destroy this is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted—by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the elders of the kingdom are placed whatever god requires is right  even things which may be considered abominable to all those who do not understand the order of heaven beginning in the mids and into the s as the mormon people became involved in conflicts with the missouri and illinois state governments smith taught that congress has no power to make a law that would abridge the rights of my religion and that they were not under the obligation to follow laws they deemed as being contrary to their religious privilege smith may have thus felt justified in

beliefs were revealed through his revelations vogel  p viii arguing that smith believed he was called of god but occasionally engaged in fraudulent activities in order to preach gods word more effectively  bushman  p  the revelation gave the first inkling of how joseph would speak in his prophetic voice the speaker stands above and outside joseph sharply separated emotionally and intellectually vogel  pp – brodie  pp – although he may not have sensed their significance these josephs first revelations marked a turningpoint in his life for they changed the book of mormon from

was uttered slowly and very distinctly and with a pause between each sufficiently long for it to be recorded by an ordinary writer in long hand this was the manner in which all his revelations were dictated and written there was never any hesitation reviewing or reading back in order to keep the run of the subject neither did any of these communications undergo revisions interlinings or

palmyra area although smiths parents disagreed about religion the family was caught up in this excitement smith later said he became interested in religion at about the age of twelve he participated in church classes and read the bible as a teenager he may have been sympathetic to methodism with other family members smith also engaged in religious folk magic not an uncommon practice at the time both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from god smith said that although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations years later smith said that in  he had received a vision that resolved his religious confusion while praying in a wooded area near his home he said that god in a vision had told him his sins were forgiven and that all contemporary churches had turned aside from the gospel smith said he told the experience to a preacher who dismissed the story with contempt but the experience was largely unknown even to most mormons until the s although smith may have understood the event as a personal conversion this first vision later grew in importance among mormons who today see it as the first event in the restoration of the gospel smith said he received golden plates from the angel moroni at the hill cumorah smith said that in  while praying one night for forgiveness from his sins he was visited by an angel named moroni who revealed the location of a buried book made of golden plates as well as other artifacts including a breastplate and a set of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame which had been hidden in a hill in manchester near his home smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning but was unsuccessful because the angel prevented him smith reported that during the next four years he made annual visits to the hill but each time returned without the plates meanwhile the smith family faced financial hardship due in part to the november  death of smiths oldest brother alvin who had assumed a leadership role in the family family members supplemented their meager farm income by hiring out for odd jobs and working as treasure seekers a type of magical supernaturalism common during the period smith was said to have an ability to locate lost items by looking into a seer stone which he also used in treasure hunting including several unsuccessful attempts to find buried treasure sponsored by a wealthy farmer in chenango county new york in  smith was brought before a chenango county court for glasslooking or pretending to find lost treasure the result of the proceeding remains unclear as primary sources report various conflicting outcomes while

supporting his daughter other than money digging of which he disapproved smith and emma eloped and married on january   after which the couple began boarding with smiths parents in manchester later that year when smith promised to abandon treasure seeking hale offered to let the couple live on his property in harmony and help smith get started in business smith said that he made his last annual visit to the hill on september   taking emma with him this time he said he retrieved the plates and put them in a locked chest he said the angel commanded him not to show the plates to anyone else but to publish their translation reputed to be the religious record of indigenous americans smith said that the plates were engraved in an unknown language reformed egyptian and he told associates that he was capable of reading and translating them although smith had left his treasure hunting company his former associates believed he had doublecrossed them by taking for himself what they considered

transcribed some characters that he said were engraved on the plates and then dictated a translation to his wife in february  martin harris arrived to assist smith by transcribing his dictation harris also took a sample of the characters to a few prominent scholars including charles anthon who harris said initially authenticated the characters and their translation but then retracted his opinion after learning that smith was supposed to have received the plates from an angel anthon denied harriss account of the meeting claiming instead that he had tried to convince harris that he had been the victim of a fraud nevertheless harris returned to harmony in april  encouraged to continue as smiths scribe smith continued to dictate to harris until midjune  when harris began having doubts about the project fueled in part by his wifes skepticism harris convinced smith to let him take the existing  pages of manuscript to palmyra to show a few family members including his wife harris lost the manuscript—of which there was no other copy—at about the same time smiths wife emma gave birth to a son alvin who died the same day smith said that as punishment for losing the manuscript the angel

necromancer on the methodist class roll cover page of the book of mormon original  edition smith said that the angel returned the plates to him on september   and he resumed dictation in april  after

three witnesses—along with a later group of eight witnesses composed of male members of the whitmer and smith families—signed statements testifying that they had seen the golden plates statements were issued by both the three witnesses and the eight witnesses the primary distinction between the two groups were that the three witnesses stated that an angel showed them the plates and the voice of god confirmed their truth while the eight witnesses where shown the plates by smith according to smith the angel moroni took back the plates once smith finished using them the completed work the book of mormon was published in palmyra on march   by printer e b grandin martin harris having mortgaged his farm to finance it soon after on april   smith and his followers formally organized the church of

to trial as a disorderly person he was acquitted but both he and cowdery had to flee colesville to escape a gathering mob in probable reference to this period of flight smith said that peter james and john had appeared to him and had ordained him and cowdery to a higher priesthood smiths authority was undermined when oliver cowdery hiram page and other church members also claimed to receive revelations in response smith dictated a revelation which clarified his office as a prophet and an apostle and which declared that only he held the keys of the mysteries and the revelations with the ability to inscribe scripture for the church shortly after the conference smith dispatched cowdery peter whitmer and others on a mission to proselytize native americans cowdery was also assigned the

activities he clearly approved of those of which he did know after rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had no place in the mormon community the danites forcibly expelled them from the

compilation of the  most significant americans of all time smithsonian magazine ranked smith first in the category of religious figures mormons and exmormons have produced a large amount of scholarly work about smith and to a large extent the result has been two discordant pictures of very different people a man of god on the one hand and on the other a fraud preying on the ignorance of his followers believers tended to focus on his achievements and religious teachings deemphasizing his personal defects while detractors focused on his mistakes legal troubles and controversial doctrines during the first half of the th century some writers suggested that smith might have suffered from epileptic seizures or from psychological disorders such as paranoid delusions or manicdepressive illness that might explain his visions and revelations many modern biographers disagree with these ideas more nuanced interpretations range from viewing smith as a prophet who had normal human weaknesses a pious fraud who believed he was called of god to preach repentance and felt justified inventing visions in order to convert people or a gifted mythmaker who was the product of his yankee environment biographers mormon and nonmormon agree that smith was one of the most influential charismatic and innovative figures in american religious history buildings named in honor of smith the

others according to richard bushman the signal feature of smiths life was his sense of being guided by revelation instead of presenting ideas with logical arguments smith dictated authoritative revelations and let people decide whether to believe smiths teachings came primarily through his revelations which read like scripture oracular and open to interpretation smith and his followers viewed his revelations as being above teachings or opinions and smiths actions seemed to indicate that he believed in his revelations as much as his most loyal followers smiths first recorded revelation was a rebuke from god for having let martin harris lose  pages of book of mormon manuscript chastising him for fearing man more than god the revelation was given in the voice of god rather than as a declaration mediated through smith and subsequent revelations assumed a similar authoritative style often opening with words such as hearken o ye people which profess my name saith the lord your god book of mormonedit main article book of mormon the book of mormon has been called the longest and most complex of smiths revelations it is organized as a compilation of smaller books each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader it tells the story of the rise and fall of a religious civilization beginning around  bc and ending in  ad the story begins with a family that leaves jerusalem just before the babylonian captivity they eventually construct a ship and sail to a promised land in the western hemisphere there they are divided into two factions nephites and lamanites the nephites become a righteous people who build a temple and live the law of moses though their prophets teach a christian gospel the book explains itself to be largely the work of mormon a nephite prophet and military figure the book closes when mormons son moroni finishes engraving and buries the records written on the golden plates christian themes permeate the work for instance nephite prophets in the book of mormon teach of christs coming and talk of the star that will appear at his birth after the crucifixion and resurrection in jerusalem jesus appears in the americas repeats the sermon on the mount blesses children and appoints twelve disciples the book ends with moronis exhortation to come unto christ early mormons understood the book of mormon to be a religious history of the indigenous peoples of the americas smiths followers view it as a companion to the bible and an additional witness of christ akin to a large apocryphal work modern historian fawn brodie has called the book of mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of smiths times saying that smith composed the book of mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him dan vogel another historian says that the work is autobiographical in nature according to some accounts smith dictated most of the book of mormon by looking into a seer stone placed in a stovepipe hat smith never said how he produced the book of mormon saying only that he translated by the power of god and implying that he had transcribed the words the book of mormon itself states only that its text will come forth by the gift and power of god unto the interpretation thereof as such considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists for at least some of the earliest dictation smith is said to have used the urim and thummim a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates later however he is said to have used a chocolatecolored stone he had found in  that he had used previously for treasure hunting joseph knight said that smith saw the words of the translation while he gazed at the stone or stones in the bottom of his hat excluding all light a process similar to divining the location of treasure sometimes smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table after completing the translation smith gave the brown stone to cowdery but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about  when he said he no longer needed it although the book of mormon drew many converts to the church fawn brodie argued in  that the book lives today because of the prophet not he because of the book smith had assumed a role as prophet seer and apostle of jesus christ and by early  he was introducing himself as joseph the prophet the language of authority in smiths revelations was appealing to converts and the revelations were given with the confidence of an old testament prophet moses and abrahamedit main articles book of abraham and book of moses smith said that in june  he received a revelation of moses in which moses saw the world and the ends thereof and asked god questions about the purpose of creation and mans relationship to god this revelation initiated a revision of the bible on which smith worked sporadically until  and which remained unpublished at his death smith said that he believed the bible had been corrupted through the ages and that his revision worked to restore the original intent it added long passages rewritten according to his inspiration while many changes involved straightening out seeming contradictions or making small clarifications other changes added large lost portions to the text for instance smiths revision nearly tripled the length of the first five chapters of genesis in what would become the book of moses the book of moses begins with moses inquiring of god as to the purpose of creation and is told in this account that god made the earth and heavens to bring humans to eternal life the book also provides an enlarged account of the genesis creation narrative and expands the story of enoch the ancestor of noah in the narrative enoch speaks with god receives a prophetic calling and eventually builds a city of zion so righteous that it was taken to heaven the book also elaborates and expands upon foreshadowing and types of christ in effect christianizing the old testament in  smith encouraged some latter day saints in kirtland to purchase rolls of ancient egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor over the next several years smith worked off and on as events allowed to produce a supposed translation of one of these rolls which he published in  as the book of abraham the book of abraham speaks of the founding of the abrahamic nation astronomy cosmology lineage and priesthood and gave another account of the creation story the papyri from which smith dictated the book of abraham were thought to have been lost in the great chicago fire but several fragments were rediscovered in the s were translated by egyptologists and were determined to be part of the book of the dead with no connection to abraham other revelationsedit see also book of commandments and doctrine and covenants the holy spirit may give you sudden strokes of ideas so

smith dictated revelations orally and they were recorded by a scribe without revisions or corrections revelations were immediately copied and then circulated among church members smiths revelations often came in response to specific questions he described the revelatory process as having pure intelligence flowing into him smith however never viewed the wording to be infallible the revelations were not gods words verbatim but couched in language suitable to josephs time in  smith edited and expanded many of the previous revelations publishing them as the book of commandments which later became part of the doctrine and covenants smith gave varying types of revelations some were temporal while others were spiritual or doctrinal some were received for a specific individual while others were directed at the whole church notable revelations include an  revelation called the law containing directions for missionary work rules for organizing society in zion a reiteration of the ten commandments an injunction to administer to the poor and needy and an outline for the law of consecration an  revelation called the vision added to the fundamentals of sin and atonement introduced doctrines of life after salvation the theme of exaltation and a heaven with degrees of glory another  revelation on priesthood was the first to explain priesthood doctrine three months later smith gave a lengthy revelation called the olive leaf containing themes of cosmology and eschatology and discussing subjects such as light truth intelligence and sanctification a related revelation given in  put christ at the center of salvation also in  at a time of temperance agitation smith delivered a revelation called the word of wisdom which counseled a diet of wholesome herbs fruits grains a sparing use of meat and recommended that latter day saints avoid strong alcoholic drinks tobacco and hot drinks later interpreted to mean tea and coffee the word of wisdom was not originally framed as a commandment but a recommendation as such smith and other latter day saints did not strictly follow this counsel though it later became a requirement in the lds church in  smith gave the great revelation that organized the priesthood into quorums and councils and served as a complex blueprint for church structure smiths last revelation on the new and everlasting covenant was recorded in  and dealt with the theology of family the doctrine of sealing and plural marriage before  most of smiths revelations dealt with establishing the church gathering his followers and building the city of zion while later revelations dealt with the priesthood endowment and exaltation the revelations slowed in kirtland during the autumn of  and again after the dedication of the kirtland temple as smith relied more heavily on his own teachings smith moved away from written revelations opening with verily thus saith the lord and taught more in sermons conversations and letters for instance the doctrines of baptism for the dead and the nature of god were introduced in sermons and one of smiths most famed statements about there being no such thing as immaterial matter was recorded from a casual conversation with a methodist preacher views and teachingsedit main article teachings of joseph smith smiths later theology described jesus and god the father as two distinct physical beings cosmology and theologyedit see also mormon cosmology and godhead latter day saints smith taught that all existence was material including a world of spirit matter so fine that it was invisible to all but the purest mortal eyes matter in smiths view could neither be created nor destroyed the creation involved only the reorganization of existing matter like matter smith saw intelligence as coeternal with god and taught that human spirits had been drawn from a preexistent pool of eternal intelligences nevertheless spirits could not experience a fullness of joy unless joined with corporeal bodies according to smith the work and glory of god then was to create worlds across the cosmos where inferior intelligences could be embodied though smith initially viewed god the father as a spirit he eventually began teaching that god was an advanced and glorified man embodied within time and space by the end of his life smith was teaching that both god the father and jesus were distinct beings with physical bodies but the holy spirit was a personage of spirit through the gradual acquisition of knowledge according to smith those who received exaltation could eventually become like god these teachings implied a vast hierarchy of gods with god himself having a father in smiths cosmology those who became gods would reign unified in purpose and will leading spirits of lesser capacity to share immortality and eternal life in smiths view the opportunity to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation apart from those who committed the eternal sin smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife religious authority and ritualedit see also priesthood latter day saints freemasonry and the latter day saint movement and endowment latter day saints smiths teachings were rooted in dispensational restorationism he taught that the church of christ restored through him was a latterday restoration of the early christian faith which had been lost in the great apostasy at first smiths church had little sense of hierarchy his religious authority was derived from visions and revelations though smith did not claim exclusive prophethood an early revelation designated him as the only prophet allowed to issue commandments as moses this religious authority encompassed economic and political as well as spiritual matters for instance in the early s he temporarily instituted a form of religious communism called the united order that required latter day saints to give all their property to the church which was divided among the faithful he also envisioned that the theocratic institutions he established would have a role in the worldwide political organization of the millennium by the mids smith began teaching a hierarchy of three priesthoods—the melchizedek the aaronic and the patriarchal each priesthood was a continuation of biblical priesthoods through patrilineal succession or ordination by biblical figures appearing in visions upon introducing the melchizedek or high priesthood in  smith taught that its recipients would be endowed with power from on high thus fulfilling a need for a greater holiness and an authority commensurate with the new testament apostles this doctrine of endowment evolved through the s until in  the nauvoo endowment included an elaborate ceremony containing elements similar to freemasonry and the jewish tradition of kabbalah the endowment was extended to women in  though smith never clarified whether women could be ordained to priesthood offices smith taught that the high priesthoods endowment of heavenly power included the sealing powers of elijah allowing high priests to effect binding consequences in the afterlife for example this power would enable proxy baptisms for the dead and priesthood marriages that would be effective into the afterlife elijahs sealing powers also enabled the second anointing or fulness sic of the priesthood which according to smith sealed married couples to their exaltation theology of familyedit during the early s smith unfolded a theology of family relations called the new and everlasting covenant that superseded all earthly bonds he taught that outside the covenant marriages were simply matters of contract and that in the afterlife individuals married outside the covenant or not married would be limited in their progression to fully enter the covenant a man and woman must participate in a first anointing a sealing ceremony and a second anointing also called sealing by the holy spirit of promise when fully sealed into the covenant smith said that no sin nor blasphemy other than the eternal sin could keep them from their exaltation in the afterlife according to smith only one person on earth at a time—in this case smith—could possess this power of sealing a painting of smith by bathsheba w smith created circa  smith taught that the highest level of exaltation could be achieved through plural marriage polygamy which was the ultimate manifestation of this new and everlasting covenant plural marriage according to smith allowed an individual to transcend the angelic state and become a god accelerating the expansion of ones heavenly kingdom polygamyedit see also origin of latter day saint polygamy and mormonism and polygamy smith had by some accounts been teaching a polygamy doctrine as early as  and there is unconfirmed evidence that smith was a polygamist by  although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy in  there was a rift between smith and oliver cowdery over the issue cowdery suspected smith had engaged in a relationship with his serving girl fanny alger smith never denied a relationship but insisted it was not adulterous presumably because he had taken alger as a plural wife in april  smith wed louisa beaman during the next twoandahalf years he married or was sealed to about  additional women ten of whom were already married to other men some of these polyandrous marriages were done with the consent of the first husbands and some plural marriages may have been considered eternityonly sealings ten of smiths plural wives were between the ages of fourteen and twenty others were over fifty the practice of polygamy was kept secret from both nonmormons and most members of the church during smiths lifetime polygamy caused a breach between smith and his first wife emma although emma knew of some of her husbands marriages she almost certainly did not know the extent of his polygamous activities in  emma temporarily accepted smiths marriage to four women boarded in the smith household but soon regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave in july  smith dictated a revelation directing emma to accept plural marriage but the two were not reconciled until september  after emma began participating in temple ceremonies political viewsedit the neutrality

message while campaigning for president of the united states in  smith had opportunity to take political positions on issues of the day smith considered the us constitution and especially the bill of rights to be inspired by god and the latter day saints best and perhaps only defense he believed a strong central government was crucial to the nations wellbeing and thought democracy better than tyranny—although he also taught that a theocratic monarchy was the ideal form of government in foreign affairs smith was an expansionist though he viewed expansionism as brotherhood smith favored a strong central bank and high tariffs to protect american business and agriculture he disfavored imprisonment of convicts except for murder preferring efforts to reform criminals through labor he also opposed courtsmartial for military deserters he supported capital punishment but opposed hanging preferring execution by firing squad or beheading on the issue of slavery smith took different positions initially he opposed it but during the mids when the mormons were settling in missouri a slave state smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly antiabolitionist essay then in the early s after mormons had been expelled from missouri he once again opposed slavery during his presidential campaign of  he proposed ending slavery by  and compensating slaveholders for their loss smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites and he welcomed slaves into the church however he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters and he opposed interracial marriage smith declared that he would be one of the instruments in fulfilling nebuchadnezzars statue vision in the book of daniel that secular government would be destroyed without sword or gun and would be replaced with a theodemocratic kingdom of god smith taught that this kingdom would be governed by theocratic principles but that it would also be multidenominational and democratic so long as the people chose wisely ethics and behavioredit a succinct statement of ethics by smith is found in his th article of faith we believe in being honest true chaste benevolent virtuous and in doing good to all men indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of paul—we believe all things we hope all things we have endured many things and hope to be able to endure all things if there is anything virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy we seek after these things smith said his ethical rule was when the lord commands do it he also taught that which is wrong under one circumstance may be and often is right under another god said thou shalt not kill—at another time he said thou shalt utterly destroy this is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted—by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the elders of the kingdom are placed whatever god requires is right  even things which may be considered abominable to all those who do not understand the order of heaven beginning in the mids and into the s as the mormon people became involved in conflicts with the missouri and illinois state governments smith taught that congress has no power to make a law that would abridge the rights of my religion and that they were not under the obligation to follow laws they deemed as being contrary to their religious privilege smith may have thus felt justified in
