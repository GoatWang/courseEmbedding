flat full year revenue with lower volumes offset by revenue per hl growth driven by revenue management initiatives and favorable brand mix our market share trend is improving in the us thanks to strong performance from michelob ultra and our portfolio of highend brands as well as improvement in our value brands our positioning of michelob ultra as a lifestyle brand led to doubledigit growth and seven consecutive quarters of share gains we’re also gaining share with highend brands stella artois and goose island strong advertising campaigns and activations like the made in america festival are helping stabilize budweiser in the us we have work to do on our largest us brand bud light and have transitioned to a new platform famous among friends grounded in bud lights role cementing

readytodrink line and our flavored malt beverage offerings including the spikedseltzer brand which is new to the portfolio  we will also continue to invest in our craft brands to develop these future growth engines latin america north we had a very difficult year in brazil in  our beer volumes were down  for the year driven by continued pressure on consumer disposable income net revenue declined by  with net revenue per hl up  as part of our revenue management strategy we are using our complete portfolio of packs and brands to achieve attractive more competitive consumer price points this includes growing our mix of returnable glass bottles rgbs a format that now accounts for  of our volume in the supermarket channel while rgbs have a negative impact on net revenue per hl they can help boost ebitda and margin over time although  has been a very challenging year in brazil we remain optimistic about the future for our business we expect that favorable demographics the closing of

global brands performed well throughout the region corona helped develop the premium segment with its expanded coverage and disruptive consumer experiences via its sunsets platform in corona’s home country of mexico preference and volume gains for both corona extra and corona light provided a boost to the brand which now represents nearly half of our domestic beer sales we launched the noalcohol corona cero in mexico with a “same taste no alcohol” campaign and expect it to help create new consumption occasions and increase consumption frequency in the country strengthened by consistent positioning efforts premium brands club colombia in colombia and cusqueña in peru delivered doubledigit topline growth we also continued to develop innovative new options including bud light mangorita victoria chelada victoria oro modelo trigo club colombia trigo cusqueña quinua redd’s apple and pony malta plus asia pacific a tough macro environment and extreme weather put pressure on the industry
