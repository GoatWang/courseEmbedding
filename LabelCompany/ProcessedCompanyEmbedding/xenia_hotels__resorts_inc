are far from home andor associates of the person bestowing guestfriendship the idea originated as the greeks believed that gods mingled among humans and would often travel in disguise thus to avoid angering a possible god in disguise they thought it wise to treat all guests with the courtesy and respect that you would bestow on a heavenly being later the practice of offering hospitality to “humble strangers” or xenos became a common custom among the greeks about us portfolio overview xenia investor relations contact us xenia hotels  resorts copyright  terms of use xenia hotels  resorts

simon zhen jun    be first to comment if youre like me you probably make it a habit of booking trips through online travel sites theyre great tools for finding deals on flight hotels and more some even offer their own credit cards to help you save more money on travel  a great way to get rewarded for your loyalty i took a look at the four major online travel sites that offer credit cards  priceline travelocity expedia and orbitz  and compared their cards to determine the best online travel site card heres what i looked at when reviewing the priceline rewards™ visa® card travelocity® rewards american express® card expedia® voyager and orbitz rewards visa® cards travel site cards  rewards rates card bonus rewards base rewards priceline rewards visa  points per dollar on pricelinecom purchases  point per dollar on all other purchases travelocity rewards american express  points per dollar on eligible travelocity purchases  point per dollar on all other purchases expedia voyager  expedia points per dollar on eligible expedia purchases and  expedia points per dollar on dining  entertainment  expedia point per dollar on all other purchases orbitz rewards visa  orbucks back on eligible hotels booked via mobile app  through desktopweb and  orbucks back on flight booked via mobile app  through desktopweb  orbucks on all other purchases you want to earn points fast so you can get those free flights and hotel stays so it makes sense to first look at how quickly these online travel site credit cards can make that happen orbitz rewards visa ®takes first place based on the numbers alone you can see that the orbitz rewards visa® card stands out with its amazing rewards rates on travel purchases made through the orbitz website the caveat to orbitz is that youll have to deal with their rather confusing orbucks program but once you have that figured out great rewards follow for example you can get  back on eligible hotels booked through the orbitz mobile app you can also use the mobile app to get  back on flights if youre not an app person you can still get good rewards on desktop but its important to know that they differ either way orbitz rewards are highly competitive with travel credit cards priceline and travelocity take second place but priceline rewards™ visa® card and travelocity® rewards american express® card have simple rewards programs you get bonus points on travel purchases made through their sites and a flat  point per dollar for everything else such a simple program stresses one thing you’ll get value from these cards only if you use them for travel purchases otherwise any other rewards card would be better priceline rewards™ visa® card gives more points per dollar on bonus travel but travelocity® rewards american express® card picks up the slack with a stellar redemption option expedia® voyager takes third place the expedia® voyager card has a rewards program that aims to convince cardholders to always keep the card in their wallets you’ll get bonus points for booking travel through expedia — which is usually done online but to get bonus points for restaurants and entertainment you’ll have to carry the expedia® voyager card in your wallet to encourage more spending the card gives you  bonus expedia points this happens when you spend  in the prior year a  point bonus on  spent after our review of the expedia® voyager card we realized that while the rewards rate is decent and the bonus is nice thats not enough to differentiate expedia from the pack winner rewards rate orbitz rewards visa® credit card travel site cards  redemption card priceline rewards visa travelocity rewards american express expedia voyager orbitz rewards visa bonus rewards  points per dollar on pricelinecom purchases

for the cost of an airline ticket or flight  hotel package up to maximum credit of  varies based on travel reward  orbuck per  the orbitz rewards visa® credit card may help you rack up points the fastest but the value of those points may not be as great as they initially seem with the accumulated orbucks you can only redeem for bookings at qualifying hotels through orbitz that can be restrictive when youre missing the other major aspect of travel flights the expedia® voyager card also forces you to use your points toward travel booked through expedia but at least you can use the points for flights and hotels these redemptions are not as limiting they are great if you happen to always find the best prices on expedia meanwhile the two remaining cards only offer statement credits which mean your balance is being erased by however much you earn back i feel statement credits are the best reward options  think of it as receiving a refund on a past purchase  very convenient the travelocity® rewards american express® card has one noteworthy highlight it lets you redeem a statement credit for up to  on flights or eligible hotels and vacation packages with no blackout dates booked through travelocity for just  points  cents of value per  point that’s an incentive for you to save up those points instead of redeeming at the lower denominations the priceline rewards™ visa® card however is very attractive because of its extremely flexible redemption options you can pretty much “erase” any purchase with your accumulated points reminds me of the popular barclaycard arrival plus™ world elite mastercard® the optimal redemption on the travelocity® rewards american express® card is the  statement credit for  points which can be earned with  in travelocity purchases  points meanwhile to redeem  on the priceline rewards™ visa® card you’ll need  points which can be earned with  in priceline purchases  points so you’ll get slightly better redemption values with the travelocity® rewards american express® card but you’ll have more flexible redemption options with the priceline rewards™ visa® card there’s no proper way to evaluate the two advantages so i’m calling it a tie between the two winner redemptions tie priceline rewards™ visa® card and travelocity® rewards american express® card annual fee priceline rewards™ visa® card  travelocity® rewards american express® card  expedia® voyager  orbitz rewards visa® credit card  travel credit cards are notorious for having annual fees  often because they have various travel perks that justify such fees eg free checked bags complimentary lounge passes and companion tickets none of the online travel agency credit cards have any ties to specific airlines or hotel chains so they don’t really have any of these standout travel benefits that would warrant an annual fee of the four cards only expedia® voyager has an annual fee at  per year it’s a quite a lot for anyone who doesnt like annual fees but the card has a set of great travel benefits  particularly its  statement  to make up for that fee however when strictly speaking about the cost of the annual fee it’s a threeway tie between the priceline rewards™ visa® card travelocity® rewards american express® card and orbitz rewards visa® credit cards winner annual fee tie priceline rewards™ visa® card travelocity® rewards american express® card and orbitz rewards visa® credit card interest rates priceline rewards™ visa® card  apr travelocity® rewards american express® card  apr expedia® voyager  apr orbitz rewards visa® credit card  apr it’s never a good idea to pay interest on a credit card especially a rewards credit card also rewards credit cards tend to have higher interest rates which is the case for all four online travel agency credit cards their aprs are relatively similar but the one with lowest average apr is expedia® voyager meanwhile the orbitz rewards visa® credit card has the highest average apr  probably because it has such high rewards rates even though expedia® voyager takes the cake for interest rates again i don’t ever suggest that you pay interest on any rewards credit card the value of your rewards will be wiped out by those interest charges winner interest rate expedia® voyager card coverages did your flight get delayed for a long time you might be compensated for lodging food and more as you wait for the next flight this is just one example of how card coverages can be useful every credit card comes with its own suite of card coverages that you should take into account below is a table that lists out the protection and coverages offered by each card a barclaycard spokesperson did not reply to me with a full guide of benefits for the priceline rewards visa and travelocity rewards amex cards the information below is based on standard visa benefits for priceline and on the latest travelocity rewards amex benefits guide i could find online priceline travelocity expedia orbitz card benefits card priceline rewards visa travelocity rewards american express expedia voyager orbitz rewards visa  liability fraud protection yes yes yes yes purchase

yes visa signature only no yes yes visa signature only baggage delay insurance no no yes no lost luggage reimbursement yes visa signature only no yes yes visa signature only with the exception of the travelocity® rewards american express® card all of the online travel agency cards provide a decent set of card coverages that encompass regular retail purchases to travel you’ll notice that for the priceline rewards™ visa® card and orbitz rewards visa® credit card i highlight certain coverages that are available only to visa signature cards visa signature is the upper tier version of visa platinum  they offer different benefits priceline and orbitz will give out different versions depending on your credit essentially you want the visa signature version because of its extended list of coverages again looking at the chart i’d say that the visa signature versions of the priceline rewards™ visa® card and orbitz rewards visa® credit card offer the best card coverages in the group expedia® voyager was almost able to keep up with these two cards but it fell out of the contest because it doesn’t offer travel services and assistance i spoke with a citi customer service rep to confirm this winner card coverages tie priceline rewards™ visa® card andorbitz rewards visa® credit card travel site cards  travel benefits card travel benefits priceline rewards visa no preset spending limit and personal concierge travel upgrades and discounts at select visa partners visa signature travelocity rewards american express none expedia voyager  annual statement credit for airline incidentals on qualified airlines or wifi carries or for the global entry fee no foreign transaction fees and free personal concierge orbitz rewards visa no preset spending limit and personal concierge travel upgrades and discounts at select visa partners visa signature plus no foreign transaction fees we’re talking about online travel agency credit cards here so we have to look at the travel perks that these cards offer if any right off the bat travelocity® rewards american express® card is looking bad due to a lack of any noteworthy travel benefits so lets focus on the other cards given that priceline rewards™ visa® card and orbitz rewards visa® credit card are capable of being visa signature cards you can receive free nights and discounts through visa’s hotel and car rental partners however the orbitz rewards visa® credit card stands taller with the waived foreign transaction fees which means you’re not going to pay currency exchange fees when swiping your card abroad however the card with the best travel perk is definitely expedia® voyager the  statement credit can be used for a basket of things including checked bags inflight meals wifi access lounge passes on  major airlines airtran airways alaska airlines american airlines delta airlines frontier airlines jetblue airways southwest airlines unitedcontinental airlines us airways and virgin america airlines and the  global entry application fee the global entry program allows preapproved travelers to receive expedited clearance upon entry into the us expedia® voyager card has a  annual fee because of the  statement credit if you can maximize this  statement credit you’ll more than recoup the annual fee top this perk off with the rest of the card’s travel benefits and you’ve got a solid travel companion winner travel benefits expedia® voyager verdict priceline rewards™ visa® card oddly the priceline rewards™ visa® card and orbitz rewards visa® credit card actually tied with three winning categories each so why did i give the crown to thepriceline rewards™ visa® card firstly the hotelonly redemption option on the orbitz card stood out as a major restriction to how you can spend your points and it carries the highest average apr of the group these two aspects led me to favor the priceline rewards™ visa® card winners and losers you decide ultimately you know whats best for your needs and preferences this rundown is meant to give you as much information as possible but you know yourself better than anyone else your credit cards should help you enjoy and get the most out of your experience but they are not the experience choose your destination choose your credit card and be present in the moment did you enjoy this article yes no oops what was wrong please let us know

is the ancient greek concept of hospitality the generosity and courtesy shown to those who are far from home andor associates of the person bestowing guestfriendship the idea originated as the greeks believed that gods mingled among humans and would often travel in disguise thus to avoid angering a possible god in disguise they thought it wise to treat all guests with the courtesy and respect that you would bestow on a heavenly being later the practice of offering hospitality to “humble strangers” or xenos became a common custom among the greeks about us portfolio overview xenia investor
