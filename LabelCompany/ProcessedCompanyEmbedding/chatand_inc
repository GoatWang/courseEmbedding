for technology development and up to  for investor relations the balance of the proceeds we expect to use for general working capital we may utilize a portion of the proceeds for synergistic acquisitions and strategic mergers although we have no current plans and have not entered into any discussions in that regard we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling

then we will receive gross proceeds of approximately  no assurances can be given however that all or any portion of such warrants will ever be exercised the markets for online engagement technology and online customer services are intensely competitive and characterized by aggressive marketing evolving industry standards rapid technology developments and frequent new product introductions however many of the current competitors to chatand are software providers building their technology on the backbone of legacy hardware architecture systems and software examples of market participants attempting to migrate into chatand’s planned direction include · liveperson – legacy text chat system built for customer support · fuzemeeting – primary focus is videoconferencing · boldchat – an hosted text chat system rather than saas · whoson  talisma chat – saas and hosted text chat these competitors some of whom hold significant client bases have business models and technology that require enhancements or major overhauls as the market shifts from text based chat to the more engaging live audio and video chat technologies competitive technology video chat can be viewed as the third generation of live chat support · textbased chat original live customer support was provided using textbased chat technology initially it appeared at the request of customers on ecommerce websites but later appeared on a variety of websites and on a proactive basis offering supportive to customers during the sales process · audiobased chat this technology later became available to further engage customers on a reactive and proactive basis while the audio feature adds a second dimension to the chat experience the added value has proven minimally effective three primary competitors in addition to larger and well financed companies we believe there are three direct competitors to the chatand platform each of these competitors feature live video chat technology and a variety of other features and underlying business models that will challenge chatand in the market place · liveguide from netop this saas solution offers text audio and video chat features but does not provide a click to call feature netop is primarily a software vendor without the deep operational expertise offered by chatand to assist clients in improving sales conversion rates with its advisory services · veedesk from vee this product provides an integrated work station with expensive television quality video equipment but lacks many of the software features offered by chatand they are positioned as in integrated highend solution · liveexpert from clairvista this technology company provides a saas engagement solution that can be incorporated into client websites or operated in proprietary kiosks for onsite applications other competition in addition to the primary competitors mentioned previously there is a substantial group of small companies that are also considered competition to chatand these companies generally have niche offerings and compete on price and features although the features are generally quite similar their systems are typically older technology and are hosted solutions built for text chat while these customer engagement firms are part of the direct engagement market there are a host of potential secondary competitors that could decide to enter chatand’s marketplace · searchable knowledge management applications · email service providers · lead generation companies · web analytics and online marketing service providers · crm and other enterprise software companies · inhouse online engagement solutions · traditional offline customer service solutions such as telephone call centers competitive forces we believes that competition will increase as our current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market compared to chatand some of our larger current and potential competitors may have · stronger brand recognition · existing customer relationships · a wider range of products and services and · greater financial marketing and research and development resources additionally some competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger more established and betterfinanced companies enabling them to · undertake more extensive marketing campaigns · adopt more aggressive pricing policies · make more attractive offers to businesses to induce them to use their products or services and · develop technology innovations any change in the general market acceptance of the realtime sales marketing and customer service solution business model or in online realtime consumer advice services may harm our competitive position such changes may allow our competitors additional time to improve their service or product offerings and would also provide time for new competitors to develop realtime sales marketing customer service and web analytics applications or competitive consumer service offerings and solicit prospective clients within our target markets increased competition could result in pricing pressure reduced operating margins and loss of market share company description chatand inc intends to provide online assistance engagement and conversion solutions to ecommerce businesses by allowing realtime assistance to website visitors utilizing video conferencing screen sharing and collaborative cobrowsing to increase sales conversion rates the proposed technology platform connects businesses and their sales associates and customer service representatives csr’s with website visitors and online shoppers seeking assistance while browsing their respective websites the chat software is a  hosted no download application that

the internet by two or more people accessing the same web pages at the same time chat aims to redefine the online shopping experience by recreating virtually all of the benefits of a live showroom environment this virtual eshowroom” will allow both customers and sales support staff to navigate the website together in real time while in a video conference our technology will allow our clients and their websites to offer a more personalized and relevant sales environment the facetoface component of videochat alone is an incredibly powerful conversion tool with the addition of cobrowsing chat aims to change the landscape of ecommerce chat’s proposed video technology online cobrowsing and collaboration tools together with our ecommerce knowledge and internet marketing expertise will help our clients by increasing sales as well as customer satisfaction bridging the gap between visitor traffic and desired sales conversion goals our proposed technology aims to deliver precise and measurable returns by empowering our clients to · reduce shopping abandonment and increase sales conversion rates by intelligently interacting and engaging customers ased upon their specific behavior · increase average order values · increase customer satisfaction · reduce attrition rates of existing customers · increase quantity of line items per order · increase average total shopping cart value with the emergence of apple’s facetime skype videochat and other similar videochat applications into the mainstream and the increase in internet bandwidth wimax g sales and support has moved from a twodimensional experience simple text chat which currently dominates the support market will no longer be enough to satisfy the marketplace it is only a matter of time until videochat becomes the standard form of communication with that in mind chat intends for its application to be at the forefront of this new method of commerce communication and collaboration the company has no operating history and has not generated any revenues to date and accordingly investors will be unable to assess the company’s profitability to perform the company is in the midst of its initial phase of development we continue to develop the technology that will allow video support and chat based cobrowsing to our clients the initial version of the platform is a basic scaled down version that will allow a customer and sales representative to conduct a  video session and they will both be allowed to view the same browsing screen simultaneously there are additional features that we anticipate that will be required for us to add in later development phases that are not currently part of our platform and that some of our competitors currently offer we expect to utilize between  million minimum and  million maximum of the proceeds for technology development and up to  for investor relations the balance of the proceeds we expect to use for general working capital there are myriad potential circumstances that could be impediments to our success including our ability to be competitive in attracting qualified developers and key personnel our ability to respond to the rapid technological change and changing client preferences and the fact that we will be dependent on technology systems and thirdparty content that are beyond our control  our executive office is located at
