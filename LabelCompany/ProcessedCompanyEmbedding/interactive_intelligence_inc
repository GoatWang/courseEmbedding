truly enjoyed my job loved the people and the energy of the company it was a place to be innovative work in a fun environment and build great products the company grew from guidelines vs hard structured policies which allowed us to have an open environment where new ideas were implemented leadership also really cared about their teams and let them test their wingsconsafter  some high level positions were filled with people because of who they knew or worked with prior vs the knowledge and experience to do the job having strong innovative people work under policy driven leaders  i use that word lightly who ran from conflict or anything that forced some unwanted action is what started to sink this shiptoo many times those in vp or director roles would engage with and promote only those they liked vs those that were proven performers communication outside that favored group was nonexistent the lack of backbone these people brought to the table was at times amusing we paid a global director a  figure salary to not have any global responsibilities also had a number of vps who were rarely visible or accessible the layer of directors and managers in place for one organization was thick and cumbersome thus no support feedback or opportunity to enhance your professional development was availablei saw great people that had built great things for this company be escorted out the door like criminals because they didnt fit in the the favored group or immature managers decided it was time for them to go perhaps giving people the real reason for being removed might have helped but that would mean facing conflict which again is not an attribute inins leaders were hired on its amazing and sad what bad leaders can do to a group of solid performing employeesadvice to managementputting people who have no idea what the attributes of a true leader are or dont want to learn into high level positions was a huge mistake incorporating a  performance review is a must for any company if you want to know the real truth about what your employees are facing as its been said people dont leave companies they leave managersshare on facebookshare on

kind a regretted having to leave at the time however i have stayed in the loop of what has gone on the past year or two and it is just so sad to see how far the company has fallen please buyer or potential employee of genesys who absorbed inin beware see comments below in the cons sectionconsrecently it appears the ceo lost interest in who they put in charge of departments at inin that is the polite way of looking at it how else does one account for people in positions of power and stay in power who operate in an underhanded ways people doing jobs that they have no idea and literally no professional experience doing not to mentioned all the dishonesty involved wouldnt an interested ceo be involved enough to know when this is going on nearly whole teams have abandoned ship to avoid the downfall that is prior and in addition to the problems of merger with the new company genesys usually acquisitions mergers involve layoffs but obviously they dont even care about their employees enough to provide meaningful severance employees who have worked for the company for many years with only a token gesture of compensation and how layoffs are determined is apparently by whoever is the mangers favorite person not who has the most experience and value to the company it stinks of inexperienced unprofessional narcisstic managers who cant see beyond their own warped image of themselves

directions to go based on your strengths and interests market leader enough process to execute well and not let people mess things up but not more than what is needed smart designs and good security especially with the caas cloud offeringsconschange is the name of the game the market shifts and new technologies emerge rapidly you have to be able to change and learn new things often it means you need to trust that the leadership and visionaries in the company have perspectives that allow them chart a course in the right direction into the future and thay sometimes they will be wrong but we will learn from it and get to the right place faster recent bet the farm type investments into the cloud seem like bigger shifts than in the past but that is likely going to be one of the most important pivots the company has ever made you can always nd guess if it was too soon too much or not enough but you cannot say inin was indecisive too afraid to change or didnt have the right people to make it happenadvice to managementdo what it takes to keep inin full of the best people that means having the right incentives to keep the top talent you have to keep the people everyone loves working with the people everyone says are the reason they stay at inin that also means dropping low performers do not let the good people feel like they need to carry deadweight lastly keep listening and facilitation discussion especially the cross team collaboration getting to know leaders in different departments really builds bridges that pay dividends in ways you just cannot predict most of all it prevents silos which have historically resulted in some internal us and them which mostly arises from ignorance due to not knowing each other and not having those connections between trusted

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
