of one or more sections of the dna these alterations can have a significant impact on response to therapy eg hermrna expressiongene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional protein sequencingbased mrna analysis enables the significant multiplexing of biomarker targets eg er erccprotein expressionchanges in the protein expression as measured by ihc has been utilized for many years as the goldstandard to quantitate the actual translation of altered gene products our ability to interrogate key protein markers eg pdl her ar mgmt top

continue reading download these guidelines pdf download a pdf of paradigm’s guidelines for ffpe specimen preparation for your convenience download the pdf » smarter dnarnaprotein recovery our specimen preparation recommendations address several key factors tissue procurement and processing tissues should be fixed within one hour of surgical resection the optimal total fixation time is  hours using only neutralbuffered formalin fixed tissues should be thoroughly dehydrated prior to the embedding process block storage storage of blocks without cut faces prevents ongoing damage from exposure to oxygen water light and other environmental factors tissue type size and content excess nonmalignant starting material will result in an effective dilution of targeted nucleic acids when required paradigm employs laser capture enrichment lce to isolate and increase the specific microscopic subpopulations from ffpe tissue blocks follow these guidelines for optimal results   sample type ffpe block standard formalinfixed paraffinembedded ffpe block from most recent surgery or biopsy containing the most amount of tissue excluding bone shavescurls 0 0μm thick freshly cut curls along with he

company paradigm diagnostics inc executive summary paradigm diagnostics inc develops manufactures and distributes high throughput microbiological screening tests which are used to monitor the safety of food during processing   paradigm has developed and is currently selling diagnostic tests to the food processing industry that allow them to screen environmental samples for pathogens inhouse   the use of inplant screening tests permits greater control over haccp hazard assessment critical control point information at a lower cost to the customer traditional microbiological testing requires that tests for bacteria be selected and grown on more than one type of media agar in most cases   when using the traditional method test results are seldom available in less than  hours and when the bacteria in question is a slow grower such as listeria it can take up to five days to get test results   this time delay is further compounded when sample analysis is conducted by outside reference or central laboratories   paradigm’s products address this situation at lower cost and with less need for a fullfledged microbiology laboratory at the customer’s facility   company management dr alan olstein founded paradigm diagnostics in  and serves as the company’s chief scientific officer a mix of private and institutional investors funded the company   the company’s chief executive officer and chairman is claire johnson   paradigm’s products paradigm has developed tested received approval from the aoac research institute and is selling the first of its highthroughput pathogen screening tests   pdxlib is a 0hour test for the food pathogen listeria   the test was developed for use in the manufacturing environment as opposed to testing the food product itself   listeria is considered an “indicator” organism in the food manufacturing facility   if listeria is found it is an indication that other food pathogens may be present and sanitation operations need to be evaluated   the test allows for detection of presumptively positive samples during the selective enrichment phase of all microbiological analyses including modern immunoassay test and dna amplification methods   identification of presumptive positive samples significantly reduces the environmental sample load submitted for testing at the reference laboratory  paradigm has also developed a highthroughput test for the detection of salmonella contamination   the test is a simple single step indicator broth used to screen for salmonella and is similar in concept and execution to the pdxlib product   the product has been demonstrated to exhibit the requisite diagnostic performance parameters for sensitivity and specificity without the manipulations required of other commercially available products   this test has been shown to be effective for use in environmental screening as well as for screening end product   the test is in field trials to more accurately refine appropriate applications in the industry  paradigm is actively engaged in the development of other new diagnostics for food safety applications   the company manufactures and markets its products through a mix of direct sales and
