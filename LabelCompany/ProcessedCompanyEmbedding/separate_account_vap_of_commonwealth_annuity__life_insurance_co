portfolios have investment objectives principal investment strategies and principle risks as described in their prospectuses that are substantially similar to the corresponding existing portfolios to make those replacement portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes  information for each existing portfolio and replacement portfolio including investment objectives principal investment strategies principal risks and comparative performance history can be found in the application  applicants state that in selecting the replacement portfolios commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and maintaining a highquality menu of investment options that would offer a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed substitutions as is currently available under the contracts contract owners with contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the existing portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses immediately after the proposed substitutions as before the proposed substitutions with respect to all of the proposed substitutions the combined management fee and rule b fees paid by the replacement portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding existing portfolio the application sets forth the fees and expenses of each existing portfolio and its corresponding replacement portfolio in greater detail  applicants represent that as of the substitution date defined below the separate accounts will redeem shares of the existing portfolios for cash or inkind redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times  each substitution will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the replacement portfolios in conformity with section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contracts held by affected contract owners  contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions the obligations of the section  applicants and the rights of the affected contract owners under the contracts of affected contract owners will not be altered in any way commonwealth andor its affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including legal and accounting expenses any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses no fees or charges will be assessed to the affected contract owners to effect the substitutions the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitution than before the proposed substitution in addition the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions  the section  applicants agree that for a period of two years following the implementation of the proposed substitution the “substitution date” and for those contracts with assets allocated to the existing portfolio on the substitution date commonwealth or an affiliate thereof other than the trust will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal quarter the contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable replacement portfolio to the extent that the replacement portfolios net annual operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements for such period exceeds on an annualized basis the net annual operating expenses of the start printed page existing portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the most recently filed application commonwealth will not increase the contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the contracts for a period of at least two years following the substitution date  from the date the presubstitution notice defined below through  days following the substitution date contract owners may make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccount investing in an existing portfolio before the substitution or the replacement portfolio after the substitution to any other available subaccount under the contract without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations further on the substitution date contract values attributable to investments in each existing portfolio will be transferred to the corresponding replacement portfolio without charge and without being subject to any transfer limitations moreover commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the contracts including limitations on the future number of transfers for a period beginning at least  days before the substitution date through at least  days following the substitution date  at least  days prior to the substitution date contract owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the section  applicants received or expect to receive commission approval of the applicable proposed substitutions and of the anticipated substitution date the “presubstitution notice” presubstitution notices sent to contract owners will be filed with the commission pursuant to rule  under the  act the presubstitution notice will advise contract owners that from the date of the presubstitution notice through the date  days after the substitutions contract owners may make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccounts investing in the existing portfolios before the substitutions or the replacement portfolios after the substitutions to any other available subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations among other information the notice will inform affected contract owners that that except as described in the disruptive transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the contracts including limitations on the future number of transfers through at least  days after the substitution date additionally all affected contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable replacement portfolios at least  days before the substitution date  in addition to the supplements distributed to the contract owners within five business days after the substitution date contract owners whose assets are allocated to a replacement portfolio as part of the proposed substitutions will be sent a written notice each a “confirmation” informing them that the substitutions were carried out as previously notified the confirmation also will restate the information set forth in the presubstitution notice the confirmation will also reflect the values of the contract owners positions in the existing portfolio before the substitution and the replacement portfolio after the substitution legal analysis  the section  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the  act approving the proposed substitutions section c of the  act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the commission section c provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the  act  the section  applicants submit that the substitutions meet the standards set forth in section c and that if implemented the substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that congress intended to address when the  act was amended to include this provision applicants state that each substitution protects the contract owners who have contract value allocated to an existing portfolio by providing replacement portfolios with substantially similar investment objectives strategies and risks and providing contract owners with investment options that would have total and net annual operating expense ratios that are lower than or equal to their corresponding investment options before the substitutions  commonwealth has reserved the right under the contracts to substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current funds offered as an investment option under the contracts the contracts and the contracts prospectuses disclose this right  the section  applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the proposed substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the investment lineups that are available to contract owners while reducing expenses and continuing to provide contract owners with a wide array of investment options the section  applicants state that the proposed substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or quality of the available investment options and the proposed substitutions also will permit commonwealth to present information to its contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner the section  applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed substitutions contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under the contracts the section  applicants also assert that the proposed substitutions are not of the type that section  was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly forced redemption nor will they affect other aspects of the contracts in addition the proposed substitutions will not adversely affect any features or riders under the contracts because none of the features or riders have any investment restrictions accordingly no contract owner will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of any proposed substitution moreover the section  applicants will offer contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty other than those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect and deter disruptive transfer and other “market timing” activity that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the presubstitution notice which supplement will be delivered to the contract owners at least thirty  days before the substitution date and ending no earlier than thirty  days after the substitution date the proposed substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent in that the substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the contracts  the section  applicants request an order under section b exempting them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit the section  applicants to carry out some or all of the proposed substitutions the section  start printed page applicants state that because the proposed substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and purchases the proposed substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons  section a of the  act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the  act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company  the section  applicants state that the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the existing portfolios to the separate accounts immediately thereafter the separate accounts would purchase shares of the replacement portfolios with the portfolio securities received from the existing portfolios accordingly the section  applicants provide that to the extent commonwealth and the existing portfolios and commonwealth and the replacement portfolios are deemed to be affiliated persons of one another under section a or section a of the  act it is conceivable that this aspect of the proposed substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by section a accordingly the section  applicants have determined to seek relief from section a  the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind purchases of shares of the replacement portfolios by the separate accounts including the consideration to be paid and received as described in the application are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind transactions including the considered to be paid to each existing portfolio and received by each replacement portfolio involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a under the  act the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contract held by the affected contract owners the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions even though the separate accounts commonwealth and the trust may not rely on rule a the section  applicants believe that the rules conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons  the section  applicants also submit that the proposed inkind purchases by the separate accounts are consistent with the policies of the trust and the replacement portfolios as provided in the trusts registration statement and reports filed under the  act finally the section  applicants submit that the proposed substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act applicants conditions the section  applicants and global atlantic as applicable agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the substitutions will not be effected unless commonwealth determines that i the contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered openend investment companies in the manner contemplated by the application ii the substitutions can be consummated as described in the application under applicable insurance laws and iii any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the substitutions  after the substitution date global atlantic will not change a subadviser add a new subadviser or otherwise rely on the manager of managers order as defined in the application or any replacement order from the commission with respect to any replacement portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in subadviser the new subadviser or the replacement portfolios ability to rely on the manager of managers order or any replacement order from the commission  commonwealth or an affiliate thereof other than the trust will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including legal and accounting expenses any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses no fees or charges will be assessed to the affected contract owners to effect the substitutions the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitution than before the proposed substitution  the substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the replacement portfolios in conformity with section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contracts held by affected contract owners  the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions  the obligations of the section  applicants and the rights of the affected contract owners under the contracts of affected contract owners will not be altered in any way  affected contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccount investing in the existing portfolio before the substitution date or the replacement portfolio after the substitution date to any other available investment option under the contract without charge for a period beginning at least  days before the substitution date through at least  days following the substitution date except as described in any market timingshortterm trading provisions of the relevant prospectus the section  applicants will not exercise any rights reserved under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the contracts including limitations on the future number of transfers for a period beginning at least  days before the substitution date through at least  days following the substitution date  all affected contract owners will be notified at least  days before the substitution date about i the intended substitution of existing portfolios with the replacement portfolios ii the intended substitution date and iii information with respect to transfers as set forth in condition  start printed page above in addition the section  applicants will also deliver to affected contract owners at least thirty days before the substitution date a prospectus for each applicable replacement portfolio  the section  applicants will deliver to each affected contract owner within five business days of the substitution date a written confirmation which will include i a confirmation that the substitutions were carried out as previously notified ii a restatement of the information set forth in the presubstitution notice and iii values of the contract owners positions in the existing portfolio before the substitution and the replacement portfolio after the substitution  for a period of two years following the substitution date for contract owners who were contract owners as of the substitution date commonwealth or an affiliate thereof other than the trust will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal quarter the contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable replacement portfolio to the extent that the replacement portfolios net annual operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements for such period exceeds on an annualized basis the net annual operating expenses of the existing portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the application in addition the section

value of the principal due to realized and unrealized capital gains or losses for a specified period reduced by variable account charges and expressed as a percentage the average annual total return represents the average annual percentage change in the value of an investment in the subaccount over a given period of time it represents averaged figures as opposed to the actual performance of a

annualized yield is shown as a percentage of the investment the effective yield calculation is similar but when annualized the income earned by an investment in the subaccount is assumed to be reinvested the effective yield will be higher than the yield because of the compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment the yield of a subaccount investing in a portfolio other than the pioneer money market vct portfolio refers to the annualized income generated by an investment in the subaccount over a specified day or onemonth period the yield is calculated by assuming that the income generated by the investment during that day or onemonth period is generated each period over a month period and is shown as a percentage of the investment performance information for any subaccount

the benefit of the companys current owners disruptive trading this contract is not designed for use by individuals professional market timing organizations or other entities that engage in shortterm trading frequent transfers programmed transfers or transfers that are large in relation to the total assets of an underlying fund collectively disruptive trading these activities may require the underlying fund to maintain undesirable large cash positions or frequently buy or sell portfolio securities such transfers may dilute the value of the underlying funds shares interfere with the efficient management of the underlying funds portfolio and increase brokerage and administrative costs of the underlying funds as a result disruptive trading may adversely affect an underlying funds ability to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objectives and policies and may harm other contract owners in order to protect our contract owners and the underlying funds from potentially harmful trading activity we utilize certain policies and procedures that are designed to detect and prevent disruptive trading among the underlying funds the disruptive trading procedures our disruptive trading procedures consider certain factors in order to identify disruptive trading activity including the following  the number of transfers made over a period of time  the length of time between transfers  whether the transfers follow a pattern that appears to be designed to take advantage of short term market fluctuations particularly within certain underlying funds  the dollar amounts requested for transfers and  whether the transfers are part of a group of transfers made by a third party on behalf of several individual contract owners and  the investment objectives andor size of the underlying funds we may increase our monitoring of contract owners who engage in what we perceive to be disruptive trading including investigating the transfer patterns within multiple contracts owned by the same contract owners we may also investigate any patterns of disruptive trading identified by the underlying funds that may not have been captured by our disruptive trading procedures our disruptive trading procedures may vary from subaccount to subaccount the disruptive trading procedures limit the number of transfers a contract owner may make during a given period limit the number of times a contract owner may transfer into particular funds during a given period and place restrictions as to the time and means of transfers for example transfer instructions are required by a certain daily time cutoff among other things subject to the terms of the contract the company reserves the right to impose without prior notice additional or alternate restrictions on allocations and transfers that it determines in its sole discretion will disadvantage or potentially hurt the rights or interests of other contract owners or other holders of the underlying funds some of the underlying funds have reserved the right to temporarily or permanently refuse payments or transfer requests from the company if in the judgment of the underlying funds investment adviser the underlying fund would be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objective or policies or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected if an underlying fund refuses a transfer request from the company the company may not be able to effect certain allocations or transfers that a contract owner has requested in the future some underlying funds may impose redemption fees on shortterm trading ie  pbposth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th redemptions of mutual fund shares within a certain number of business days after purchase we reserve the right to administer and collect any such redemption fees on behalf of the underlying funds we will apply our disruptive trading procedures consistently without special arrangement waiver or exception however the companys ability to detect and deter disruptive trading and to consistently apply the disruptive trading procedures may be limited by operational systems and technological limitations contract owners seeking to engage in such transfer activities may employ a variety of strategies to avoid detection because identifying disruptive trading involves judgments that are inherently subjective the company cannot provide assurances that its disruptive trading procedures will detect every contract owner who engages in disruptive trading in addition the terms of some contracts previously issued by the company historical practices or actions litigation or certain regulatory restrictions may limit the companys ability to apply transfer or other restrictions if we are unable to detect disruptive trading or are unable to restrict disruptive trading because of contract provisions or other reasons you may experience dilution in the value of your underlying fund shares there may be increased brokerage and administrative costs within the underlying funds which may result in lower longterm returns for your investments additionally because other insurance companies andor retirement plans may invest in the underlying funds we cannot guarantee that the underlying funds will not suffer harm from disruptive trading within the variable contracts issued by other insurance companies or among investment options available to retirement plan participants under rules recently adopted by the securities and exchange commission effective april   we will be required to  enter into a written agreement with each underlying fund or its principal underwriter that will obligate us to provide to the underlying fund promptly upon request certain information about the trading activity of

applied value from time to time the company may offer its owners both fixed and variable annuity rates more favorable than those contained in the contract any such rates will be applied uniformly to all owners of the same class the dollar amount of the first periodic annuity benefit payment is calculated based upon the type of annuity option chosen as follows  for life annuity options and noncommutable fixed period certain options of ten years or more the dollar amount is determined by multiplying  the accumulated value applied under that option after application of any market value adjustment and less premium tax if any divided by  by  the applicable amount of the first monthly payment per  of value  for commutable period certain options any noncommutable fixed period certain option of less than ten years and all variable period certain options the dollar amount is determined by multiplying  the surrender value less premium taxes if any applied under that option after application of any market value adjustment and less premium tax if any divided by  by  the applicable amount of the first monthly payment per  of value  for a death benefit annuity the annuity value will be the amount of the death benefit the first periodic annuity benefit payment is based upon the accumulated value as of a date not more than four weeks preceding the date that the first annuity benefit payment is due the company transmits variable annuity benefit payments for receipt by the payee by the first of a month variable annuity benefit payments are currently based on unit values as

the value of an annuity unit in each subaccount initially was set at  the value of an annuity unit under a subaccount on any valuation date thereafter is equal to the value of such unit on the immediately preceding valuation date multiplied by the net investment factor of the subaccount for the current valuation period and divided by the assumed interest rate for the current valuation period the assumed interest rate discussed below is incorporated in the variable annuity options offered in the contract determination of the number of annuity units the dollar amount of the first variable annuity benefit payment is divided by the value of an annuity unit of the selected subaccounts to determine the number of annuity units represented by the first payment this number of annuity units remains fixed under all annuity options except the joint and twothirds survivor annuity option dollar amount of subsequent variable annuity benefit payments the dollar amount of each periodic variable annuity benefit payment after the first will vary with the value of the annuity units of the selected subaccounts the dollar amount of each subsequent variable annuity benefit payment is determined by multiplying the fixed number of annuity units derived from the dollar amount of the first payment as described above with respect to a subaccount by the value of an annuity unit of that subaccount on the applicable valuation date the variable annuity options offered by the company are based on a  assumed interest rate which affects the amounts of the variable annuity benefit payments

expense risks it has assumed the charge is imposed during both the accumulation phase and the annuity payout phase the mortality risk arises from the companys guarantee that it will make annuity benefit payments in accordance with annuity rate provisions established at the time the contract is issued for the life of the annuitant or in accordance with the annuity payout option selected no matter how long the annuitant or other payee lives and no matter how long all annuitants as a class live therefore the mortality charge is deducted during the annuity payout phase on all contracts including those that do not involve a life contingency even though the company does not bear direct mortality risk with respect to variable annuity settlement options that do not involve life contingencies the expense risk arises from the companys guarantee that the charges it makes will not exceed the limits described in the contract and in this prospectus if the charge for mortality and expense risks is not sufficient to cover actual mortality experience and expenses the company will absorb the losses if expenses are less than the amounts provided to the company by the charge the difference will be a profit to the company to the extent this charge results in a profit to the company such profit will be available for use by the company for among other things the payment of distribution sales and other expenses the mortality and expense risk charge is assessed daily at an annual rate of  of each subaccounts assets this charge may not be increased since mortality and expense risks involve future contingencies which are not subject to precise determination in advance it is not feasible to identify specifically the portion of the charge which is applicable to each

adjustment no market value adjustment will be applied to transfers withdrawals or a surrender from a guarantee period account on the expiration of its guarantee period no market value adjustment applies to amounts deducted for contract fees or rider charges in addition no negative market value adjustment will be applied to a death benefit although a positive market value adjustment if any will be applied to increase the value of the death benefit when based on the contracts accumulated value see death benefit under description of the contract all other transfers withdrawals or a surrender prior to the end of a guarantee period will be subject to a market value adjustment which may increase or decrease the account value amounts applied under an annuity option are treated as withdrawals when calculating the market value adjustment the market value adjustment will be determined by multiplying the amount taken from each guarantee period account before deduction of any surrender charge by the market value factor the market value factor for each guarantee period account is equal to ijto the power of n   where i is the guaranteed interest rate expressed as a decimal for example    being credited to the current guarantee period j is the new guaranteed interest rate expressed as a decimal for a guarantee period with a duration equal to the number of years remaining in the current guarantee period rounded to the next higher number of whole years if that rate is not available the company will use a suitable rate or index allowed by the department of insurance and n is the number of days remaining from the effective valuation date to the end of the current guarantee period based on the application of this formula if the then current market rates are lower than the rate being credited to the guarantee period account the value of a guarantee period account will increase after the market value adjustment is applied if the then current market rates are higher than the rate being credited to the guarantee period account the value of a guarantee period account will decrease after the market value adjustment is applied the market value adjustment is limited however so that even if the account value is decreased after application of a market value adjustment it will equal or exceed the owners principal plus  earnings per year less applicable contract fees conversely if the then current market rates are lower and the account value is increased after the market value adjustment is applied the increase in value is also affected by the minimum guaranteed rate of  in this situation the amount that will be added to the guarantee period account is limited to the difference between the amount earned and the  minimum guaranteed earnings for examples of how the market value adjustment works see appendix b  surrender charges and the market value adjustment program to protect principal and provide growth potential under this feature the owner elects a guarantee period and one or more subaccounts the company will then compute the proportion of the initial payment that must be allocated to the guarantee period selected assuming no transfers or

that are applicable to the guarantee period accounts the required amount then will be allocated to the preselected guarantee period account and the remaining balance to the other investment options selected by the owner in accordance with the procedures described in payments under description of the contract unless the company is notified otherwise if a subsequent payment is made after the

considerations the effect of federal income taxes on the value of a contract on withdrawals or surrenders on annuity benefit payments and on the economic benefit to the owner annuitant or beneficiary depends upon a variety of factors the following discussion is based upon the companys understanding of current federal income tax laws as they are interpreted as of the date of this prospectus no representation is made regarding the likelihood of continuation of current federal income tax laws or of current interpretations by the irs in addition this discussion does not address state or local tax consequences that may be associated with the contract it should be recognized that the following discussion of federal income tax aspects of amounts paid into and received from a contract is not exhaustive does not purport to cover all situations and is not intended as tax advice a qualified tax adviser always should be consulted with regard to the application of law to individual circumstances general the company the company is taxed as a life insurance company under subchapter l of the code the company files a consolidated tax return with its affiliates the variable account is considered a part of and taxed with the operations of the company and is not taxed as a separate entity as of the date of this prospectus the variable account and subaccounts are not subject to tax but the company reserves the right to make a charge for any future tax liability it may incur as a result of the existence of the contract the variable account or the subaccounts or for any tax imposed on the company with respect to the income or assets of the contract the variable account or the subaccounts held by the company any such charge for taxes will be assessed against the variable account or the subaccounts on a fair and equitable basis in order to preserve equity among classes of owners and with respect to each subaccount account as though that subaccount were a separate taxable entity diversification requirements section h of code provides that the underlying investments held under a nonqualified annuity contract must satisfy certain diversification requirements in order for the contract to be treated as an annuity contract if these requirements are not met the owner will be taxed each year on the annual increase in accumulated valued unless a waiver of the diversification failure is obtained from the irs the irs has issued regulations under section h of the code relating to the diversification requirements for variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts the regulations prescribed by the treasury department provide that the investments of a segregated asset account underlying a variable annuity contract are adequately diversified if no more than  of the value of the assets of such account is represented by any one investment no more than  by any two investments no more than  by any three investments and no more than  by any four investments these diversification requirements must be applied separately to each subaccount the company believes that the underlying funds will comply with the current diversification requirements so that a nonqualified contract that invests in one or more of those funds will not be disqualified from annuity contract treatment by section h of the code in the event that future irs regulations andor rulings would require contract modifications in order to remain in compliance with the diversification standards the company will make reasonable efforts to comply and it reserves the right to make such changes as it deems appropriate for that purpose owner control in some circumstances owners of variable contracts who retain excessive control over the investment of the underlying separate account assets may be treated as the owners of those assets and may be subject to tax on income produced by those assets although published guidance in this area does not address certain aspects of the contracts we believe that the owner of a contract should not be treated as the owner of any assets in the separate account we reserve the right to modify the contracts to bring them into conformity with applicable standards should such modification be necessary to prevent owners of the policies from being treated as the owners of the underlying separate account assets  pbposth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th in order for a nonqualified variable annuity contract to qualify for tax deferral assets in the segregated accounts underlying the contract must be considered to be owned by the insurance company and not by the contract owner in three revenue rulings issued before the enactment of section h of the code in  the irs held that where a variable contract owner had certain forms of actual or potential control over the investments held under the variable annuity contract the contract owner rather than the issuing insurance company would be treated as the owner and would be taxable on the income and gains produced by those assets qualified and nonqualified contracts from a federal tax viewpoint there are two broad categories of variable annuity contracts qualified contracts and nonqualified contracts a qualified contract is one that is purchased in connection with a taxqualified retirement plan or program eligible for special tax treatment under the code a nonqualified contract is one that is not purchased in connection with a retirement plan or program eligible for special tax treatment the tax treatment for certain withdrawals or surrenders will vary depending on whether they are made from a qualified contract or a nonqualified contract for more information on the tax provisions applicable to qualified contracts see provisions applicable only to tax qualified plans below taxation of the contract in general the company believes that the contract described in this prospectus with certain exceptions see nonnatural owner below will be considered an annuity contract under section  of the code which governs the taxation of annuities and if the contract is a qualified contract certain other provisions of the code that will apply to it however if the owner of a nonqualified contract chooses an annuity date beyond the owners life expectancy it is possible that the contract may not be considered an annuity for tax purposes because there is no reasonable basis for expecting that annuity payments will ever be made under the contract in that event the owner would be taxed on the annual increase in accumulated value under the contract the owner should consult a qualified tax adviser for more information the following discussion assumes that a contract will be treated as an annuity contract subject to section  and in the case of a qualified contract any other applicable provisions of the code mandatory distribution requirements for qualified contracts under section a of the code qualified contracts will generally be subject both to mandatory minimum distribution requirements upon attainment of age   by the owner and to mandatory death benefit distribution requirements upon the death of the owner either before or after the commencement of benefit payments note the rules for roth iras do not currently require distributions to begin during the owners lifetime to comply with section a taxqualified plans must include a provision for the commencement of benefits when a participant attains age   or under certain plans when the participant retires if later the regulations under section a provide that if the minimum distribution requirements are applicable to an annuity contract for any year in which annuity payments have not yet commenced on an irrevocable basis except for acceleration the required minimum distribution for that year must be computed by determining the entire interest of the owner in the contract as of the prior december  and dividing that amount by the applicable distribution period as determined under the regulations the regulations further provide that if the minimum distribution requirements are applicable to an annuity contract for any year in which annuity payments have commenced on an irrevocable basis payments under such contract must generally be nonincreasing according to the regulations payments will not fail to satisfy the nonincreasing payment requirement merely because payments are increased in one or more of the following ways  by a constant percentage applied not less frequently than annually  to provide a final payment upon the death of the employee that does not exceed the excess of the total value being annuitized over the total payments before the death of the employee

payment of the annuity over the remaining period of the annuity beginning no later than the year following the year for which the actuarial experience is measured and  an acceleration of payments under the annuity which is defined as a shortening of the payment period with respect to an annuity or a full or partial commutation of the future annuity payments an increase in the payment amount will be treated as an acceleration of payments in the annuity only if the total future expected payments under the annuity including the amount of any payment made as a result of the acceleration is decreased as a result of the change in payment period some forms of annuity payments permitted under the contract may not meet the requirements under the final regulations issued pursuant to section a in the event that future irs regulations andor rulings would require contract modifications in order for distributions to the owner to remain in compliance with these distribution requirements the company will make reasonable efforts to comply and it reserves the right to make such changes as it deems appropriate for that purpose to comply with section a of the code taxqualified plans must also include provisions for the distribution of plan benefits after the death of the participant if the surviving spouse of the participant is the beneficiary subject to the terms of such a plan section a permits the surviving spouse to defer the commencement of benefits until he or she reaches age   at which time the minimum distribution requirements will apply as though the spouse were a plan participant if the beneficiary of a qualified contract is not the participants surviving spouse the operation of the death benefit distribution requirements of section a will depend upon whether annuity payments have commenced if the participant dies and annuity payments have commenced the entire remaining interest must be distributed to the beneficiary at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of the participants death if the participant dies before annuity payments have commenced the entire interest must be distributed to the beneficiary either i within five years after the participants death andor ii in distributions that commence within one year after the date of death and are made in substantially equal amounts over a period not extending beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary if a beneficiary intends to comply with the substantially equal payment requirements without electing annuity payments the required minimum distribution for any year must be computed by determining the entire interest of the owner in the contract as of the prior december  and dividing that amount by the life expectancy of the owner and beneficiary as determined under the regulations if the beneficiary intends to comply with the requirement by electing to receive annuity payments these payments must satisfy the nonincreasing payment requirement discussed above some forms of annuity payments offered under the contract may not satisfy these requirements in the event that future irs regulations andor rulings would require contract modifications in order for distributions to a beneficiary to remain in compliance with these distribution requirements the company will make reasonable efforts to comply and it reserves the right to make such changes as it deems appropriate for that purpose mandatory distribution requirements for nonqualified contracts under section s of the code a nonqualified annuity contract must contain specified provisions with respect to the distribution of the amounts held under the contract following the death of the contract owner if this requirement is not met the owner will be taxed each year on the annual increase in accumulated value this contract contains provisions that are designed to meet the requirements of section s under section s if the deceased owners surviving spouse is the beneficiary the surviving spouse may retain the contract and continue deferral during his or her lifetime if the beneficiary of the contract is not the deceased owners surviving spouse the specific

in  the irs held that distributions made to the designated beneficiary under a nonqualified variable annuity contract under a procedure that provided for payments over the life expectancy of the beneficiary would qualify under the substantially equal procedure described in  above even though the beneficiary had the right to accelerate payments under the distribution procedure so long as the payments continued automatically unless and until such an acceleration occurred in the event that future irs regulations andor rulings would require contract modification in order to remain in compliance with these distribution requirements the company will make reasonable efforts to comply and it reserves the right to make such changes as it deems appropriate for that purpose withdrawals prior to annuitization with certain exceptions increases in the contracts accumulated value are not taxable to the owner until withdrawn from the contract under the current provisions of the code amounts received or deemed to have been received under an annuity contract prior to annuitization including payments made upon the death of the annuitant or owner generally are first allocable to any investment gains credited to the contract over the taxpayers investment in the contract and to that extent are treated as ordinary income subject to federal income taxation for this purpose the investment in the contract is the total of all payments to the contract that were not excluded from the owners income less any amounts previously withdrawn from the contract which were excluded from income as recovery of the investment in the contract for purposes of computing the taxable amount of any distribution under these rules section eaii requires that all nonqualified deferred annuity contracts issued by the same insurance company to the same owner during a single calendar year be treated as one contract different rules may apply to qualified contracts annuity payouts after annuitization after annuity benefit payments begin under the contract a portion of each such payment received may generally be excluded from income as a recovery of the investment in the contract different formulas apply to the computation of the excludable portion with respect to fixed annuity payments and with respect to variable annuity payments but the general effect of both formulas is to allocate the exclusion from income for the investment in the contract ratably over the period during which annuity payments will be received all annuity payments received in excess of this excludable amount are taxable as ordinary income once the investment in the contract is fully recovered because payments under the contract have continued for longer than expected the entire amount of all future payments will be taxable if the annuitant dies before the entire investment in the contract is recovered a deduction for the remaining amount is generally allowed on the annuitants final tax return penalty on early distributions under section q of the code a  penalty tax may be imposed on the withdrawal of investment gains from a nonqualified contract if the withdrawal is made prior to age   a

sfas no  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under sfas no  are described below basis of fair value measurement level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities level  quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly level  prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable a financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement see note o  new and adopted accounting pronouncements for a discussion of the impact of adopting sfas no  in determining fair value the company separates its financial instruments into two categories cash instruments and derivative contracts see note d  cash instruments and note e  derivatives and hedging activities below d cash instruments the companys cash instruments are generally classified within level  or level  of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include most us government and agency securities many other sovereign government obligations and most money market securities such instruments are generally classified within level  of the fair value hierarchy the company does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments even in situations where the company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price the types of instruments valued based on quoted prices in markets that are not active broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency include most investmentgrade and highyield corporate bonds most mortgage products state and municipal obligations such instruments are generally classified within level  of the fair value hierarchy certain cash instruments are classified within level  of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency such instruments include private equity and subordinated obligations the transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of fair value accordingly when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument the model is adjusted so that the model value at inception equals the transaction price this valuation is adjusted only when changes to inputs and assumptions are corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments completed or pending thirdparty transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities subsequent rounds of financing recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure offerings in the equity or debt capital markets and changes in financial ratios or cash flows for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity andor nontransferability and

annuity and life insurance company a whollyowned subsidiary of the goldman sachs group inc notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december    summary of significant accounting policies continued e derivatives and hedging activities derivative contracts can be exchangetraded or overthecounter otc exchangetraded derivatives typically fall within level  or level  of the fair value hierarchy depending on whether they are deemed to be actively traded or not the company generally values exchangetraded derivatives within portfolios using models which calibrate to market clearing levels and eliminate timing differences between the closing price of the exchangetraded derivatives and their underlying cash instruments in such cases exchangetraded derivatives are classified within level  of the fair value hierarchy as of the transaction the company entered into certain otc derivatives primarily equity put options and interest rate swaptions to hedge certain equity market credit and interest rate risk none of these posttransaction instruments qualify for hedge accounting and are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value otc derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible including marketbased inputs to models model calibration to market clearing transactions broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency where models are used the selection of a particular model to value an otc derivative depends upon the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market the firm generally uses similar models to value similar instruments valuation models require a variety of inputs including contractual terms market prices yield curves credit curves measures of volatility prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets such as generic forwards swaps and options model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment such instruments are typically classified within level  of the fair value hierarchy certain otc derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently more difficult such instruments are classified within level  of the fair value hierarchy where the company does not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of fair value accordingly when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument the model is adjusted so that the model value at inception equals the transaction price the valuations of these less liquid otc derivatives are typically based on level  andor level  inputs that can be observed in the market as well as unobservable level  inputs subsequent to initial recognition the company updates the level  and level  inputs to reflect observable market changes with resulting gains and losses reflected within level  level  inputs are only changed when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions thirdparty pricing services andor broker or dealer quotations or other empirical market data in circumstances where the company cannot verify the model value to market transactions it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value when appropriate valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity bidoffer spreads and credit considerations such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence in the absence of such evidence managements best estimate is used in november  per an investment management agreement with goldman sachs asset management lp gsam the company began to trade futures contracts exchangetraded futures and options are effected through a regulated exchange and positions are marked to market on a daily basis the company has little exposure to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such financial instruments from time to time futures contracts are terminated the termination of such contracts would be recognized in income as they are marked to market on a daily basis terminations would not materially impact earnings as any payment due upon termination represents one day of market exposure the clearinghouse guarantees the performance of both counterparties which mitigates credit risk prior to the transaction the company formally documented all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions this process included linking all derivatives that were designated as fair value cash flow or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions the company also formally assessed both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that were used in hedging transactions were highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items when it was determined that a derivative was not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge the company discontinued hedge accounting prospectively as discussed below

accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions when the risk transfer provisions of sfas no  accounting and reporting for reinsurance of shortduration and longduration contracts have been met to meet risk transfer requirements a long duration reinsurance contract must transfer mortality or morbidity risks and subject the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss with respect to ceded reinsurance the valuation of claims recoverable depends on whether the underlying claim is a reported claim or a future policy benefit for reported claims the company values reinsurance recoverables at the time the underlying claim is recognized in accordance with contract terms for future policy benefits the company estimates the amount of reinsurance recoverables based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance recovery information and applies that information to the future policy benefit estimates the reinsurance recoverables are based on what the company believes are reasonable estimates and the balance is disclosed separately in the financial statements however the ultimate amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all claims are settled reinsurance contracts do not relieve the company from its obligations to policyholders failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the company
