description               shareholder letter dated march         exhibit    click to enlarge    shady grove road suite  rockville md      march     dear shareholder   we would like to take this time to report on the business activities and accomplishments of regenerx in  and the clinical milestones that we expect to reach in  this letter will provide an update on our various partnerships clinical trials and operations we reserve the right to modify our goals and expectations from time to time in accordance with clinical developments partnering activities access to capital markets and the general climate in the pharmaceutical industry   to continue our efficient use of capital consistent with our longstanding goals regenerx has employed a strategy of leveraging clinical assets by engaging in product development through commercial partnerships over the past year we have also continued to support innovative research with development with thymosin beta  “tβ” by working with leading academic and medical institutions in the us and europe where research intended to explore potential new uses of thymosin beta  in various diseases and disorders is being performed   product development and commercialization deals   as noted in previous letters to stockholders we embarked on a strategy to outlicense rights to our product candidates in markets that would be difficult or impossible for us to develop internally this led to the outlicensing of certain product candidates in china korea japan and australia among other asian countries two years ago we entered into a joint venture regentree llc to develop our ophthalmic assets in the us last year we expanded the joint venture territory to include canada as further described below   in  we licensed to lee’s pharmaceuticals a successful and fastgrowing chinese pharmaceutical company the rights to develop and commercialize our tβ products in china hong kong macau and taiwan in return we received an upfront licensing fee and commercial milestone payments and a tiered royalty stream if lee’s is successful in bringing a product to market lee’s is responsible for all clinical development and commercialization activities in their territory we believe that the terms of this license provides regenerx with an opportunity for value enhancement without capital risk and dilution to stockholders in the summer of  after review of all of our fda filings preparation of a clinical dossier and manufacturing development lee’s filed an ind with the chinese fda “cfda” to conduct a phase ii doseresponse study in mainland china in patients with dry eye syndrome as many of you know there is a growing and significant pollution problem that is often an underlying cause of dry eye and other related disorders that affect large urban populations in china in  the cfda declined lee’s ind because the clinical trial drug product rgn was manufactured by regenerx outside of china which substantially affected the proposed start of the trial during this past year the cfda reversed its ruling which we believe positively affects the proposed dry eye trial lee’s is in the process of preparing new documentation for the cfda with the hope to initiate a phase ii clinical trial in patients with dry eye syndrome later this year     page       in  we licensed to gtreebnt “gtree” a korean pharmaceutical company the rights to develop and commercialize rgn regenerx’s preservativefree eye drop in korea japan australia and a number of other countries in asia that we refer to as the pan asian rights these rights exclude china hong kong macau and taiwan which are held by lee’s in return we received an upfront licensing fee and gtree purchased equity in regenerx gtree holds approximately  of our outstanding common stock we also licensed gtree the rights to develop rgn regenerx’s dermal wound healing product in the us for epidermolysis bullosa “eb” an inherited orphan indication causing blistering of the skin most recently gtree received the greenlight from the fda to begin a  patient randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled phase iii trial of rgn in the us gtree plans to initiate this trial in q of    gtree has assembled an impressive team with strong product development expertise in the pharmaceutical industry in korea and believes that if rgn andor rgn are approved in the us it will not have to conduct additional clinical trials in korea and will be able to receive korean marketing approval based on the us data   in january of  we entered into a joint venture with gtree “regentree llc” which licensed rgn in the us for the treatment of dry eye syndrome “des” and chronic neurotrophic keratopathy “nk” an orphan condition of the cornea we chose to enter this venture for several reasons including demonstration by gtree of technical and product development competency and a willingness to put forth the necessary time effort and capital in  we added canada to the us joint venture for a sum of  no other terms of the jv were modified   we believe the joint venture is a uniquely appropriate structure within which to develop rgn regenerx currently owns  of the equity of regentree while gtree will earn additional equity based on achieving critical developmental milestones in addition to the equity stake regenerx will also receive a single to double digit royalty on commercial sales by regentree we estimate regenerx’s equity ownership in regentree along with our royalty rights will result in a share of the eventual commercial value of the joint venture of approximately  if regentree’s rights to rgn are licensed or sold to a third party or if it is commercialized internally through the joint venture we estimate that the cost for development of rgn for nk and dry eye syndrome in the us is    million and we structured the joint venture so that regenerx has no financial obligations throughout the entire development process through receipt of nda approval moreover regenerx retains significant control over major decisions within regentree such as commercialization strategy mergers acquisitions etc given the rapidly increasing value of the dry eye market in the us we believe this is an excellent opportunity to effectively develop rgn in the us with a partner that has the interest expertise and financial capabilities to achieve timely success without financial obligation or risk to regenerx     page       important clinical milestones anticipated in    during  we and our partners expect to reach several clinical milestones which we believe should add significant value to regenerx   · in the us we expect the completion of regentree’s phase iii trials in dry eye syndrome and neurotrophic keratopathy   · in china based on our discussions with lee’s pharmaceuticals we believe initiation of lee’s phase ii clinical trial in dry eye will happen this year   · in the us our partner gtreebnt is planning a phase iii  patient randomized placebocontrolled trial of rgn in patients with eb in the third quarter of     market for rgn in the us and china   the market to treat dry eye syndrome is large and growing the current worldwide dry eye market is estimated to be well over  billion per year and continues to rapidly expand to date two pharmaceutical products have been approved in the us for dry eye syndrome and the market is well over  billion   with one of the approved drugs patients often experience burning and stinging from its use which commonly takes six months until efficacy is seen the package insert indicates that clinical trials have demonstrated that the product is effective in  of patients vs  for placebo   with the other approved drug the most common side effects are irritation discomfort dysgeusia foul taste in mouth and decreased visual acuity the drug is to be used for twelve weeks   in contrast clinical data for rgn shows that its effects are achieved within days that there is no burning or stinging and that it can significantly improve both the signs and symptoms of dry eye which represent the current standards required by fda for approval of new products for dry eye   in china a quickly expanding economy has led to severe pollution in its urban areas and to a rapidly expanding incidence of dry eye symptomology among its population it is believed that the market share for drugs for these indications is around  of china’s ophthalmic drug market with an estimated market value of approximately  billion in  and a projected growth rate of  annually through    nk is an orphan disease in the us and eu meeting the statutory threshold of fewer than  diagnosed cases in each territory as an orphan drug rgn would be eligible for a number of benefits including expanded exclusivity premium pricing and certain tax benefits on december   the fda granted orphan status for tβ for the treatment of nk in the us     page       patents   we have numerous patents throughout the world for our product candidates and we continue to develop our intellectual property portfolio as we constantly monitor our portfolio we sometimes pare down any patents or patent applications that we do not feel are pertinent to our or our partners’ product interests in some cases our partners have independently filed new or improved patent applications related to our product candidates as has recently been the case with respect to rgn in these cases the patent applications and future patents are designed to enhance our product exclusivity andor protect other aspects of our technologies regenerx retains the right to license such intellectual property for our own use in territories outside of a licensed territory typically on a royaltyfree basis which is similar to our retained rights to any data generated by our licensees from their development of our product candidates this of course could be of substantial benefit to our company in the future   operations fundraising and future plans   currently regenerx has active partnerships in three major territories the us china and pan asia in each case the cost of development is being borne by our partners with no financial obligation for regenerx    we still have significant clinical assets to develop primarily rgn injectable formulation of tβ for cardiac and cns disorders in the us pan asia and europe and rgn in the eu we are also seeking to outlicense rgn in asia and europe our goal is to wait until the results are obtained from the current clinical trials before seeking a partner for the eu for rgn if successful this should allow us to obtain a higher value for the asset at that time and enhance our strategy to obtain partners in currently unlicensed territories   on june   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor pursuant to which we agreed to sell an aggregate of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock we received approximately  in net proceeds from the  offering these funds have been used for general operating expenses including intellectual property development and maintenance regulatory compliance sec and otc filings legal and accounting and investor relations among others   as of september   we had approximately  million in cash based on our preliminary operating budget we believe we have funds to last into approximately the beginning of q  this estimate does not include receipt of any funds from grants new partnerships or the raising of additional capital if the market climate warrants we continuously monitor our cash use as well as the clinical timelines we will need to secure additional operating capital in  and are evaluating options including the licensing of certain additional rights to commercialize our clinical products as well as raising capital through the capital markets one possibility would be to file an s registration statement to be prepared to sell shares to investors at an appropriate opportunity ideally when our clinical trials are successfully completed     page       investor relations   we have been investing additional resources on investor relations in order to present our story to a broader retail investor market as well as to institutional investors and analysts we have attended and spoken at investor and industry conferences and authorized our investor relations firm to initiate a social media program to expand our reach we intend to continue to expand this initiative as we move closer to completion of our phase iii clinical trials   it is our belief that the market valuation of regenerx at approximately  million is far below comparable companies as well as those with product candidates in much earlier stages of clinical development we also believe that if we can effectively present regenerx as a company that has worldwide product opportunities in advanced clinical trials for both large markets and orphan disorders with nearterm clinical milestones and little financial risk to regenerx we should appeal to a broad spectrum of investors in the biopharmaceutical space we also believe that if we can move to a national exchange we would be able to attract a much broader group of investors thus increasing visibility and liquidity this objective will be considered at the appropriate time and under the appropriate circumstances   conclusion   we believe we have developed a compelling combination of assets partnerships and products worldwide that are in latestage clinical development for a number of medical disorders with unmet needs that offer the potential for significant financial returns in a relatively short period of time in  rgn should be reaching important milestones with the completion of our phase iii trials in the us for patients with dry eye syndrome and the orphan eye disease nk we are encouraged that the positive changes in the chinese fda’s regulations will allow our partner to initiate its phase ii trial for dry eye syndrome in china and are pleased that gtreebnt has been given the permission from the fda to begin the first phase iii trial of rgn in patients with eb   we believe each successful trial will generate attention and enthusiasm among patients physicians and investors and help increase the value of our company to a level we believe is consistent with the clinical stage and potential value of our product portfolio we are very appreciative of the continued support of our shareholders and are pleased to share our recent good news with you   best regards   s jj finkelstein s allan l goldstein     jj finkelstein allan l goldstein phd president  ceo chairman and chief scientific advisor   page         forward looking
