four longterm investment funds the founder dr john p hussman personally invests most of his liquid assets into the hussman funds most of the board of directors invest significant portions of their assets in hussman funds as well the top total return fund is the hussman strategic total return fund hstrx the fund invests primarily in conservative fixedincome instruments including bonds us treasury bonds strips mortgagebacked securities mbs and investmentgrade corporate debt rated bbb or higher by standard and poors sp and moodys investors service inc the fund may invest up to  of assets internationally in precious metals mining stocks energy securities real estate investment trusts reits and exchangetradedfunds etfs as well as foreign commodities currencies and government debt the fund has  million in assets and generated a  average annual return aar since inception on sept   as of march   the fund has a  expense ratio with a  minimum initial investment and  for an individual retirement account ira the following is a closer look into the hussman strategic total return fund bond holdings the fund holdings fall into two main categories bonds and stocks the bond

investment management insights strategies and solutions our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional alternative and nonfinancial assets we can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs portfolio consulting a collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager your portfolio manager is a key member of your us trust relationship team and serves as your personal chief investment officer he or she will work with you to create an investment policy statement which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your objectives risk tolerance cash flow needs tax situation wealth aspirations your portfolio managers ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking most relevant research analysis current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio he or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your investment policy statement which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals asset management a more complete approach to asset allocation we analyze a wide range of asset classes including hedge and private equity funds and global investment opportunities as potential components of an asset allocation in addition we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid your asset allocation will be based on the longterm expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals over the shorter term however your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks and reflecting us trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you how you own your assets — personally or in trusts in taxable or taxexempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio at us trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves alternative investments sophisticated

participants we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange interest rate commodity and equity markets derivativebased transactions target the risks you seek to hedge and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies  asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets  alternative investments such as derivatives hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments before you invest in alternative investments you should consider your overall financial situation how much money you have to invest your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk  nonfinancial assets such as closelyheld businesses real estate oil gas and mineral properties and timber farm and ranch land are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value special risk considerations include natural events for example earthquakes or fires
