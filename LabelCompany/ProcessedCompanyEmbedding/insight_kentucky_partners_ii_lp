brief for the kentucky bankers association before dixon nickell and taylor judges opinion dixon judge appellant insight kentucky partners ii lp appeals from a judgment of the jefferson circuit court following a jury trial finding it liable to appellee preferred automotive services inc for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty by jerry key preferreds former general manager preferred has filed a crossappeal challenging the trial courts reduction of the jurys award of punitive damages as well as the denial of preferreds motion to amend its complaint to add a trade secrets claim for the reasons set forth herein we reverse and remand the matter for a new trial preferred was formed in  to provide vehicle repair and maintenance services brothers brian payne and jack payne together owned eighty percent of preferred with key owning the remaining twenty percent key was responsible for all of preferreds daily operations preferreds corporate report filed with kentuckys secretary of state identified key as president vicepresident treasurer and sole director soon after preferreds formation insight began using preferred for all of its local vehicle fleet maintenance and repair work key was the primary contact and managed all of insights business with preferred during the time period that preferred provided services to insight bob mathena and todd knight were the insight employees responsible for the companys vehicle fleet maintenance it is undisputed that preferred and insight never entered into any type of contract in june  the paynes accused key of embezzling from preferred rather than terminate key however the paynes chose to take over all financial responsibilities although key continued to manage the other daily operations however preferreds annual corporate report filed in july  identified brian payne as president jack payne as vicepresident and both paynes as the only directors of preferred key was listed only as a shareholder preferreds  annual report contained the same information except that key was no longer identified in any capacity on january   the paynes again accused key of embezzling money from preferred key contended that he was terminated on that date and never returned to or had any further responsibilities with preferred indeed the record herein contains preferreds payroll records reflecting that key was terminated  as well as a letter dated february   from brian payne to preferreds vendors stating that key is no longer employed by preferred automotive as of january   in addition payne testified at trial that key had no authority to do anything on preferreds behalf after january   nevertheless preferred claimed that key was not terminated on january th but rather took time off to think about the situation and intended to return to work preferred contended that despite its records to the contrary key in fact remained an employee until january   because he had a company cell phone and insurance benefits until that date as well as remained a corporate director until  sometime between january th and january th key met with mathena and knight and discussed the possibility of insight moving its business if key obtained employment elsewhere at the end of january  key met with robert johnson the owner of southside automotive and arranged to rent a building to start a vehicle fleet maintenance business to compete with preferred key hired two of preferreds longtime mechanics and began operations under the name of southside automotive around the middle of february  insight began sending some of its vehicles to southside at the same time insight also increased its use of other vendors including nationwide truck service for maintenance work jim berry collision center for body work and mosby towing for towing services in march  a billing dispute arose between preferred and insight specifically in a march th letter to bob mathena brian payne accused insight of defamation by passing rumors that preferred was double billing and otherwise cheating insight as evidenced through a string of internal emails insight thereafter made the decision to terminate its relationship with preferred noting specifically that there was no contract prohibiting it from doing so in june  preferred filed an action against key asserting breach of fiduciary duty conversion and fraud that lawsuit was settled in  preferred thereafter filed a lawsuit against southside and johnson in august  alleging aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty misappropriation of trade secrets and tortious interference that lawsuit similarly settled in november  in january  preferred filed the instant action against insight alleging that insight  tortiously interfered with a noncompete agreement between key and preferred and  aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty owed by key to preferred a nineday jury trial was held beginning january   preferred sought  in lost profit damages despite not having a contract preferred based its damages upon the assumption that insight would have continued to send all of its business to preferred from the time preferred lost insight as a customer in  until  preferred also sought  million in punitive damages at the close of preferreds proof the trial court granted insights motion for a directed verdict on the tortious interference claim with respect to the aiding and abetting claim preferred asserted that insight knew that key owed fiduciary obligations to preferred and it nonetheless helped key breach that duty by assisting him in establishing a new business to compete with preferred and by encouraging key to utilize confidential information he obtained from preferred for insights benefit and to the detriment of preferred at the close of evidence the jury found that insight aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty owed by key to preferred and awarded  million in compensatory damages and  million in punitive damages the trial court apportioned the compensatory damages  to key  to insight and  to preferred as a result the original trial judgment awarded preferred  million in damages insight thereafter filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov as well as motions to alter amend or vacate the judgment and for a new trial following an extensive hearing the trial court denied the jnov and new trial motions however the trial court granted the motion to alter amend or vacate in part by reducing the punitive damages award from  million to  motion on the grounds that the award was the result of passion prejudice andor bias as to insights financial status and sympathy for employees of preferred given insights degree of reprehensibility and the lack of contact between the parties insight then appealed to this court preferred has filed a crossappeal on several issues additional facts are set forth as necessary before we turn to the issues herein we would note that this case involved a nineday trial and a voluminous record the hearing on insights posttrial motions lasted over two hours and involved a multitude of issues yet the trial court made no rulings from the bench nor did it include any findings or rationale in its orders denying the motions for jnov and new trial in certainteed corporation v dexter  swd   ky  our supreme court in reviewing an appeal from a trial court order granting a new trial commented the reason appellate courts defer to the trial courts decision to grant a new trial is because the decision may depend on factors that do not readily appear in the appellate record such as witness demeanor and observations of the jury    but that deference does not make such decisions beyond review thus it is crucial that the factors going into the decision appear somewhere in the trial record or else there may be no record of them at all even if the record is complete the trial judges evaluation of this evidence recorded as findings of fact in support of the decision are just as important at least from the appellate perspective otherwise an appellate court has to sift through a voluminous record to see what possibly could have been the basis for the ruling which wastes judicial resources and begs for erroneous reversals in this case for example the trial court simply found that the jurys verdict in the first trial was manifestly unsupported by the evidence and manifestly a product of jury passion and prejudice while these are findings of fact of a sort they lack of any discussion of the evidence supporting them which makes their review difficult though cr kentucky rules if civil procedure  does not currently require them the better practice is for a trial court to include in its order at least some specific findings regarding the evidence or lack of evidence that supports the ultimate decision to grant or deny the motion for a new trial admittedly our review of this matter has been made more difficult because of the absence of any findings or reasoning supporting the trial courts rulings on the posttrial motions given the complexity of this case the trial courts evaluation of evidence and factors not readily apparent from the record would have greatly benefitted this court in our review with that we now turn to the issues presented directed verdictjnov insight first argues that the trial courts judgment should be vacated because preferred failed to prove the necessary elements of aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty as such insight contends that the trial court erred in failing to grant its motions for a directed verdict andor jnov the standard of review regarding a motion for a directed verdict or jnov has been described as a difficult one for an appellant to meet peters v wooten  swd   ky app  in taylor v kennedy  swd  ky app  a panel of this court described it as follows in ruling on either a motion for a directed verdict or a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict a trial court is under a duty to consider the evidence in the strongest possible light in favor of the party opposing the motion furthermore it is required to give the opposing party the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference which can be drawn from the evidence and it is precluded from entering either a directed verdict or judgment nov unless there is a complete absence of proof on a material issue in the action or if no disputed issue of fact exists upon which reasonable men could differ id at  citation omitted in reviewing evidence supporting a judgment entered upon a jury verdict the role of an appellate court is limited to determining whether the trial court erred in failing to grant the motion for a directed verdict or jnov see bierman v klapheke  swd  ky  ncaa v hornung  swd  ky  all evidence which favors the prevailing party must be taken as true and the reviewing court is not at liberty to determine credibility or the weight which should be given to the evidence these being functions reserved to the trier of fact we may not disturb the trial courts ruling unless the decision is clearly erroneous peters v wooten  swd   ky app  citing bierman  swd at  as such a denial of a directed verdict or jnov should only be reversed on appeal when it is shown that the verdict was palpably or flagrantly against the evidence such that it indicates the jury reached the verdict as a result of passion or prejudice id citation omitted kentucky follows the restatement second of torts §  in defining the elements of aiding and abetting to prevail on a claim of aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty a plaintiff must prove the following elements  the existence and breach of a fiduciary relationship  the defendant gave the breaching party substantial assistance or encouragement in effectuating the breach and  the defendant knew that the partys conduct breached that fiduciary duty miles farm supply llc v helena chem co  fd   th cir  citations omitted applying kentucky law insight claims as it did in the trial court that preferred failed to prove any of the above elements preferred had to first prove that key breached a fiduciary duty a claim for breach of fiduciary duty requires that a plaintiff allege that  the defendant owes a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff  the defendant breached that duty and  the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the breach fastenal co v crawford  fsuppd   e d ky  the scope of the fiduciary duty has been variously defined as one requiring utter good faith or honesty loyalty or obedience as well as candor due care and fair dealing lach v man owar llc  swd   ky  quoting anthony v padmar inc  sed   sc ct app  preferred alleged that while key was still a fiduciary he  formed southside to compete with preferred  misappropriated preferreds confidential information about insights vehicle fleet and  hired preferreds key employees preferred also argued that key breached his fiduciary duties throughout the tenure of his employment by diverting resources to insight in the form of free service perks to insight employees and gift cards to mathena and knight insight contends that the evidence at trial affirmatively established that key was not a fiduciary after january   when he was terminated from preferred insight relies upon the decision in aero drapery of kentucky inc v engdahl  swd   ky  wherein the court held that the end of a fiduciary relationship coincides with the termination of actual responsibilities insight points out that even if preferreds position that key was not terminated until january   is taken as true preferred nonetheless conceded that he had no responsibilities or authority to act on behalf of preferred after january   consequently insight argues that key did not breach any fiduciary duty to preferred as insight notes settled law permits an employee to prepare to compete with his employer before leaving the company provided the employee does not act unfairly or otherwise injure his principal before the departure miles farm supply llc  fd at  further a fiduciary may compete after the fiduciary relationship has ended see aero drapery  swd at  and even has the right to solicit a former employees customers venture express inc v zilly  swd   tenn app  as such insight contends that key did not breach any fiduciary duty because southside did not begin operations until after he was terminated from preferred similarly insight argues that key did not misappropriate any confidential information but rather utilized his own knowledge and skills that he acquired while employed by preferred the business information that preferred contends was confidential included  the repair history of insights vehicles  information regarding the parts used on the vehicles  warranty information on those parts  pricing of the repair work done on insights vehicles and  the inventory necessary to maintain insights fleet insight points out however that much of that information was included on the service invoices provided to insight the record indicates that the invoices typically contained the year make and model of the repaired vehicle the repaired vehicles license number insights unit number and vin number the repaired vehicles mileage the parts installed on the vehicle including the part name number and price the hours spent on labor and the amount charged for labor moreover insight argues that it was certainly entitled to the maintenance and repair information on its own fleet and would certainly have had the right to provide that information to another vendor to whom it used for maintenance insight posits that after termination of the fiduciary relationship key was permitted to carry with him his personal experience enterprise and knowledge to compete with preferred stewart v kentucky paving company inc  swd   ky app  quoting aero drapery  swd  finally insight argues that preferreds claim that key breached his fiduciary duty by hiring preferreds employees is without merit because the evidence was undisputed that key hired mechanics tyler boone and quentin stevens after they were terminated by preferred furthermore insight claims that any hiring prohibition applies only to key employees and preferreds own expert essentially testified that it is common for auto mechanics to frequently change jobs to establish aiding and abetting preferred had to next prove that insight provided key substantial assistance or encouragement in the alleged breach of fiduciary duty preferred alleged that insight helped key by  telling key it would continue to do business with him and  verifying that southside met insights insurance requirements and could handle its fleet maintenance restatement second of torts §  provides that substantial assistance means that a defendants conduct was a substantial factor in causing the tort aetna casualty  surety co v leahey const co  fd   th cir  the comments to §  list factors to consider when determining whether substantial assistance has been provided the nature of the act encouraged the amount of assistance given by the defendant his presence or absence at the time of the tort his relation to the other and his state of mind id citation omitted further substantial assistance means something more than merely providing routine professional services that aid the tortfeasor in remaining in business but do not proximately cause the plaintiffs harm el camino resources ltd v huntington national bank  fsuppd   wd mich  insight argues that its decision to send its vehicles to southside cannot be substantial assistance or encouragement because it was under no contractual obligation to do business with preferred in other words because insight had no contract with preferred its decision to direct business to southside cannot result in liability for loss of that business furthermore insight argues that mathena and knights conversations with key about starting a new business can likewise not be considered substantial assistance because key had no fiduciary duties after january th finally insight points out that verifying that southside met its insurance requirement was done in the routine course of business and cannot support aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty banco industrial de venezuela ca v cdw direct llc  fsuppd   sdny  insight finally claims that there was no evidence presented that it had knowledge that key was a fiduciary or that his conduct may be a breach of his fiduciary duty insight argues that constructive knowledge does not suffice and that preferred had to show that insight actually knew not just that keys conduct breached a fiduciary duty but also that he did not have consent from preferred to seek out other opportunities miles farm supply llc  fd at  insight points out that brian payne in meeting with insight employees on several occasions never informed them that key remained a fiduciary and in fact specifically stated that key had been terminated as of january th therefore insight contends that preferred failed to present any evidence that insight had actual knowledge that  key remained a fiduciary after being terminated  keys competition at southside breached a fiduciary duty  keys use of nonconfidential information about insights own vehicles breach a fiduciary duty or  keys hiring of former preferred employees breached a fiduciary duty thus insight maintains that preferred failed to prove the necessary elements of aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty and that the trial court erred by not granting its motions for a directed verdict or jnov admittedly this is a very close case initially we harbor doubts as to whether key was a fiduciary at the time he allegedly met with mathena and key or when he started southside automotive insight claims that key was terminated on january th while preferred maintains that he only took time off with the intention of returning to work after that date undoubtedly preferreds claim that key remained a director until  is disingenuous at best the record clearly indicates that he had not been listed in any capacity on preferreds corporate reports since  and it was only after litigation commenced that he reappeared as a director nonetheless because there is some question as to whether key remained employed until january th we cannot conclude that there is a complete absence of proof that key was a fiduciary at the time of the alleged tortious conduct further if keys employment did not end until january th and if preferred is given every fair and reasonable inference from the evidence it is not beyond reason that a jury could have found he breached his fiduciary duties to preferred with respect to insights participation in keys alleged breach preferred introduced some evidence that mathena and knight were aware that key continued to have fiduciary obligations to preferred at the time they discussed moving insights business to keysouthside preferred alleged at trial that insight managers received kickbacks from key and that is why they colluded with him to compete against preferred again while the evidence of record that insight aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty is certainly weak we simply cannot find that there was a complete absence of proof on the issue the trial court in ruling on insights motions for a directed verdict and jnov was required to give preferred the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference which could be drawn from the evidence furthermore it is not this courts function to determine the credibility or the weight afforded to the evidence although we do not know the basis for the trial court denying the motions we are compelled to find that there did exist sufficient disputed issues of fact upon which a reasonable jury could have differed so as to preclude a directed verdict or jnov therefore the trial court did not err in denying insights motions jury instructions insight next argues that it is entitled to a new trial because the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on breach of fiduciary duty aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty the proper measure of damages and apportionment of fault it is wellsettled that kentucky follows the bare bones approach to jury instructions in all civil cases olfice inc v wilkey  swd   ky  see also meyers v chapman printing co  swd   ky  however fundamental to that approach is that all of the bones must be presented to the jury correct instructions are absolutely essential to an accurate jury verdict the function of instructions is to tell the jury what it must believe from the evidence in order to resolve each dispositive factual issue in favor of the party who has the burden of proof on that issue see webster v commonwealth  swd  ky  cert denied  us   in light of the importance of correct jury instructions erroneous instructions are presumed prejudicial mckinney v heisel  swd   ky  if it cannot be affirmatively shown that no prejudice resulted from the erroneous instruction reversal is required id insight first challenges the instruction given on the law of fiduciary duty instruction no  provided a fiduciary relationship is founded on the trust and confidence that one person or entity places in another the person in whom trust or confidence is placed is said to have a fiduciary duty this duty includes that he act primarily for the benefit of the other party in matters within the scope of their relationship it was the duty of key to exercise the utmost good faith toward preferred auto while he was an officer director employee andor general manager of preferred auto by acting in preferred autos best interests by disclosing any conflict between his private interests and corporate interests and by not competing with preferred auto or profiting at its expense after termination of keys fiduciary relationship key could not use his prior fiducial information contrary to preferred autos interests nor take with him key personnel to operate a competing enterprise insight contends that the instruction should have stated that key could not use prior fiducial confidences to the detriment of preferred instead the trial court used the term fiducial information which insight maintains is meaningless and could have included any information confidential or otherwise key learned while he was a fiduciary we agree a fiduciary is prohibited from using only confidential information that belongs to a former employer aero drapery  swd at  after the termination of his fiduciary relationship    he may carry with him his personal experience enterprise and knowledge but he may not use prior fiducial confidences id at  emphasis added see also baptist physicians lexington inc v new lexington clinic psc  swd  ky  davis v davis  swd  ky app  stewart v kentucky paving co  swd  ky app  contrary to preferreds position we do not believe that a jury would necessarily interpret fiducial information and fiducial confidences as being one in the same the term fiducial in and of itself is vague and when coupled with information becomes far too broad and meaningless see dsg corp v anderson  fd   th cir  holding that the district court should have provided the jury with any guidance concerning what the term fiducial confidence means we are of the opinion that the instruction did not properly inform the jury that key was only prohibited from using confidential information that belonged to preferred we also agree with insight that instruction no  erroneously instructed the jury that after the termination of keys fiduciary relationship with preferred he could not hire key personnel employed by preferred in fact the law is that he cannot while still a corporate fiduciary set up a competitive enterprise or resign and take with him the key personnel of the corporation for the purpose of operating his own competitive enterprise aero drapery at  emphasis added citations omitted see also baptist physicians lexington inc  swd at  while kentucky law is not extensive it is nonetheless instructive regarding the duties of a corporate director who plans to compete the conduct alleged by nlc misuse of corporate information and recruiting of nlc personnel prior to resignation if proven would support a claim for breach of the physicians common law fiduciary duties emphasis added the wording of the instruction herein essentially stated that key could never hire key personnel of preferred even after his fiduciary duties ceased even accepting as true preferreds dubious argument that its mechanics were key personnel once key was no longer a fiduciary of preferred he was not prohibited from recruiting any of preferreds employees see b  l corp v thomas and thorngren inc  swd   tenn ct app  we therefore find that the trial court properly premised its finding that defendants breached their duties of loyalty to b  l upon defendants wrongful solicitation of employees benson and donnelly prior to their termination or resignation from b  l accordingly we conclude that instruction no  erroneously misstated the law regarding breach of a fiduciary duty insight next argues that the trial courts instruction on aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty was erroneous instruction no  provided as follows instruction no  if you answered yes to interrogatory no  you will now consider whether insight communications is liable for aiding and abetting jerry keys breach of fiduciary duty to find that insight communications aided and abetted jerry key in breaching a fiduciary duty to preferred auto you must determine that a insight knowingly joined with encouraged aided or gave substantial assistance in the actions constituting the breach of fiduciary duty and bpreferred auto suffered damages indeed the aboveinstruction differs significantly from the language of restatement second of torts § b which states for harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of another one is subject to liability if he    b knows that the others conduct constitutes a breach of duty and give substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself the restatement standard clearly requires both  knowledge of the breach of fiduciary duty and  substantial assistance or encouragement to the fiduciary to breach such duty see miles farm supply llc  fd at  the trial courts instruction however combined the requirements and allowed the jury to find for preferred upon a finding that insight knowingly joined assisted or encouraged key contrary to the restatement the jury was not required to specifically find that insight had actual knowledge of keys alleged breach the wording is made all the more erroneous because it only required the jury to find that insight knowingly joined with encouraged or aided key which unquestionably departs from the substantial assistance requirement contained in §  clearly the law requires that the encouragement aid or assistance be substantial id however the instruction herein failed to provide the substantial qualifier to the relevant actions and essentially authorized the jury to find that any encouragement aid or assistance on insights part constituted aiding and abetting consequently we must agree with insight that instruction no  erroneously misstated the law on aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty insight also argues that the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the measure of damages specifically instruction no  provided if you have found for preferred auto and answered yes to interrogatories no  and  then you may award preferred auto such damages as will reasonably compensate it for the losses it has suffered in awarding damages you will exclude from the amount of the award so much of preferred auto damages as you are satisfied from the evidence could have been avoided through the exercise of ordinary care in attempting to continue its business by seeking new customers from the evidence please set forth the amount of money that will compensate preferred auto for insights aiding and abetted sic the breach of fiduciary duty of key insight contends that the trial court was required to instruct the jury that it could only award damages that preferred suffered as a direct result of insights aiding and abetting keys breach in the baptist physicians of lexington inc decision our supreme court stated if nlc establishes a breach of fiduciary duty by any of the physicians or aiding and abetting by baptist the recoverable damages are those caused by the actual breach of those duties not some portion of the revenue stream generated by the physicians through their medical practices after their departure        while quantifying the damages that a corporation incurs when a director improperly uses confidential information or hires corporate employees for a competing venture is not an easy task courts in other jurisdictions have tackled the task see eg b  l corporation v thomas and thorngren inc  swd  tenn app  monotronics corp v baylor  illappd   illdec   ned   when fiduciary duty breaches are proven kentucky trial courts and juries are equally capable of making damage causation determinations on a casebycase basis  swd at  as preferred points out the final sentence of the instruction did instruct the jury to award an amount of money that would compensate preferred for insights tortious conduct nonetheless the prior language in the instruction can also be interpreted as allowing the jury to award such damages as would reasonably compensate preferred for its losses in general including those unrelated to insights alleged tortious conduct that language when coupled by improper expert testimony regarding preferreds lost profits also discussed in this opinion certainly could have resulted in the jury awarding preferred damages for losses that it may have sustained as a result of losing insights business but that were not directly attributable to any tortious conduct insight next argues that instruction no  pertaining to apportionment of fault erroneously omitted southside and johnson insight contends that it introduced sufficient evidence including preferreds complaint against southside and johnson claiming that key misappropriated information belonging to preferred for southsides benefit and preferreds demand letter claiming that key left preferred to work for southside to warrant including southside and johnson in an apportionment instruction pursuant to kentucky revised statutes krs  if there is an active assertion of a claim against joint tortfeasors and the evidence is sufficient to submit the issue of liability to each an apportionment instruction is required whether or not each of the tortfeasors is a partydefendant at the time of trial floyd v carlisle construction co inc  swd   ky  emphasis added see also savage v three rivers medical center  swd   ky  insight suggests that the decision in certainteed corp v dexter  swd  ky  stands for the proposition that a complaint filed against a nonparty is sufficient to submit an apportionment instruction that includes that nonparty party in fact however our supreme court in certainteed held that emptychair defendants who have settled are to be treated no differently than participating defendants in regard to what must be proved to apportion fault against them though the emptychair defendant will not actually be held liable in the trial since it is literally not on trial a participating defendant must still prove liability on the part of the tortfeasor onto whom it seeks to shift some of the blame id at  as stated more explicitly in a case in which the instructions improperly allowed the jury to apportion damages to parties without finding them at fault fault may not be properly allocated to a party a dismissed party or settling nonparty unless the court or the jury first finds that the party was at fault otherwise the party has no fault to allocate    the mere fact that a party has been sued or has settled does not permit the factfinder to allocate part of the total fault to that party owens corning fiberglas corp v parrish  swd   n   ky  citation omitted see also morgan v scott  swd   ky  fault may be apportioned only among those against whom the evidence of liability was sufficient to allow submission of the issue of fault to the jury we are of the opinion that insight failed to meet its burden of proving that southside and johnson knew key owed a fiduciary duty to preferred or that they provided substantial assistance to key in breaching that duty that preferred stated claims against both does not satisfy insights burden of proving their liability so as to shift the blame accordingly the trial court has the authority to deny requested instructions and if there is doubt that the evidence supports the giving of an instruction their decision to do so will only be reversed for an abuse of discretion see olfice inc  swd at  nazar v branham  swd  ky  based on the record before us we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding southside and johnson from the apportionment instruction erronous evidentiary rulings insight first argues that testimony from preferreds damage expert james gravitt should have been excluded under kentucky rules of evidence kre  as it was unreliable and based on assumptions we agree at trial gravitt testified that he was bound by the professional standards of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa gravitt explained that the aicpa practice aid on calculating lost profits requires a link between the wrongful act and the resulting damages gravitt stated that he calculated preferreds damages as being  which represented its lost profits from the time insight ceased doing business with preferred until brian paynes forecasted retirement date in  however during his testimony gravitt acknowledged that he included in his calculations any monies that insight spent at vendors other than preferred and southside including completely unrelated body tire and towing work that preferred had not previously performed for insight when questioned gravitt was unable to identify a causal link between that other work and preferreds damages in fact gravitt conceded that his damages estimate would be greatly reduced if monies representing insights lawful conduct unrelated to the alleged tortious conduct were excluded we must agree with insight that the damage model presented to the jury sought to hold insight liable for damages that had no relationship to the claims asserted by preferred further troubling is the fact that gravitt specifically acknowledged that insight did not have a contract with preferred and was free to move its business to another vendor at any time yet calculated his damages using paynes proposed retirement date of  because it seemed to be a reasonable time period loss of anticipated profits is a recognized form of damages in kentucky if proven with a reasonable certainty paulines chicken villa inc v kfc corp  swd   ky  kentucky utilities co v warren ellison café  ky    swd   ky  although the mere uncertainty as to the amount will not preclude recovery illinois valley asphalt inc v harry berry inc  swd   ky  more than a mere estimate is required further there must be no lack of certainty on account of being too remote conjectural and speculative kentucky utilities co  swd at  preferred has produced no evidence and we find none in the record to indicate that insight would have stayed with preferred after keys departure significantly the parties did not have a contract further there seems to be no dispute that insight and preferreds business was premised upon keys relationship with insight employees thus there is a distinct possibility if not probability that insight would have chosen to maintain its relationship with key and forsaken its business with preferred even absent any alleged wrongful conduct see b  l corp  swd at  baptist physicians lexington inc  swd at  patients    can and do choose from whom they will receive their medical care the patients that have been the subject of much dispute in this case did not belong to nlc and they do not belong to the physicians and baptist a fact that should not be lost on any of the parties on remand gravitts expert testimony that he believed insight would continue to do business with preferred until  was based on nothing more than pure speculation and conjecture consequently his calculation of lost profit damages was unreliable and should have been excluded next insight argues that the trial court erred in allowing a preferred employee barbara hargrove to testify that while he was still employed with preferred key gave her  to obtain two  gift cards from ln credit union so that he could give one of them to bob hargrove stated that she assumed bob was bob mathena of insight insight contends that hargroves testimony was hearsay irrelevant and prejudicial we agree with insight that contrary to preferreds argument the hearsay exception contained in kre  for a declarants state of mind is inapplicable keys state of mind concerning his alleged intent to give mathena a gift card at a point in time well before he was terminated was simply not an issue in the case however we are more troubled by the fact that insight was prohibited from calling an ln representative or introducing a certified business record to establish that the bank had a maximum limit on gift cards of  hargroves testimony was demonstrably false and the trial courts prohibition of any rebuttal evidence proving such was clearly erroneous crossappeal in its crossappeal preferred first argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion to amend its complaint to add claim for a violation of the kentucky uniform trade secrets act kutsa krs  et seq preferred contends that in denying the motion the trial court engaged in an improper and incorrect analysis of the merits of the claim when it ruled that no information identified by preferred constituteed a trade secret as defined by krs  we disagree cr  provides that with exceptions not applicable here a party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires see also nichols v zurich american ins co  swd  ky  in kenney v hanger

to allow an amended pleading and its decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion lambert v franklin real estate co  swd   ky app  krs  the statute wherein kentucky codified the uniform trade secrets act provides in relevant part  trade secret means information including a formula pattern compilation program data device method technique or process that a derives independent economic value actual or potential from not being generally known to and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and b is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy information cannot constitute a trade secret and thus is not confidential if the subject matter is of public knowledge or general knowledge in the industry or if the matter consists of ideas which are well known or easily ascertainable heyerjordan  associates inc v jordan  swd   tenn app  quoting hickory specialties v b  l labs inc  swd   tenn app  we agree with the trial court that there is simply nothing in the record to satisfy the statutory definition of a trade secret in its tendered amended complaint preferred alleged that key acquired and misappropriated certain proprietary and confidential trade secret information belonging to preferred automotive relating to its operations pricing business arrangements suppliers customers parts warranties and vehicle repair histories as we previously concluded however it is questionable whether the information at issue is even confidential much less trade secrets preferred did not derive any independent economic value from its knowledge of insights vehicles preferred profited simply because insight chose to have its fleet maintained by preferred furthermore insight certainly had the right to share with any other vendor it chose for service the repair and maintenance histories as well as the parts and price charged for them in venture express inc v zilly  swd at  the court stated that in the absence of evidence to the contrary this court has held that the following types of information are not confidential  remembered information as to a businesss prices  the specific needs and business habits of certain customers and  an employees personality and the relationships which he has established with certain customers see also b  l corp  swd at  names of customers the prices charged for services rendered the renewal dates for customer contracts and the name of the customer contact person authorized to

ad   pa  material sources and costs are something that would be learned in any productive industry     see also si handling systems inc v heisley  fd  rd cir  we are of the opinion that even if the factual allegations of the amended claim were taken as true preferred would not have been entitled to any relief for a violation of the kutsa because the information it alleges key to have acquired and misappropriated does not satisfy the definition of a trade secret under krs  we conclude that the trial court properly found that it would have been futile for preferred to amend its complaint and as such denied the motion accordingly preferred next argues that the trial court erred by including itself and key in the apportionment instruction specifically preferred contends that apportionment of fault is only permitted among parties in pari delicto and that it cannot share fault in the breach of fiduciary duty since the beneficiary of a fiduciary duty cannot be in pari delicto with the fiduciary who breaches the duty further preferred argues that apportionment to key was improper because insight and key were joint and severally liable pursuant to steelvest inc v scansteel service center  swd   ky  we find both of preferreds arguments to be without merit krs  kentuckys comparative fault statute provides in relevant part  in all tort actions including products liability actions involving fault of more than one  party to the action including thirdparty defendants and persons who have been released under subsection  of this section the court unless otherwise agreed by all parties shall instruct the jury to answer interrogatories or if there is no jury shall make findings indicating a the amount of damages each claimant would be entitled to recover if contributory fault is disregarded and b the percentage of the total fault of all the parties to each claim that is allocated to each claimant defendant thirdparty defendant and person who has been released from liability under subsection  of this section  in determining the percentages of fault the trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the conduct of each party at fault and the extent of the causal relation between the conduct and the damages claimed  the court shall determine the award of damages to each claimant in accordance with the findings subject to any reduction under subsection  of this section and shall determine and state in the judgment each partys equitable share of the obligation to each claimant in accordance with the respective percentages of fault with the adoption of comparative fault the trier of fact is required to consider the conduct of all of the parties including claimants such as preferred and to determine the percentage of total fault of those parties fault has been defined to include an unreasonable failure to avoid an injury or to mitigate damages owens corning fiberglas corp v parrish  swd at  quoting uniform comparative fault act  ula  note  at §b cum supp  preferreds argument that apportionment can only be among parties in pari delicto is misplaced in fact the concept of pari delicto as it is applicable herein refers only to whether a joint tortfeasor is entitled to apportionment or indemnity in degener v hall contracting corp  swd  ky  the kentucky supreme court explained the circumstances in which a defendant has a right to apportion liability and when its right is to indemnity apportionment of liability arises when two or more joint tortfeasors are guilty of concurrent negligence of substantially the same character which converges to cause the plaintiffs damages id at  such joint tortfeasors are said to be in pari delicto id indemnity on the other hand is available to one exposed to liability because of the wrongful act of another with whom heshe is not in pari delicto id at  in either case however whether the joint tortfeasors are or are not in pari delicto has no bearing whether fault can be apportioned to a plaintiff further contrary to preferreds argument liability among joint tortfeasors is no longer joint and several but is several only dix  associates pipeline contractors inc v key  swd  ky  thus because the liability is several as to each joint tortfeasor it is necessary to apportion a specific share of the total liability to each of them whether joined in the original complaint or by thirdparty complaint and the several liability of each joint tortfeasor with respect to the judgment is limited by the extent of hisher fault id at  degener  swd at  preferred erroneously contends that the recent decision in abbott v chesley  swd  ky  supports joint and several liability for breach of fiduciary duty in fact our supreme court specifically recognized that joint and several liability is barred in tort cases by krs  but nevertheless determined that the appellants claim was essentially contractual based upon a breach of the attorneyclient contract and further that the appellees had engaged in a joint enterprise or joint adventure for which joint and several liability is properly assessed pursuant to krs  id at  abbott has no applicability to the instant case based upon the language of krs  and the cases interpreting comparative negligence we conclude that the trial court did not err by instructing the jury to apportion fault to preferred and key both parties have appealed the award of punitive damages insight argues the punitive damages award must be vacated because there was no clear and convincing evidence that it acted with fraud oppression malice or gross negligence krs  williams v wilson  swd  ky  insight further contends that once the trial court ruled that the punitive damage award was the result of passion or prejudice it was required to vacate the award rather than arbitrarily reduce it in its crossappeal however preferred argues that the full punitive damage award should be reinstated because the trial court lacked the authority to reduce it and because the trial court erred in finding that it was the result of passion or prejudice because we are remanding this matter for a new trial however any issues regarding the punitive damages award are necessarily rendered moot for the same reason we decline to address insights arguments pertaining to the closing arguments for the reasons set forth herein the judgment of the jefferson circuit court is reversed and this matter is remanded for a new trial in accordance with this opinion all concur footnotes  curiously in july  shortly after preferred instituted legal action

federal rule of civil procedure b ecf no  plaintiff insight kentucky partners ii lp “insight” responded ecf no  defendants replied ecf no  for the reasons explained below the court will grant in part and deny in part defendants’ motion to dismiss ii allegations in the complaint wireline video providers use facilities placed in public rightsofway to provide video programming to their customers compl ¶  ecf no  these providers run wires and cables including fiber optic wires from central locations to their customers’ businesses and residences id ¶  most of the wires and cables are hung aerially on existing utility poles along the public rightsofway id a insight and the louisville metro council regulations insight is a wireline video provider operating in louisville kentucky id ¶  insight and its predecessor entities have been providing customers in the area with services for decades id ¶  docketsjustiacom  louisville metro council regulates insight as a “cable communications system” id ¶  the regulations placed on insight are apparently costly and concern “extension of service requirements customer service obligations privacy regulations performance measurements interconnection requirements with other similar networks rate regulation requirements regarding street occupancy reporting requirements handling complaints and the requirement to obtain a franchise from louisville metro” id ¶¶   for example the regulations require insight to maintain a repair and maintenance service that is capable of responding to customer complaints or requests within twentyfour hours and to provide louisville metro council with the results of system performance measurement tests id ¶  insight must also maintain service logs and follow a preventive maintenance program id regarding the franchise requirement insight has operated under a franchise agreement with louisville metro council since may   id ¶  in  the franchise agreement expired id insight initiated timely renewal negotiations under the federal cable act id in  and  insight entered into settlement agreements with louisville metro council id ¶  n these agreements confirmed that the  franchise agreement was still in effect id b att and the louisville metro council regulations bellsouth telecommunications llc att is another wireline video provider operating in louisville id ¶  unlike with insight louisville metro council does not regulate att as a “cable communications system” id ¶  according to insight att takes the position that it operates under a historic stateissued telecommunications franchise and does not require a separate video franchise to operate in louisville id thus att apparently is not subject to the regulations placed on insight nor is it required to obtain a franchise from louisville metro council id  c google and the louisville metro council regulations google fiber kentucky llc “google” has applied for and been granted authority by louisville metro council to become a wireline video provider in the city and surrounding area and plans to construct its own wireline video network id ¶  when google has finished constructing its wireline video network it will compete with att and insight in providing video services to customers in louisville id ¶¶ – unlike with insight louisville metro council does not plan to regulate google as a “cable communications system” id ¶  instead louisville metro council will treat google as a “communications service” provider and will subject it to minimal regulations id in february  louisville metro council approved an “interlocal cooperation agreement” with the jefferson county kentucky municipalities that possess franchise authority id ¶  the agreement authorizes louisville metro council to advertise and process bids for a single standard franchise agreement for communication infrastructure service providers seeking to serve the louisville metro area and municipalities in jefferson county a “uniform franchise” id in june  louisville metro council awarded google a uniform franchise id ¶  the uniform franchise requires google to comply with applicable requirements in the louisville metro public works  assets utility policy and with louisville metro council’s permitting and inspection requirements related to working in the public rightofway id ¶  the uniform franchise also requires google to pay a “communications franchise fee” in an amount not to exceed  if state law were changed to permit such a fee id overall insight asserts that the uniform franchise agreement and the louisville metro code regulations placed on  google will be less burdensome than those that louisville metro council has placed on it id ¶  d insight’s request to decrease regulations and the louisville metro council’s adoption of the onetouch ordinance in june  insight sent louisville metro council a letter seeking regulatory treatment similar to the regulations that it will apparently place on google id ¶  in july  after louisville metro had awarded google a uniform franchise insight sent another letter that again sought regulatory treatment similar to the regulations that will be placed on google id ¶  in august  louisville metro council declined insight’s requests id ¶  a few months before insight sought similar regulatory treatment in february  louisville metro council adopted the onetouch ordinance id ¶  the onetouch ordinance allows a communications service provider seeking to make a new utility pole attachment to relocate or alter the attachments or facilities of any preexisting thirdparty user to accommodate its own approved attachments id ¶  the communications service provider must use the owner of the utility pole’s approved contractors id the onetouch ordinance does not require the communications service provider to notify the preexisting thirdparty of its intent to relocate or alter the attachments unless the relocation or alteration would cause a customer outage id ¶  if the communications service provider has not provided advance notice of its intent to relocate or alter an attachment it must notify the preexisting thirdparty about any relocation or alteration within  days after performing the work id ¶  the preexisting thirdparty then has  days to inspect the work to make any claim of damages or other complaints id e insight’s claims against defendants in september  insight filed suit against defendants compl  ecf no  insight asserts six claims first insight claims under  usc §  that defendants’ preferential  treatment of att and google infringed on its ability to engage in and transmit speech which violated the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution and section  of the kentucky constitution count i id ¶¶ – second insight asserts under  usc §  that defendants’ preferential treatment of att and google denied it equal protection of the law which violated the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution and section  of the kentucky constitution count ii id ¶¶ – third insight asserts that kentucky law granting the public service commission exclusive authority to regulate utility pole attachments preempts louisville’s onetouch ordinance count iii id ¶¶ – fourth insight claims under  usc §  that the onetouch ordinance constitutes an unlawful taking of its property which violates the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution and section  of the kentucky constitution count iv id ¶¶ – fifth insight also seeks declaratory relief and an award of attorney fees under  usc §§  and  to remedy the alleged constitutional violations count v id ¶¶ – sixth insight seeks a declaratory judgment under  usc §§  and  to determine the respective rights of the parties count vi id ¶¶ – iii discussion defendants now move to dismiss counts i through v under federal rule of civil procedure b rule b provides that a party may move to dismiss a cause of action for “failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted” to survive a motion to dismiss a complaint must contain sufficient facts to state a claim that is “plausible on its face” bell atl corp v twombly  us    a complaint states a plausible claim for relief when  defendants do not address count vi they note however in their memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss that “counts v and vi of the complaint merely repeat the allegations of the first four counts and seek attorneys’ fees under  usc §  and declaratory relief under  usc §§  and ” mem supp mot dismiss  ecf no   the court may “draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged” ashcroft v iqbal  us    a court is not required to accept legal conclusions or “threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action” id when resolving a motion to dismiss the court must “construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff accept its allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff” wesley v campbell  fd   th cir  quoting directv inc v treesch  fd   th cir  defendants argue that the court should dismiss counts i and ii because insight waived its right to assert violations of the right to free speech and equal protection when it entered into settlement agreements with louisville metro council in  and  and because any claim based on comparisons to louisville metro council’s treatment of google is not yet ripe mem supp mot dismiss – ecf no  defendants argue that count iii should be dismissed because louisville’s onetouch ordinance is not preempted by kentucky law id at – defendants maintain that the court should dismiss count iv because louisville metro council’s onetouch ordinance does not constitute an unlawful taking of property id at – defendants finally argue that count v should be dismissed because the declaratory relief is unavailable for reasons found in their arguments related to counts i ii and iv and because  usc § a bars insight’s request for attorney fees as a matter of law id at – a whether counts i and ii should be dismissed as noted above insights asserts in count i that defendants’ preferential treatment of att and google infringed on its free speech rights under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution and section  of the kentucky constitution compl ¶¶ – ecf no  insight also contends in count ii that this preferential treatment  denied it equal protection of the law which violated the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution and section  of the kentucky constitution id ¶¶ – defendants argue that the court should dismiss count i and count ii because insight waived its free speech and equal protection rights and because to the extent that the claims are based on comparisons to louisville metro’s treatment of google they are not yet ripe mem supp mot dismiss –  n ecf no  i whether insight waived its free speech and equal protection rights an initial matter regarding defendants’ waiver argument that this court must address is whether waiver may be asserted in a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b insight contends that waiver is an affirmative defense and thus is improperly asserted on a rule b motion to dismiss resp opp mot dismiss – ecf no  defendants reply that the “sixth circuit has repeatedly held a motion to dismiss may be granted on the basis of a conclusively established affirmative defense” reply – ecf no  waiver is an affirmative defense see fed r civ p c listing affirmative defenses a motion to dismiss may be granted based on an affirmative defense when “the facts conclusively establish the defense as a matter of law” grant konvalinka  harrison pc v banks in re mckenzie  fd   th cir  citing hensley mfg v propride inc  fd   th cir  thus defendants may properly assert waiver in their motion to dismiss turning to the merits of defendants’ waiver argument defendants explain that insight was aware of their allegedly more favorable treatment of att when entering into settlement agreements with louisville metro council in  and  therefore defendants maintain insight waived any freedom of speech or equal protection claims that allegedly arise out of their  unequal treatment of att mem supp mot dismiss – ecf no  defendants further assert that insight waived its free speech and equal protection rights by accepting the application of the  franchise agreement and louisville metro code in the  and  settlement agreements id at – the  franchise agreement included provisions acknowledging that insight was subject to local law including §  of the louisville metro code id this portion of the louisville metro code provides that a franchisee will not challenge a franchise as “unreasonable arbitrary voidable or void” id insight argues in opposition that it never waived its right to assert a freedom of speech or equal protection claim resp opp mot dismiss – ecf no  insight notes that the settlement agreements with louisville metro council from  and  expressly provide that it does not waive any rights held under applicable law id at  insight also clarifies that it is not challenging the franchise as “unreasonable arbitrary voidable or void” and thus §  of the louisville metro code does not apply to this case id at  and regardless insight did not waive any constitutional rights in agreeing to abide by §  of the louisville metro code id at  constitutional rights may be contractually waived when “the facts and circumstances surrounding the waiver make it clear that the party foregoing its rights has done so of its own volition with full understanding of the consequences of its waiver” henley v cuyahoga cty bd of mental retardation  developmental disabilities  f app’x   th cir  citing erie telecomms inc v city of erie  fd   d cir  waiver must be “voluntary knowing and intelligent” depending on the “particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case including the background experience and conduct of the waiving party”  erie telecomms  fd at  internal citations omitted waiver must be established by “clear and compelling evidence” id internal citations omitted the supreme court analyzed the contractual waiver of a constitutional right in dh overmyer co v frick co  us   and in fuentes v shevin  us   in dh overmyer the defendant contracted with the plaintiff to have a refrigeration system placed in a warehouse  us at  the defendant fell behind on its payments for the refrigeration system id the defendant negotiated with the plaintiff regarding the delayed payments id at  it eventually executed a note containing a judgment clause that waived service of process and allowed the plaintiff to confess a judgment against it id at – when the defendant still failed to pay for the refrigeration system the plaintiff’s attorney filed suit against the defendant and caused judgment to be entered against the defendant under the note id at  the defendant appealed asserting in relevant part that the judgment and the note violated its constitutional right to due process id at  the supreme court emphasized that due process rights are waivable and held that the defendant had knowingly voluntarily and intelligently waived its constitutional right to due process when it agreed to the confession of judgment clause id at – in fuentes the plaintiff purchased a stove and stereo from the defendant under an installment contract  us at  the plaintiff retained title to the merchandise but she was only entitled to possession if she timely paid the installment contract id when she had paid all but  of the installment contract the defendant filed suit in a smallclaims court for repossession of the stove and stereo id the clerk of the small claims court issued a writ of replevin and a local deputy sheriff and one of the defendant’s agents went to the plaintiff’s home and seized the stereo and stove id at  the plaintiff then sued the defendant and challenged  the state’s replevin procedures under the fourteenth amendment due process clause id on appeal the supreme court addressed whether the plaintiff’s signing of a conditional sales contract that provided that the defendant could take the merchandise if payment was defaulted waived her constitutional right to due process id at  the court found that the parties had not bargained over contractual terms and that the language of the contract was “no more than a statement of the seller’s right to repossession upon occurrence of certain events” id at – thus the court held that the contract did not waive the plaintiff’s right to due process taking all reasonable inferences in favor of insight defendants have not established that insight’s purported knowledge of att’s allegedly more favorable contract with louisville metro council constituted a knowing voluntary and intelligent waiver of its constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection further challenging defendants’ waiver argument is that neither the parties’  settlement agreement nor their  settlement agreement includes a waiver of insight’s freedom of speech and equal protection constitutional rights see  settlement agreement ecf no   settlement agreement ecf no  moreover the  settlement agreement states “nothing herein shall constitute a waiver of any rights held by insight or louisville metro council under applicable law”  settlement agreement  ecf no  the  settlement agreement likewise provides “nothing herein shall constitute an amendment or modification of the franchise or a waiver of any rights held by franchisee or louisville metro council under applicable law”  settlement agreement  ecf no  section  of the louisville metro code similarly fails to support defendants’ waiver argument insight’s  franchise agreement under which insight continues to operate as agreed in the  and  settlement agreements states that insight will abide by the cable  act and “any other applicable provisions of federal state and local law” franchise agreement  ecf no  section  of the louisville metro code states by acceptance of any franchise hereunder a franchisee covenants and agrees that it will not at any time or in any manner or proceeding set up any term or condition of this chapter or of any ordinance or agreement awarding a franchise hereunder as unreasonable arbitrary voidable or void or that the metro government had not the power or authority to make such term or condition but shall be required to accept the validity of same in their entirety counts i and ii do not challenge the  franchise agreement as “unreasonable arbitrary voidable or void” instead the claims challenge louisville metro’s allegedly unequal treatment of insight as compared to att and google see compl ¶¶ – ecf no  and §  appears not to waive insight’s right to assert constitutional claims against louisville metro council for violations of its constitutional rights in sum defendants’ argument that counts i and ii should be dismissed because insight waived its right to assert freedom of speech and equal protection claims is unavailing ii whether insight’s claims based on comparisons to louisville metro’s treatment of google are ripe defendants explain that because insight has not specifically alleged that google accepted the offered uniform franchise agreement deployed any facilities in louisville’s rightofway or offered any competing services to customers in louisville insight cannot yet show any freedom of speech or equal protection injury as related to google mem supp mot dismiss  n ecf no  insight contends in opposition that defendants’ ripeness argument is not properly addressed in a motion to dismiss and regardless it “challenges defendants’ decision not to treat it substantially similar to google that claim is ripe for review now” resp opp mot dismiss  ecf no   under the doctrine of ripeness “federal judicial power is to be exercised    only at the instance of who is himself immediately harmed or immediately threatened with harm by the challenged action” poe v ullman  us    a plaintiff however need not “await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief” blum v yaretsky  us    quoting penn v wv  us    “the question becomes whether any perceived threat to respondents is sufficiently real and immediate to show an existing controversy” id citing oshea v littleton  us    here given the allegations in the complaint the constitutional claims asserted in counts i and ii are ripe for review according to the complaint louisville metro has already declined to place insight under the same regulatory scheme as google thereby leading to insight’s constitutional claims see eg compl ¶  ecf no  explaining that louisville metro wrote insight a letter declining insight’s requests to be treated under the same regulatory scheme as google furthermore the perceived threat to insight arising from defendants’ different regulatory treatment is sufficiently real and immediate insight does not need to wait until google completes its wireline network to bring its constitutional claims thus defendants’ argument that insight’s constitutional claims involving google are not ripe is unavailing b whether count iii should be dismissed count iii asserts that kentucky law granting the state’s public service commission exclusive authority to regulate utility pole attachments preempts louisville’s onetouch ordinance id ¶¶ – the relevant state law kentucky revised statute §  provides the onetouch ordinance provides “upon approval of an attachment application attacher may relocate or alter the attachments or facilities of any preexisting third party user as may be necessary to accommodate its attachment” ordinance no  at  ecf no  insight   the commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of rates and service of utilities but with that exception nothing in this chapter is intended to limit or restrict the police jurisdiction contract rights or powers of cities or political subdivisions ky rev stat ann §  the parties’ dispute concerning count iii’s dismissal centers on whether louisville metro’s onetouch ordinance concerns the “regulation of    services of utilities” as set out in kentucky revised statute §  or falls within the municipality’s general police power defendants argue that the onetouch ordinance “falls within louisville metro’s police power to manage its rightsofway and therefore falls outside of the exclusive jurisdiction of the public service commission” mem supp mot dismiss – ecf no  insight argues in opposition that the onetouch ordinance concerns the movement and relocation of utility pole attachments which the public service commission regulates as a service of a utility resp opp mot dismiss – ecf no  kentucky revised statute §  defines “service” of a utility as any practice or requirement in any way relating to the service of any utility including the voltage of electricity the heat units and pressure of gas the purity pressure and quantity of water and in general the quality quantity and pressure of any commodity or product used or to be used for or in connection with the business of any utility but does not include voice over internet protocol voip service alleges that the onetouch ordinance was “designed to reduce google’s costs of constructing its network and speed time to market for delivery of its services to the subscribing public” compl ¶  ecf no   in support of their motion to dismiss count iii defendants cite to materials that are not referenced in insight’s claims see eg mem supp mot dismiss  n– ecf no  id at  n providing background information about the development of the onetouch ordinance as these materials are not cited in the complaint and are not central to insight’s claims the court did not consider them in ruling on defendants’ motion to dismiss see bassett v ncaa  fd   th cir  “when a court is presented with a rule b motion it may consider the complaint and any exhibits attached thereto public records items appearing in the record of the case and exhibits attached to defendants motion to dismiss so long as they are referred to in the complaint and are central to the claims contained therein”  kentucky case law interpreting the definition of a “service” in the context of kentucky revised statute §  is limited one applicable case is benzinger v union light heat  power  ky   ky  in benzinger the city of covington enacted an ordinance requiring utility companies to place their wires underground and to remove all utility poles from the streets id at  an electric company filed suit against covington alleging that the ordinance to place wires underground infringed on the public service commission’s exclusive jurisdiction over the service of utilities id at – the kentucky court of appeals determined that the legislature’s use of the word “service” was intended to apply only to the “quality” and “quantity” of utility products thus because covington’s underground wire ordinance did not concern the quality or quantity of electric services it did not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the public service commission and instead was enacted under the municipality’s general police power id at  kentucky catv association v volz is another more recent kentucky case relevant to determining the definition of “service” in the context of kentucky revised statute §   swd  ky ct app  in volz the public service commission determined that it had jurisdiction to regulate utility pole attachment agreements between cable television operators and utility companies id at  plaintiffs a collection of several cable companies appealed the decision and argued that the public service commission did not have authority to regulate contracts between private television operators and utility companies id the kentucky court of appeals noted that a utility pole is “an essential part of the facilities of most regulated utilities” id at  the appellate court then explained that in allowing cable television operators to attach their cables to unused space on a utility pole the utilities were providing a “service” as defined by kentucky revised statute §  id at  the court noted that the definition of a  “service” is broad it “not only includes the basic services for which a utility is created but is also includes any service which arises from the use of a utility’s facilities such as its poles” id therefore the court determined that services generated by utility pole attachment agreements fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the public service commission id given the kentucky court of appeal’s decision in volz the definition of “service” as used in kentucky revised statute §  is broad the activity of moving utility pole attachments which the onetouch ordinance purports to regulate plausibly falls within this definition therefore defendants’ argument that the onetouch ordinance is not preempted by kentucky law fails and the court will deny their motion to dismiss count iii c whether count iv should be dismissed count iv alleges that louisville metro’s onetouch ordinance is an unlawful taking of property in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution and section  of the constitution compl ¶¶ – ecf no  defendants first contend that count iv should be dismissed because insight has no property interest in a particular location on a utility pole mem supp mot dismiss – ecf no  insight maintains that it has identified a legally cognizable property right in the operation and maintenance of its existing cable network resp opp mot dismiss  ecf no  property rights in a “physical thing have been described as the rights ‘to possess use and dispose of it’” loretto v teleprompter manhattan catv corp  us    citing united states v general motors corp  us    in this case insight alleges a property interest greater than the right to a particular location on a utility pole instead it has alleged that it has “a “vested property interest in its physical network in louisville including its  the takings clause of the fifth amendment and section  of the kentucky constitution prohibit the government from taking private property for public use without just compensation  wires equipment and other facilities attached to utility poles in louisville” compl ¶  ecf no  given this allegation defendants have not met their burden of showing that insight failed to identify in its complaint a cognizable property interest defendants secondly argue that count iv should be dismissed because any touching of its wires that may be authorized by louisville’s onetouch regulation is temporary and does not deprive insight of any beneficial use of its facilities mem supp mot dismiss – ecf no  insight argues however that defendants’ argument turns on a fact issue and thus is inappropriate for resolution on a rule  motion and that it properly alleges a takings claim resp opp mot dismiss – ecf no  whether a government action is a taking is fact dependent ark game  fish commn v united states  s ct    a regulatory taking occurs when a government regulation “‘goes too far’ in restricting a property owner’s use of their property” tenn scrap recyclers assn v bredesen  fd   th cir  when the regulation does not render the property valueless a court uses a balancing test found in penn central transportation co v city of new york  us   id the balancing test requires the court to look at “the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant” “the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investmentbacked expectations” and “the character of the governmental action” to determine whether a regulatory taking has occurred penn central transp co  us at  here taking all reasonable inferences in favor of insight insight has sufficiently pleaded that the onetouch ordinance constitutes a regulatory taking insight asserts that the onetouch ordinance “constitutes an unlawful taking of its property by the state action of a municipal ordinance that allows a competitor repeatedly to trespass upon take possession of move and  potentially damage its facilities for a private use” compl ¶  ecf no  insight also claims that the onetouch ordinance allows google “to repeatedly handle move interfere with and potentially damage its wires equipment and other facilities attached to utility poles in the rightofway which threatens to destroy insight’s investment in and ability to use its facilities to provide service for its customers” id ¶  these allegations plausibly suggest that the onetouch ordinance could have severe economic impacts on insight could disrupt its investmentbacked expectations and would be an intrusive government action as such defendants’ argument that count iv should be dismissed because of the temporary effect of the onetouch ordinance fails at this time d whether count v should be dismissed count v seeks declaratory relief and an award of attorney fees under  usc §§  and  to remedy the alleged constitutional violations compl ¶¶ – ecf no  defendants first argue that insight’s request for declaratory relief in count v should be dismissed for “the reasons set forth” in their discussion of counts i ii and iv mem supp mot dismiss  ecf no  insight asserts that it has alleged cognizable constitutional claims and thus defendants’ motion to dismiss its request for declaratory relief should be denied resp opp mot dismiss  ecf no  as explained above insight has plausibly pled its claims alleging violations of its constitutional rights the court will accordingly deny defendants’ motion to dismiss count v to the extent that insight seeks declaratory relief defendants also maintain that insight’s request for attorney fees under  usc §  in count v should be dismissed because it is barred by  usc § a id at – insight asserts that it has alleged cognizable constitutional claims and that its claims are not barred by §  a which limits the relief a cable operator can obtain for a “claim” not a “proceeding” resp opp mot dismiss  ecf no  section aa provides in any court proceeding    involving any claim against a franchising authority or other governmental entity    arising from the regulation of cable service or from a decision of approval or disapproval with respect to a grant renewal transfer or amendment of a franchise any relief to the extent such relief is required by any other provision of federal state or local law shall be limited to injunctive relief and declaratory relief this court proceeding involves constitutional claims—counts i ii and iv—that are asserted against a franchising authority and that arise from the regulation of a cable service therefore the relief in this case is limited to injunctive relief and declaratory relief insight’s claim for attorney fees based on the alleged constitutional injuries is barred by § a the court will dismiss count v to the extent it seeks attorney fees for failure to state a claim as a matter of law v conclusion the court will grant in part and deny in part defendants’ motion to dismiss the court will grant defendants’ motion to dismiss regarding count v to the extent that it seeks attorney fees the court will deny defendants’ motion to dismiss regarding counts i ii iii iv and v to the extent that it seeks declaratory relief because defendants appear not to have addressed count vi in their motion to dismiss memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss or reply this claim remains pending an order will be entered in
