idea of what the building and exhibits will look like  we will be able to answer questions in greater detail and will have visuals that express the mission of the new museum to potential donors last spring the museum foundation reached out to leading architect and museum planning and design firms across the country  virtually all of them –  architectural firms and  exhibit design firms  expressed
