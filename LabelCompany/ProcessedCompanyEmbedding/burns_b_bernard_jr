attention to detail and his willingness to answer any and all questions via phone or email during my dealings with him he responded to my myriad of questions usually within an hour or two exceptional for any attorney his office staff is courterious and professional he is serious and diligent in handling cases although the da would not budge for any type of reduced sentence i feel he did the best he could under the circumstances the outcome of the case was not entirely favorable to me as i had two bad options to decide upon looking back i would have explained the details of what happened differently i feel like i blabbered on too much by disclosing to him some personally damaging information thereby not giving him many options to deny what my ex reported to the police he is a very scrupulous person again not a common trait for attorneys being totally honest with him was not in my best interest and feel things would have gone differently had he argued and questioned the validity and proof of my exwifes accusations more fervently it was my word against hers and sadly the judges do tend to lean more to the wifes side of the storyeven without any proof the fact that i had been punched scatched and kicked by my ex several times during our marriage were never even brought before the judge thankfully she and i have developed a decent rapport as the years went by just be cautious and prudent in what you disclose to him that could negatively affect your case but i can tell you that things could have turned out much worse without his representation as he is a well known and respected attorney in the charlotte area the da would not allow us any options for a lesser charge and she was unwilling to compromise in my case the sentencing resulted in a reduction to a pjc but even this created many personal and professional difficulties eg being refused employment on one occasion due to a background check hes a great guy and will work hard for you but in the end its the judges and the das who ultimately call the shots i would still recommend him he is honest and he takes all his cases very seriously the  stars is simply because he was unable to have the case dismissed or at least reduced to a lesser offense which is obviously what people are looking for when they retain counsel he did manage to attain a pjc for the final disposition and i remain grateful for his efforts in doing solaw office of christopher a connellymikemiller ratedthere is no strong lawyer in all of the charlotte area than attorney chris connelly if you are trying to find the best lawyer possible to help you with a case and at a very reasonable price look no further after getting my nd dui in  years i was scared to death and determined to find the best lawyer that i can find to represent me i went in person to interview several lawyers to determine who i felt would have the experience and knowledge to best find a way to get me out of this mess the moment i went to see chris connelly i immediately knew he was good my case got continued several times before going to trial and every time mr connelly entered the courtroom you could see the level of respect other attorneys gave him because it was very clear that he was the real deal chris connelly put in countless hours of study into my personal case to gather all the facts and presented many different and creative strategies in which we could attack our case because of his high level of expertise it almost seemed as if no one was brave enough to stand up against him as a result the state kept asking for continuences totaling nearly two years finally when the day of judgement finally came the trial took nearly no time at all and the judge made the ruling to dismiss the case i was astonished to see how quickly chris connelly won our case for us if you are looking for the best lawyer money can buy rest assured that chris connelly is the best if you are unsure if you can afford such a highly skilled lawyer you would be surprised at how reasonable his rates are if you care about your future like i did hiring attorney chris connelly will be the best decision you can makelaw office of christopher a connellychriscat ratedchris has done it again rd time is charm the first time i used chris he got me off of reckless driving and speeding i contacted him on friday evening and got a email back from him saturday monday morning he called me at like am and informed me the charges were droppednd  incident  caught on hwy  doing mph in my corvette again charges droppedrd screw up and definitely my last i ran from the police on my street bike charged with felony eluding confiscated my bike mph failure to stop and about  other tickets i spent the night in jail and as soon as i got out i contacted chriss office within an hour he called me back and said to come in and talk from there on i didnt have to do anything but show up at court anytime i had a question and emailed chris i had a response within a couple of hours in court the man is awesome he got in front of the judge and made me sound like a medal of honor war hero im a veteran i guess it helped because when it was all said and done my felony was reduced to a misdemeanor speeding was dropped and the only thing i got was reckless driving which is very fair considering i was passing state troopers well over mph inches from their mirrors one occasion i went through two of them so i totally deserve a reckless driving charge last but certainly not least i got my bike back woohooo i cant drive it for a year but thats probably for the best thanks again chris heres another  for this reviewlaw office of christopher a connellyscott c ratedi applied for my ccw permit in june of  i was notified in october of that same year that my permit was denied due to some information shared by my medical provider first the sheriff took more time than what is legally allowed to review my permit second and more importantly i was wrongfully and subjectively categorized as being ineligible to have a ccw permit based on north carolinas mental health law i contacted chris connelly and explained to him my case i could see during our introductory meeting that he was very passionate about defending me as he had heard far too many other cases of honest hardworking lawabiding citizens being denied their second amendment rights based on the subjective thinking of mecklenburg countys liberal activist sheriffi followed chriss instructions to the letter providing him all necessary documentation and referral letters in a timely manner by march of  i was notified that chris had won our appeal and my legal right to possess a ccw was upheldi cannot thank chris connelly enough and would highly recommend anyone faced with a similar case to contact him immediately do not take this challenge on alone you only have one chance at a ccw appeal make it count hire chris connellylaw office of stephen m corbykenneth ratedif you are looking for lawyer please take the time to at least read what i have to say about this incredible lawyer i am almost  years old have hired many attorneys but not one that does this great of a job he listens to what you have to say has a courtroom demeanor that makes you feel like you are being protected and defended in the best possible manner his fees are fair and welldeserved he reviews all aspects and studies your case like it is the only one although he has very many others he is extremely intelligent and knows the law and when to apply it spontaneously and correctly you can trust what he says and what he does he keeps his word if you google this attorney you will find the complete experience that i had with mr corby it is worth the time to review it appears that mr corby has saved me about  in alleged estate debt do you know anyone else that can do that this attorney is both great to work with and a wonderful person he is not arrogant and condescending but caring and attentive hire him quick before your opposition does once you hire him you will understand why i said thatlaw office of christopher a connellyadam w ratedi highly recommend mr connelli highly recommend mr connelly i was charged with a dui a couple years ago and hired a different law firm the case was continued for almost a year which was fine by me but every time i appeared for court there was a different attorney from the firm to whom i had to explain the details of my case i understand that i am not a high profile politician or celebrity but i felt as if they could not have cared less about my situation about a year later i was pulled over and arrested for dwlr and decided to hire mr connelly based on a few recommendations from others who had similar situations when you hire chris you will deal with chris i much prefer this approach and felt as if he gave a damn about me and my situation this was a pretty serious situation considering the dwlr was a result of a dui charge and jail time was a real possibility ultimately mr connelly was able to get the charge completely dismissed this could have had a major impact on my career especially if it resulted in any jail time and i could not be more appreciative of the job that mr connelly didlaw office of christopher a connellytait a ratedrecent international tragedies and violent crimes prompted me to seek a handgun permit that would allow me to take responsibility for my family’s protection so when my permit request was denied i was dismayed and didn’t know what to do fortunately i was referred to christopher connelly an attorney who fervently believes in and was willing to fight for my nd amendment rights mr connelly and his entire staff were professionals in every sense of the word christopher’s counsel was excellent his approach was personable professional and legally sound within a few months my permit was approved and my rights were restoredi firmly believe christopher connelly is the greatest and most qualified nd amendment attorney in charlotte nc i assure you he is on your side and will do everything in his power to receive a judgment in your favor i recommend him in the highest regard and i’m forever
