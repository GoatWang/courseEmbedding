f symbol fibfx summary overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high low this funds expenses are rated as low because they are below the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds

has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics

default and changes in government intervention these factors may also lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked investments unlike traditional debt investments are also subject to prepayment risk which means that they may increase in value less than other bonds when interest rates decline and decline in value more than other bonds when interest rates rise bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments default risk is generally higher for nonqualified mortgages interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds unlike bonds funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses the use of derivatives may increase these risks by increasing investment exposure which may be considered leverage or in the case of overthecounter instruments because

display at page download multi asset credit reviewing your credit exposure is it time to consider a multiasset approach error download document jason wood  years ago views transcription  it seems that whoever you talk to in the pensions industry about their current hot topic the answer is multiasset credit mac but what does this term really mean the answer it appears depends who you ask when you also consider absolute return bond arb funds which are often talked about in the same breath the potential for confusion is rife the purpose of this newsletter is firstly to consider the role that credit typically plays within a portfolio we then compare this to the types of asset macarb funds hold before considering the strategic and tactical case for such funds what role does credit play within a pension scheme portfolio whilst bonds will act as a diversifying asset in a typical portfolio for a defined benefit pension scheme a credit portfolio will tend to be heavily focused towards sterling denominated investment grade credit to understand why this is we need to consider the dual role that credit typically plays within a portfolio however the sterling investment grade market is a small component of the global bond market its current market cap is bn compared to the global investment grade bond market of tn with a further tn in high yield and emerging markets does this historic focus solely on one part of the market remain justified let s start by considering the current state of the broad credit market   to provide some interest rate protection and thereby provide a level of matching to the funding assumptions an asset that has exposure to movements in mid and longdated interest rates ie gilt yields to provide some excess returns over and above that available on gilts again this is often required within an actuary s funding model given the sterling investment grade market has the closest link to sterling denominated liabilities with a slightly longer duration than the global bond market it is easy to see why pension schemes focus has been on this part of the market macarb investing aims to open up the available universe of credit investments the approach involves gaining exposure to a wide variety of areas of the credit market both by geography and instrument selection at the same time the approach involves removing or significantly reducing the interest rate exposure associated with a traditional bond investment approach the approach involves active management and should not be managed against a market benchmark but against a measure of cash returns  of  how is the credit market currently positioned multiasset credit yields example asset categories it almost doesn t matter which part of the credit market you are considering yields are close to record lows in absolute terms and the spread the additional yield on credit over government bonds  source bank of america merrill lynch credit suisse iboxx western european loans global high yield is closing in on precrisis lows the charts to the right set out the absolute yields in the top chart and the spread in the bottom chart us high yield global emerging markets sterling nongilts if we take us high yield bonds as an example the current annual yield is  compared to an  average yield over the past  years of  the spread is currently  compared to an average spread of  over the past  years a similar story is true in investment grade credit where the spread has fallen to around  whilst  this remains above precrises lows of around  there has been a significant change in the composition of that index over the period comparing the current index to that precrisis we see a significant increase in the proportion of the benchmark rated a and bbb the ratings on aaa aa securities are around their precrisis lows for example aa rated debt has a current spread of  compared to  in june trustees should consider the impact of the change in composition of the benchmark index on their credit allocation   multiasset credit spreads example asset categories western european loans source bank of america merrill lynch credit suisse iboxx global high yield us high yield global emerging markets sterling nongilts  of  are historically low spreads justified to an extent yes the level of defaults remain low compared to historical standards and corporates in general have low levels of leverage and large cash amounts clearly risks remain if growth does not follow through andor interest rates rise the servicing of this debt may become more problematic this brings us onto the second area to be concerned about and that is liquidity liquidity is one of those wonderful things that tends to be there until the point at which you need it the corporate bond market is fundamentally less liquid than it used to be due to new capital requirements banks are far less likely to supply liquidity to the bond market than before the crisis schemes therefore need to be very comfortable in the quality of the credit they hold as they may not be able to sell it in the event of another crisis one of the key rationales for mac investing is to fully open up the availability of the credit markets and as well as those subsets listed above also potentially allow for investments in subinvestment grade bonds high yield cash emerging market bonds both corporate and government both local and hard currency typically us dollar floating rate bonds secured and unsecured lending loans convertible and hybrid bonds what assets might a multiasset credit fund invest in as mentioned above the sterling investment grade market is a small subset of the entire credit market a scheme invested in this part of the market may expect to hold traditional investment grade corporate bonds in fact the benchmark index will also include supranational bonds government bonds sterling denominated emerging market bonds asset backed securities some hybrid bonds  of  trustees could make a strategic allocation to any part of the credit market for example a separate allocation to local currency em bonds high yield bonds etc however this has significant governance implications and therefore what mac funds potentially offer is all of this under one roof and the ability to delegate to the manager the choice of which part of the global credit market to invest in     ratings allocation of three example funds cash nr ccc b is this potential realised in the chart to the right we set out the asset allocation of three funds that fall under the mac banner we see that there is indeed a wider range of asset classes being invested in however we also see a significant difference in the asset allocation whether we consider that by broad asset class or by credit rating     bb bbb a aa aaa what we can quickly conclude is that different managers will have different areas of expertise and therefore have different ways of managing a mac fund it is worth noting that there are certain sectors of the credit market that mac funds tend not to invest in these are the less liquid parts of  a b c source investment managers the market and include private debt including mezzanine financing asset class allocation of three example funds infrastructure and real estate debt direct lending    emerging markets abs ig credit  loans  high yield  government  cash   a b c source investment managers  of  what s the difference with an absolute return bond arb fund arb funds are often mentioned in the same breath as mac funds the term absolute shouldn t be taken literally these funds can and will fall in value in certain market conditions whilst arb funds will tend to invest in similar types of asset to a mac fund there are significant differences one of the key differences in an arb fund is the ability to short benefit from a fall in price the market or certain investments mac funds tend to be long only there are a number of implications of this difference compared to a mac fund arb funds are more focused on investment grade credit given the desire to be able to short it is very difficult to go short or quickly exit subinvestment grade positions there is a greater reliance on manager skill known as alpha to generate the returns in an arb fund a mac fund will tend to generate a greater proportion of its returns from exposure to the credit market known as beta manager selection and skill are vital for both arb and mac funds we would expect arb funds to fall less in the event of a downturn in credit markets they aim to be less volatile than mac funds in contrast we would expect lower long term returns from an arb fund than a mac fund of course there is a certain amount of generalisation in the above one of the key conclusions is that trustees need to decide on the type of credit exposure they want and which areas of the market they feel are most attractive only then should they consider the choice of manager   so how might a pension scheme use a macarb fund in addition to getting a broader exposure to the credit market the other key advantage of a mac arb fund is that they will have little or no strategic exposure to duration the box below sets out how this may be achieved most will benchmark themselves against libor or some other measure of cash returns this offers two potential uses to pension funds the primary use in our opinion and where they have generally been used to date is alongside an ldi mandate in this scenario trustees separate out the two reasons for holding credit within a portfolio liability protection and excess return here the ldi hedging portfolio through swaps repos etc provides the interest rate and inflation protection the credit portfolio is then used to outperform the liability benchmark an alternative use would be for those who hold a traditional credit mandate and still want exposure to credit spreads but feel that the yield curve is currently underestimating the rate of future rises in yields as regular readers know we don t feel this risk will materialise and whilst yields will inevitably rise we feel the market is currently broadly pricing this in correctly so how do macarb funds remove the interest rate risk associated with credit investments again this varies significantly from fund to fund so trustees will need to understand the mechanics of the fund they are investing in common approaches include use derivatives for example short gilts to remove the interest rate risk from a corporate bond also held in the portfolio investment in floating rate bonds where the coupon payment is set relative to libor these will include secured loans floating rate high yield bonds and abs the key point is that trustees need to be aware that this is a twoway risk as central bankers seem to be trying to remind the market at the moment in the event that yields rise but more slowly than expected a liborbased credit fund is likely to underperform a market benchmarked credit fund  of  a true partnership approach so is now a good time to invest in such a fund if the reduction in yields and spreads on the current portfolio mean your overall portfolio is not expected to generate the returns needed under the funding strategy then trustees need to make their assets work harder or increase employer contributions the former may mean potentially holding lower rated assets the search for yield or aiming for greater active manager returns which part of the market you select to invest in will largely depend upon your return requirements and any constraints over shortterm performance some key questions that will need to be addressed are investment grade or subinvestment grade credit tolerance for potential shortterm losses long term or shortterm holding your belief in active management your views on certain sections of the credit market once these questions have been answered you can then decide the macarb fund to consider given spreads are currently low return expectations need to be tempered for such a mandate so what should trustees be doing macarb investing is certainly not a onesizefitsall approach that is suitable for all schemes what trustees should be doing is reexamining their approach to managing credit risk this assessment needs to be made in the context of the changing characteristics of the credit market the deterioration in spreads back towards the lows seen precrisis in certain sectors and the falling levels of liquidity they should be considering the dual role that credit plays within that portfolio and consider whether their existing approach remains the most efficient way of meeting its twin objectives liability protection and return enhancement we feel the existing approach can be improved upon in many cases by separating out the dual roles of a traditional credit portfolio and giving the manager freedom to allocate across assets and securities a more effective portfolio can be established the key though is for trustees to first define their objectives and only then to start considering potential managers although many funds have similar names what goes on under the bonnet will be vastly different almost all areas of credit have provided exceptional returns over the past  years this is extremely unlikely to be repeated over the next  years careful consideration therefore needs to be taken in deciding whether to increase the overall level of credit exposure at this time however it may be an please contact your barnett waddingham consultant if you would like to discuss any of the above topics in more detail
