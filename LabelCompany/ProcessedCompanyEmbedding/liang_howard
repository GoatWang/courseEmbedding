driven cycle for more specifics on our third quarter let me turn it over to howard howard hideshima thank you charles and good afternoon everyone i will focus my remarks on earnings gross margins operating expenses and similar items on a nongaap basis which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses reconciliation of gaap to nongaap is included in the financial statements of the company in todays earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call let me begin with a review of the third quarter income statement please turn to slide  revenue was  million its a record third quarter for super micro up about  from the same quarter a year ago and down  sequentially the increase in revenue from last year was widespread in terms of market verticals we saw growth in storage enterprise iot and accelerated computing this was offset in part by decline in internet data center and cloud on a geographic basis we had strong growth in asia of  followed by europe at  and the us at  while the other was down by  the  sequential decrease in revenues was less than seasonal declines we experienced over the past  years of  and negative  the improvement over normal historical seasonality was primarily driven by our strength in asia up  and in other regions up  in particular china was up  as we leverage our growing partnerships slide  turning to product mix proportion of revenues from server systems was about  which is comparable to  the same quarter a year ago and from  last quarter we shipped approximately  nodes in the quarter which compares to  in the prior quarter and  in the prior year asps per compute node was about  per node versus  per node last quarter and  per node last year we shipped approximately  subsystems and accessories which is up from  last year and down from  last quarter we continue to maintain our diverse revenue base with over  customers no customers represented more than  of our quarterly revenues cloud internet data center revenue was  which was a decrease from  in the prior quarter and a decrease from  in the prior year  of our revenues came from the us and  from our distributors and resellers slide  nongaap gross profit was  million up  from  million in the same quarter last year and down  from  million sequentially on a percentage basis gross margin was  down from  a year ago and from  sequentially price changes from ablecom resulted in no basis point change to the gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately  of total cost of goods sold compared to  a year ago and  sequentially the yearoveryear decrease in gross margin of  basis points was primarily due to the cost increase of memory and ssd components which we could not pass on to some of our server customers as well as many of our systems being based on mature late lifecycle processors such as grantley which means lower prices geographically we had higher sales in asia where pricing is typically more competitive utilization on a global capacity basis was lower at about  compared to about  a year ago this resulted in approximately  basis points of negative effect on gross margin sequentially gross margin was down  basis points primarily due to the cost of memory and ssd components continuing to rise during the quarter which in some cases was over  which we could not pass on to some of our server customers in addition lower utilization of our global capacity which was  down from  last quarter resulted in  basis points gross margin decrease slide  operating expenses were  million up from  million in the same quarter a year ago and from  million sequentially as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were  which is up from  in the same quarter a year ago and up from  sequentially operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis yearoveryear by  primarily in rd as we invested in personnel expenses to support the development of our total solutions and rollout of new products for the upcoming technology refresh cycle we increased  headcounts in rd which is about a  increase sequentially operating expenses were higher by  million or  primarily due to translation foreign exchange loss of  million which is a  million delta from last quarter and  million higher rd component  compensation expense in authorical the  million foreign exchange loss represented about  in fully diluted eps the companys total headcount increased by  sequentially to  total employees primarily in operations to support the growth of the business operating profit was  million down by  from  million a year ago and down by  from  million sequentially on a percentage basis operating margin was  down from  a year ago and down from  sequentially net income was  million up  from  million a year ago and down  from  million sequentially on a nongaap fully diluted basis eps was  per share which is up from  per share a year ago and down from  per share sequentially the number of fully diluted shares used in the third quarter was  the tax rate in the third quarter on a nongaap basis was  compared to  a year ago and  sequentially the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal year  was lower than last year due to the release of liability for completion of a tax audit in foreign jurisdiction we expect our effective tax rate to be about  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis slide  cash and cash equivalents short and long term investments were  million down  million from  million in the prior quarter and down  million from  million in the same quarter last quarter in the third quarter free cash flow was a negative  million primarily due to an increase in inventory of  million an increase in ar of  million offset in part by an increase in accounts payable of  million and net income of  million accounts receivable increased by  million to  million due to higher revenue at the end of the quarter as customers came back from the lunar new year holiday dso was  days an increase of  days from  days in the prior quarter inventory increased  days to  million days in inventory were  an increase of  days from  in the prior quarter and an increase of  days from  in the prior year the increase is primarily to support the continuing tight supply of memory and ssd and sourcing for new product lines related to the skylake launch as well as for the upcoming seasonally strong quarter had we excluded the increase in ssd and memory from september quarter and  of about  million our days of inventory would have been  days accounts payable was  million  up  million which was  days an increase of  days from  days in the prior quarter and down  days from  days in the prior year overall cash conversion cycle days was  days which is  days higher than the prior quarter and the same quarter of last year adjusting for the effect of the increase in inventory in ssd and memory as noted above the cash conversion cycle days would have been  now for a few comments on our outlook as we enter the last quarter of fiscal  we see strong growth opportunities from a technology refresh cycle especially in the skylake launch we continue to see strong traction for our leading solutions in our growing customer base especially in large enterprise these factors coupled with investments we have made during the past year put us on our strongest position to accelerate our growth in the many market verticals we serve therefore the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending june   in a range of  million to  million assuming this revenue range the company expects nongaap earnings per diluted share of approximately  to  for the quarter at the midpoint this would represent an increase of  in revenue and  in eps from the prior year it is currently expected that outlook will not be updated until the release of the companys next quarterly earnings announcement notwithstanding subsequent developments however the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time with that let me turn it back to charles for some closing remarks charles liang thank you howard were now reaping the benefits of our very strong ambitions that we have built over a long period of time this quarters revenue was the strongest third quarter in our history and again demonstrates the advantages of our product portfolio across many different verticals especially among our enterprise customers with that im very confident that our strong foundation and products will make super micro one of the most successful companies in the it industry operator at this time were ready for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and well go first to aaron rakers with stifel joseph quatrochi okay great this is joe quatrochi on for aaron i was just curious i wanted to kind of double click on the ssd constraints that youre still seeing did that impact your ability to fulfill or rather recognize additional revenue in the quarter charles liang i guess its both because of that shortage we saw some indiscernible relationship and the other reason is that because the price rose so we had to raise the price to customer so that too did impact our business joseph quatrochi okay and how do you think about that going into the current quarter do you see a similar impact charles liang looks like both fee dwen and flash memory ssd will continue to rose in price but where we also get in accessorized so wont grow that much as the last few quarter i would have to say for example in module in last  quarter the price had been grow almost double so next quarter or  quarter i guess the growth will be slower joseph quatrochi okay and then just for follow up can you talk about the timing of skylake relative to what mellanox had kind of talked about last night it seemed like they might be seeing a little bit of a pushout i was just curious if youre seeing any difference from what we talked about  days ago charles liang yes the good news is skylake our product have been developing very smoothly so today we have almost complete product line ready to ship and we already promised to some customer start ship early next month and india official launch i believe is still early july operator and well go next to mark kelleher with da davidson mark kelleher howard i want to talk a little bit about the gross margins is this the low point do you think the  or do the continued price hikes in the memory mean were going to dip below that howard hideshima mark this is howard thanks again december as a quarter we dont typically guide gross margin but december as a quarter is usually a very seasonally strong quarter compared to  im sorry the june quarter is particularly a strong quarter compared to the march quarter so typically its not as competitive as the march quarter so we get usually a margin boost from that however as charles alluded to the tightness in ssd and memory is still out there were saying were doing our best to manage our way through that and have done better i think probably in the last quarter versus the september quarter so were  december quarter so were going to continue to do that as well mark kelleher and are you going to continue to build inventory of memory to stay ahead of this and when do you have the cash kind of burning some cash here how do you feel about your cash position howard hideshima were okay with regards to cash position mark and we have lines of credit that we can draw upon and can expand it and access the capital there mark kelleher but inventory is still going to go up or putting more memory in howard hideshima were preparing right now for the launch  for the skylake launch coming up here so some of the inventory build from this last quarter was for a part of that per se and then part of that was for the larger quarter so if you look at the end of the june quarter typically youll see a decline in our inventories because we come out of a seasonally strong quarter going into somewhat of a seasonally weak quarter operator and well move next to mehdi hosseini david ryzhik this is david ryzhik for mehdi hosseini so it is already almost a quarter of overall revenue and you guys delivered some strong growth in china what areas of the product portfolio are most responsible for that growth and i had a followup charles liang for china i believe still our nvme and ssd product line have been very attractive in the market and also kind of highdensity storage as well as gpu for ai i mean machine learning people learning those areas have been growing very strongly in china market david ryzhik great and for nextgen storage obviously very impressive growth so  questions is this an above gross margin business for you and the other one is just wanted to understand it seems like some of the larger storage oems are pivoting to this supply model for thirdparty sourcing for hardware how big of an opportunity do you view this to be and are you selling any nextgen storage into the enterprise opportunity and do you see that as an opportunity for you charles liang yes indeed nextgen storage will continue to grow customers and also our customer are growing plus we have a more  new architectural advantage for the market for example coming soon op from intel and as well as the people  some people call jbof  jbod for fresh solution so we have a very strong product and lots of new architecture is coming david ryzhik great and would this be an above gross margin business for you charles liang theoretically it will but because memory and ssd prices are rising very fast so that may offset our margin for short term but long term yes operator and well take our next question from alex kurtz with pacific crest securities david kurtz could you take us through the dynamics again howard on the data center  the internet data center business and it looked like one of your strategic  data center customers was talking about expansion recently so thats question one sort of what are the dynamics in the june quarter guidance around that vertical and what happened in march and then also one of your strategic emerging storage partners was acquired by one of your competitors and was just wondering what the plan is there as far as working with that emerging storage vendor going forward now that theyre part of a larger entity howard hideshima okay alex thanks with regards to the internet data center cloud area we noted in the call that represented about  of our revenues in the previous quarter in the march quarter thats down from  last year youll recall that we had about a  customer last year that we did in the greenfield opportunities and buildouts there but thats a customer  still purchasing from but thats majority of the decrease that happened between years per se as we talk about going forward were still selling to that customer and again with the technology refresh cycle coming up it presents opportunities for us to do again not just refreshes with them but with other customers as well so were pretty bullish on the internet data center vertical for ourselves going forward as well as we enter there charles liang and the good thing is we start again impede to say lots of new customers new private cloud especially that help our business grow for long term and as to the you just mentioned some of our customer was bought by a big company were improving that relationship so it looks like so far so good david kurtz okay so theres no plans on them moving to their own contract manufacturer partners immediate plan is to keep it with you guys charles liang so far we feel pretty good operator well move next to nehal chokshi from maxim group nehal chokshi on the gross margin however just to be clear the component charges or price increases rather if it had not been for that it sounds like then you wouldve actually had a gross margin uptick qoverq is that the correct way to interpret this howard hideshima yes theres still pressure out there yes i mean if you look at the  basis points of decline in our gross margin sequentially  basis points was attributable to the utilization per se if there was not any of this memory type stuff i believe its fair to say that we would have gotten most of that back nehal chokshi so then it would have been flat qoverq had it not been for utilization decline and component price increases then howard hideshima it could have been higher i mean we also had the geographic that was in there that weighed us down a bit nehal chokshi okay and then data center was already talked about a little bit on the prior question but that was down qoverq and in the last quarter there was i think a good amount of excitement of having a more diversified base of hyperscalers and i think that large prior  customer that had gone from greenfield to just sort of maintenance increases that had already kind of petered out so i guess my question is that the decline on a qoverq basis of the hyperscalers was that a surprise howard hideshima well i think if you look at the decline quarterover quarter again it went from about  of revenues in the prior quarter to about  if you look at our seasonality again and not to say that theyre totally tied to seasonality youll see us anywhere from  to  down sequentially over the last couple of years so some of this has to do with seasonality i wouldnt say that it was a decline or a loss of opportunities i think we feel pretty good that we have more opportunities going forward and stronger in that segment than we have in previous quarters nehal chokshi okay very good by my math the revenue from the channel it accelerated quite significantly can you put a narrative behind that howard hideshima the revenue from the channel again the percentage of revenues again were  fairly stable there with regards to our  them being about  this current quarter and then  in the prior quarter so on an overall percentage basis they were fairly stable operator and we will take our next question from brian alger with roth capital partners brian alger i guess if were looking at the quarter theres  this time of the earnings season theres always a bit of mixed news im wondering if the strength relative to expectations from a demand standpoint was it all attributable to your  primary competitors going through major mergers in the past quarter and if so if you expect to be seeing any snapback or any normalization of market share that may have been gained howard hideshima yes brian this is howard if you talk about like for example  one person talked about nimble and hp in the storage area our storage area is very strong still and if its emc youre referring to with regards to dell going back its  again in the storage area were continuing to do great in the storage area as charles alluded to and were getting more customers in that base as we go so again were not seeing it slow down or just being  because of our partners doing mergers that were gaining more traction in that area brian alger okay i guess its sort of what i was getting at it wasnt as much focused on the storage side of it but rather just whenever a major merger is going through there tends to be an opportunity to gain share as channels oftentimes get conflicted but its good to hear you guys are gaining on the merits of the product portfolio moving forward you guys it seems as though are getting some good traction from the ai push and certainly there is a lot of attention being put towards the gpus and i noticed you highlighted the nvidia solutions as well as intels how  do you have a sense for how you stand relative to the competition there is there an advantage that you guys might have over call it the slowermoving oems in this space for that type of a customer charles liang indeed for both storage and gpu as well as xeonphi total market share i believe we will continue to grow in  area one is we continue to have more customer especially enterprise corporate customer and also were working with a superscale company as well so once we have good product i mean were openminded to work with any customer operator operator instructions and well move next to mehdi hosseini from susquehanna financial group david ryzhik its dave ryzhik again for mehdi howard can you talk about  how can we think about opex rolling over the balance of the year obviously your enterprise remains very small as a percentage of overall revenue and wed assume that you guys are continuing to invest in that in the sales and support effort just any way to think about opex over the balance of the year would be great howard hideshima this is howard again the opex this quarter was affected primarily  one of the major increases was basically the translational forex gainloss so again that would  you can  we dont predict that per se or fill that into our planning but again excluding that i think the first quarter is always the toughest at tax rates our peoples tax deductions get reset and what have you so that rolls into the compensation expense as we go throughout the year that gets filled up and it gets taken off from there apart from that were still focused on leveraging our op expense investment that we have made so again grow our revenues faster and were going to roll our operating expenses and see that leverage drop to the bottom line david ryzhik great and just to clarify the  microblade deployment is that in the enterprise revenue category charles liang yes for corporate private cloud basically operator and this does conclude the question and answer session of our conference call i would now like to turn the conference back over to mr liang for any closing remarks charles liang thank you for joining us today and looking forward to talking to you again at the
