nevada corporation entered into an agreement with m strata llc a nevada limited liability company and related party “m strata” “m strata agreement” whereby m strata granted to usmn permission and consent to mine the certain mineral products the “product” from certain mining claims owned or controlled by m strata located in panaca nevada  pursuant to the terms of the m strata agreement m strata designated which claims may be mined and usmn had the right to mine the product and remove the product from the mining claims so designated   the m strata agreement further provided that it was granting usmn the exclusive right to mine and purchase the product from m strata “exclusive right” and m strata agreed that it will not sell product or permit any other person or entity to purchase product or mine on the claims controlled by m strata other than usmn on condition that usnnm meets certain purchase minimums as defined in the agreement “purchase minimums” and makes timely payments therefor  in the event usmn fails to meet the purchase minimums for a period of one year then such exclusive right shall terminate and m strata shall be entitled to either i terminate the m strata agreement and cause usmn to terminate all mining operations on m strata’s claims or ii sell product to other purchasers in addition to usmn   usmn may cure any default in the purchase minimum by paying for the difference between the amount actually purchased in any one calendar year which was less than the purchase minimum and the amount actually ordered and paid for nothing in the m strata agreement conferred on usmn or its agents any rights of ownership in any mining claims owned or controlled by m strata now or in the future  in addition usmn agreed that it would only purchase calcium montmorillonite “product” from m strata and from no other source for the term of the m strata agreement or any extensions thereof   the initial term of the m strata agreement was for five  years and there was a provision for automatic extensions of the term for consecutive additional one  year terms thereafter  the m strata agreement provided for payments by usmn of  per ton of product removed from m strata’s claims subject to periodic adjustment for cost of living in accordance with the terms of the m strata agreement  payments for product were to be made by usnnm to m strata on a monthly basis upon presentation of invoices and in accordance with the terms of the m strata agreement there were monthly minimum purchases of product that were required to be made during the term of the m strata agreement dated october   m strata has agreed in the past to accept unregistered shares of common stock of usmn in consideration for the obligations of the company pursuant to the terms of the m strata agreement   a copy of the agreement was attached to the filing of a form k in november    the agreement was supplemented in  to include the right of the company to mine various rare earth minerals on the mining claims   on december   the company and m strata renegotiated the m strata agreement dated october   the company and m strata entered into the first amended and restated mining agreement effective as of november   amended m strata agreement the amended m strata agreement relieved the company of its contractual obligation to purchase a minimum annual amount of  tons of product the amended m strata agreement amends and substantially modifies the terms of the october   agreement at the time of the execution of the amended m strata agreement the company owed m strata  for product as part of the agreements between the company and m strata m strata agreed to accept  shares of   cumulative preferred stock in satisfaction of  of the company’s obligation to it and to cancel the remaining  of the amount owed            management believes the amended agreement is of significant and substantial benefit and value to the company because it eliminates the requirement that the company purchase a minimum of  tons of product per year whether or not it was able to sell such amount in each year or not at the current price calculated pursuant to the october   agreement of a total of  under the terms of the amended m strata agreement that minimum purchase requirement has been eliminated under the amended m strata agreement the company is only required to pay for product according to the greater of either i a minimum of one hundred tons a week at a price of  per ton a minimum amount of  per week or ii the actual amount of tons sold multiplied by  per ton accordingly the amended agreement no longer obligates the company to purchase a minimum of thousands of tons per year the amended agreement contains additional modifications and provisions which include but are not limited to the following     a the  per ton price will be subject to adjustment based on an annual price adjustment equal to the increase in the cost of living   b payment of the greater of the minimum or the actual amounts must be made weekly   c all mining costs and fees payable to all government agencies shall continue to be paid by the company   d all insurance requirements remain the same and   e the term of the amended m strata agreement has been extended for an initial term of  years and the company has the option to extend the term for an additional  years so long as it is not in default under any of its obligations at the time of the exercise of the extension   a copy of the agreement was attached to the filing of a form k on december     on

of regulation sk the company is not required to provide this information   item   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes thereto   forwardlooking statements   this annual report contains forwardlooking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to our management when used in this report the words believe anticipate expect estimate “intend” “plan” and similar expressions as they relate to us or our management are intended to identify forwardlooking statements these statements reflect managements current view of us concerning future events and are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions including among many others a general economic downturn a downturn in the securities markets federal or state laws or regulations having an adverse effect on proposed transactions that we desire to effect securities and exchange commission regulations which affect trading in the securities of penny stocks and other risks and uncertainties should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual results may vary materially from those described in this report as anticipated estimated or expected all forwardlooking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statement            results of operations   the following table shows the financial data of the consolidated statements of operations of the company for the year ended december   and december     the data should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the company and related notes thereto   year ended december   compared to year ended december         year ended

             as of december   cash totaled  and from the year ended december   cash increased by   this cash position was the result of net cash used in operating activities   we believe that the level of financial resources is a significant factor for our future development and accordingly we may choose at any time to raise capital through private debt or equity financing to strengthen our financial position facilitate growth and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities  the company is in the process of an offering of shares of common and preferred stock to be designated by the company  there is no guarantee that this offering will be completed and if completed the specific terms and conditions  we do not have immediate plans to have a public offering of our common stock and there is no guarantee that any such offering would be successful or be completed on terms which are beneficial to the company            critical accounting policies and estimates   in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events however events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and as such they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations financial position and liquidity we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results however the majority of our business operates in environments where we pay a fee for a service performed and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective nor complex   income taxes   the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  “income taxes” under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of i taxes payable or refundable for the current year and ii deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized   asc topic  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return asc topic  provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition we have no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented   revenue recognition   the company purchases calcium montmorillonite clay pursuant to an agreement with a related party who owns the land and mine containing such clay and resells the product for agricultural uses revenue from the sale of product obtained from our mining contractor is recognized when ownership passes to the purchaser at which time the following conditions are met   i persuasive evidence that an agreement exists ii the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the purchaser including delivery of the product iii the selling price is fixed and determinable or iv collectively is reasonably assured            stock based compensation   stock based compensation is accounted for using the equitybased payments to nonemployee topic of the fasb asc which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments we determine the value of stock issued at the date of grant we also determine at the date of grant the value of stock at fair market value or the value of services rendered based on contract or otherwise whichever is more readily determinable   stock based compensation for employees is account for using the stock based compensation topic of the fasb asc  we use the fair value method for equity instruments granted to employees and will use the black scholes model for measuring the fair value of options if issued the stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed measurement date and is recognized over the vesting periods   going concern   the company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern  this contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business  currently the company does not have significant cash or other material assets nor does it have operations or a source of revenues sufficient to cover its operational costs and allow it to continue as a going concern     the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which contemplate continuation of the company as a going concern  as of december   the company’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by  and it has an accumulated deficit of  these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern  these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty we will need to raise funds or implement our business plan to continue operations    in order to continue as a going concern the company will need among other things additional capital resources management’s plan is to obtain such resources for the company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity andor debt financing however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   balance sheet arrangements   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors   contractual obligations   the

refundable for the current year and ii deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns deferred

compensation is accounted for using the equitybased payments to nonemployee topic of the fasb asc which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments we determine the value of stock issued at the date of grant we also determine at the date of grant the value of stock at fair market value or the value of services rendered based on contract or otherwise whichever is more readily determinable   stock based compensation for employees is account for using the stock based compensation topic of the fasb asc  we use the fair value method for equity instruments granted to employees and will use the black scholes model for measuring the fair value of options if issued the

periods     f          fair value measurements   we adopted the provisions of asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis which approximates their fair values because of the shortterm nature of these instruments the carrying amounts of our short and long term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective yields on these obligations which include contractual interest rates taken together with other features such as concurrent issuances of warrants andor embedded conversion options are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk   asc  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value   level  — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable level  — inputs that are unobservable for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions

jacob keplerbloomberg the head of an advancedmaterials manufacturer said he met with president donald trump’s chief strategist steve bannon on monday to persuade him that the us should nationalize the country’s only mine of rare earth minerals which are used in military applications“the staff understood the urgency of the matter” michael silver chief executive officer of closely held american elements corp said in a phone interview after his white house meeting which he said was also attended by presidential deputy assistant sebastian gorka and white house chief of staff reince priebusthe rareearth mining operations in mountain pass california the last remaining assets of bankrupt molycorp inc were bought in june by a group that drew objections from rival bidders who said the winner has ties to the chinese government the mine should be converted to a national laboratory “dedicated to rebuilding america’s rareearth mining industry so the world knows it is safe to build hightech manufacturing plants in the us” silver saidthe production of rareearth minerals  used in applications from hybrid electric cars to iphones and military hardware such as nightvision goggles and guided weapons  is dominated by lowcost chinese companies molycorp minerals and its parent molycorp inc filed for bankruptcy in  after prices for the minerals fell below the mine’s costs to produce themsilver said he was invited to brief the president on the issue on tuesday the white house didn’t respond to requests for comment eminent domainsilver said he’s proposing the us government apply the takings clause of the th amendment and acquire mountain pass by eminent domainany attempt to make the mine commercially viable would fail because no one can compete with china which accounts for almost all the world’s rareearth production silver said “the perception is the only place in the world you can go for reasonably priced rare earth materials for your product is in china” he said “you

to the root of agriculture problems healthier planet – healthier people world health and agriculture science sources have noted an alarming decline in the nutrient density of the world’s produce over the past  years at the very same time leading nutritional researchers are targeting dietary nutrient and mineral deficiencies as likely contributors to an epidemic of unprecedented health disorders worldwide the fact is that an extremely high percentage of our world’s agricultural topsoils that have not already been lost to erosion have become dangerously depleted of their original minerals and micronutrients these natural complexes are essential to optimal soil fertility and sustainable productivity clearly this is a global problem requiring a global solution rare deposits of rich mineral complexes in their natural forms do exist however they are rarely as commercially available and in as potent of a form as excelerite® further most humans plants and animals in our everexpanding world population centers do not enjoy easy and affordable access to these resources and of no less concern is the mounting toxification of the world’s soils that are now experiencing the devastating effects of excess artificial fertilization through runoff precious waterways lakes and oceans are also impacted these conditions are destroying the balance of our ecosystem however there is good news at hand leading agronomists especially those focused on the emerging soil sciences of “bioremediation” and “sustainable agriculture” have discovered that the process of restoring the natural health richness and productivity to the world’s agricultural soils can be greatly aided through remineralization by making a pure rich and highly assimilable source of mother nature’s own natural mineral and micronutrient complexes available worldwide at affordable prices the leadership distributors and shareholders of us rare earth minerals inc contribute daily to this important emerging market and global mission the genesis of excelerite® excelerite® originates from a geothermal active “caldera” or volcanic crater region which over millions of years first began as an ocean bed and later as a lake bed collected trapped and filtered an incredibly rich ancient variety of essential minerals and micro and macronutrients the mineral and nutrient compounds that comprise excelerite® have a multicentury reputation for being remarkably supportive of human animal and agricultural health from the time that indians inhabited nevada select portions of this rare earth have been the source of story lore about powerful healing abilities in fact it is often told that when pioneers were traveling through nevada and settling the west their mules would literally pull off from the wagon train to paw at and eat from the dirt which delivered restorative results that were apparently stunning today through the vision and dedication of the evolving management team utilizing the seasoned input from an advisory board of industry science and business experts the power of this gift of nature called excelerite® is being distributed in every u s state and a growing number of major markets worldwide a

images china is by far the world’s leading producer and exporter of minerals and metals the nation also is proving increasingly expert at using its mineral resources to influence geopolitics even those minerals and metals that are mined outside china find their way there via the world’s most sophisticated supplychain networks – all according to the design of beijing’s leadersby contrast the united states is  percent importreliant on more than  key minerals and metals essential both to a healthy economy and our national security most of these are partially if not totally supplied by china which enjoys near complete market power over the allimportant rare earth parts industryrare earth elements rees are essential components of modern hightech electronic equipment notably rees enable the hightech magnets used in everything from iphones to joint direct attack munitions jdams from the whitenoiseconcealment stealth technology used for helicopter rotors to ship and aircraft motors rees are found in every computer flat screen guidance system directed energy weapon and laser among many more critical technologies in short rees are indispensable to our economy and national defensechinas monopoly of the global ree market should be no surprise almost  years ago deng xiaoping boldly stated “the middle east has its oil china has rare earth” from then until now china steadily has increased its rare earth dominance to roughly  percent of the market using a combination of overproduction and price manipulation to drive out competitors because western scientific efforts have thus far failed to develop new reliable costeffective ree substitutes companies that need access tend to relocate to china china also has used its ree monopoly as a geopolitical bludgeon since the s chinese authorities have pursued an explicit policy of controlling a resource they considered “strategic and critical” china’s manipulation of the global supply of rees received heightened attention in  when they halted ree exports to japan in response to a fishing dispute near a set of islands claimed by both countriesus domestic resource extraction offers no real solution at least in the short term though the country is home to ree ores the united states lacks the manufacturing chain to turn those ores into useable parts building a mine domestically takes upward of a decade thanks to permitting and infrastructure issues domestic industry also would have to contend with china’s manipulation of the global supply chain us rare earth producers have tried to compete and been bankrupted in the past including the biggest rare earth miner—molycorp in  thus a pressing question for the administration is how to address this reliance on china a strategic competitor to obtain what are critical and strategically important materialswe propose forming a usbased privately funded and managed rare earth cooperative—comprising companies that require rare earths to manufacture magnets electronics alloys and rare earth metals—that would focus on turning ree ores into useable parts a coop would enable end users to act together without violating antitrust law to procure finished ree products that currently are available only from china this value chain could provide a market for the united states vast available ree resources without being undercut by the chinese monopolycooperatives have long been an american solution to market failures for example newgeneration cooperatives ngc developed in the s in california and the midwest are tailored specifically for use by modern capitalintensive industries that add value to primary products such as those involved in the production of ethanol from corn a rare earth coop would function similarly by developing a domestic rare earth supply chain by and for the benefit of downstream american manufacturers and our alliescoop members could be granted a federal “charter” which would demonstrate a national commitment to overcome china’s dominance of the rare earth market but without direct government involvement a coop model has the potential to redirect the flow of capital jobs and technology related to the rare earth industry away from china and toward a reliable domestic solution—a highly desirable goal for this totally importdependent group of mineralschina can hardly be blamed for its clever use of global mineral resources decades of unsustainable us mineral resource policies have contributed mightily to our present state of dependence if a rare earth cooperative proves as successful as other american coops not only would it alleviate rare earth supply problems but it could represent a template for domestic production of other critical minerals on which the united states is entirely or almost entirely importdependentthe trump administration has pledged its commitment to embark on a massive infrastructure rebuilding program minerals and metals are the backbone of the nation’s infrastructure with our national security at stake the time to form a rare earth cooperative is now bold and resourceful action to create a domestic ree value chain can mitigate the national security

more honeybees and agriculture – us rare earth minerals inc honeybees and agriculture the unexplained rise in honeybee deaths – mainly due to high winter losses in honeybee colonies in the eu and ‘colony collapse disorder’ ccd in the usa – has become an issue of great concern as honeybees are one of the most important pollinators for wild plants and crops they are closely linked to both agriculture and biodiversity since  there has been a  percent rise in the managed honeybee population worldwide nonetheless in recent years a number of beekeepers have experienced serious bee losses in europe the us and elsewhere in the usa adult bees have been disappearing from colonies since  abandoning their queen their brood and their food reserves in what has been termed ‘colony collapse disorder’ ccd in contrast a number of european beekeepers have witnessed unusually high bee colony losses during winter since the s reliable surveys have estimated colony losses of  to  percent in the period  to  with a peak over the  winter losses of around  percent would previously have been considered normal separately there have been occasional reports of bee poisoning caused by the mismanagement of crop protection products a variety of interlinked factors are potentially to blame there is a growing belief that interacting factors including parasites diseases nutrition beekeeping practices weather patterns and genetics may be challenging the survival of bees parasites and viruses can spread easily in today’s highly connected world both varroa destructor a parasitic mite and vector of viruses and nosema spp a parasitic fungus weaken immunity and bee health as a result many viruses – previously known to cause no symptoms of illhealth in bees – have become fatal the limited genetic diversity of honeybees – bred from a limited number of lines to become less aggressive and more productive – may also affect immunity for example it is estimated that the entire honeybee population of the usa can be traced to  queens modern farming has also reduced the variety of pollens within the agricultural landscape impacting bee diet and also immunity new stresses have been created by the bees’ changing environment as commercial pollination requires beekeepers to transport hives over long distances to foreign environments while confined in close proximity to each other climate change can be considered as another factor bringing harsher winters and wetter springs to europe young bees that survive these conditions often have impaired health us rare earth minerals inc
