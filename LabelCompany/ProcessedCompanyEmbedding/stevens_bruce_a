 our price  availability usually ships in  to  business days product code dvd description technical specs   two matches on one dvd ethan andrews vs colt stevens young colt made a small splash in his debut against dash decker even though he lost the match and had his new pair of  sunglasses smashed to smithereens by the big guy for most of the match he was dominated by the imposing muscles and steel will of one of the most formidable opponents on the roster dash overpowered colt in his debut but the teen wrestler and mma fighter did show signs of advanced wrestling and mma skills as he twisted and tortured dash�s prized physique when he was on top so the rookie has shown signs of promise but in this match he takes on another opponent that has made a living out of beating up on the muscle boys and rookies and these days ethan is oozing even more confidence after teaming with gage cardona in a  on  beating of the muscle stud fratboy alex waters and then teaming with gage again for the green team as they surprisingly defeated and humiliated the dream team of alex and dash in light of the current events colt certainly is going to have his hands full with resident street punk and bad boy ethan with the influx of mma and other contact sports included on the resumes of many of the wrestlers it�s inevitable that there is debate in the locker room as to which of the other arts can have a greater impact in the wrestling ring colt has professional mma experience so naturally the sly teen thinks this will work to his advantage while ethan has been training in boxing over the past year and has added this to his growing list of combat sports experience in his arsenal round one begins with the two of them sizing each other up and debating the mma vs boxing advantage the sly teen is no slouch when it comes to head games either as he works on psyching ethan out by flexing his teen muscles in his face ethan smiles at this ploy since he�s sporting his own sizzling hot lean muscled body and has dominated much bigger muscles than the teenager is flexing the street punk strikes first with repeated jabs to the teen�s abs then flips him to the mat and stretches the blond boy out in a seated surfboard colt may have thought he had some quickness but he�s being outquicked at the onset ethan transitions the hold to a leg scissors squeezing colt�s blond locks while he taunts him he allows the mma fighter to get to his feet then connects with a flurry of jabs to his abs as he�s pushed back against the ropes the street punk bad boy loves to attack his opponent�s abs and he�s using the same game plan on the rookie he suplexes colt to the mat and delivers a few more shots to his teen abs ethan then drags colt over to the ropes so that he can choke him out then locks a texas cloverleaf leglock on colt�s lanky legs exerting extreme pressure on his lower back ethan asks him to tap but colt�s been in the cage before and it�s much too early for him to submit both guys get to their feet and colt goes on offense he choke slams ethan to the mat using his size advantage on the street punk colt starts displaying his arsenal of holds on ethan clamping on a tight leg lock then cinching a figure four around his throat as he pounds away at the bad boy�s pec the blond rookie drags ethan up to his feet by his hair and then whips him across the ring and connects with is size  white boot square on his chest this sends the bad boy crumbling to the mat colt connects with a few of his own ab punches as ethan is sprawled on the mat then he egotistically struts around the ring flexing his own teenage biceps for his fans this turns out to be a rookie mistake as it provides ethan time to recover and reverse the momentum when colt attempts to connect with another boot to ethan�s ripped midsection the bad boy�s quick enough to grab colt�s leg before it lands and takes the teen rookie to the mat once ethan has him on the mat he starts an assault on the rookie�s legs he stomps his hamstrings then makes him agonize in a figure four leg lock then sends him reeling with a wicked clothesline the bad boy has things in control as he hoists colt up over his shoulders then power bombs him to the mat colt is wincing in pain as he cries out �my back my back� ethan pulls him to his feet laces his wiry teen body through the ropes pulls back on his arms into to surfboard and really starts applying the pressure you have to think colt�s never experienced this hold in an mma match so as much as he tries to fight it ethan continues to amp up the pressure until the blond rookie is forced to scream out �i give up� colt dangles in the ropes in pain before the bad boy pulls him back into the ring by his blond beiber style hair places his black boot on his stomach and flexes his baseball sized biceps in conquest of round one round two starts with colt admitting �that was a good round i�ll give you that but it was a round not a fight� ethan just smiles at the teenager�s attempt at intimidation and then colt pulls out something from behind the corner turnbuckle pad seems the rookie stashed a pair of  ounce mma gloves in the corner just in case he needed an advantage colt proceeds to put on the gloves while ethan explains �boxing is a sweet science while mma is nothing but caged animals� this doesn�t sit well with the sly teen as he retorts �don�t ever say that again� before the two lock up colt strikes with several knees to ethan�s ripped abs tosses him to the mat lifts him up to suplex him back to the mat then locks on a leg scissors around the street punk�s throat wanting to squeeze the life out of him colt has seemed to find a groove and he continues to throw toss and flip ethan�s lean muscled body around the ring at will he lifts the bad boy to his feet only to drop kick him back into the turnbuckle ethan is slumped in the corner and as the sly teen pulls him to his feet and begins to parade him around the ring ethan reverses the action with an atomic knee drop that sends shivers up the blond teen�s spine colt winces in pain holding his ass as he lay face down on the mat will bad boy ethan run the young rookie through his vast array of punishing holds and impose his will on the cage fighter to chalk up another victory or can the sly teen regain his senses and turn this ring into his cage and rely on his mma experience and size advantage to trap the punk in a mma submission to even this match at one round a piece colt has shown signs of brilliance but will that be enough to claim a victory all the sensational and stimulating action leads up to a knock out finish bruce ballard vs blake keller bruce has caused quite a stir since making his debut match here at rock hard he�s been an instant fan favorite with his movie star face and shredded bodybuilder physique he was able to notch a victory in his first match against fellow rookie tyson matthews and gave seasoned veteran austin cooper all that he could handle in his second match before succumbing to a horrific finishing hold that austin needed to pull out of his bag of tricks to thwart off the potential upset bruce is determined to make the rock hard ring his own �house of bruce� as he works his way up through the roster in his climb to the top in this match he takes on a tall titian rookie by the name of blake keller blake is a towering �� and  lbs of beef and muscle he brings an athletic background and is an emerging fitness model though he has limited wrestling experience these two guys have bumped into one another on the fitness modeling circuit and come from the same region of the country so they do have some history before entering into this challenge today bruce is in �beast mode� for this match entering the ring in military camouflage shorts and black boots he pumps up his arms in the corner before slipping off the camo to reveal his signature black and blue square cut trunks putting on a show for his fans across the ring blake is clad in burgundy square cuts and white boots which highlight his golden brown tan not impressed with the bodybuilder�s prematch antics round one opens with bruce explaining the parts of the ring to the rookie saying �this is the turnbuckle this is the ropes and this is the floor you�ll be down there a lot� bruce muscles the newbie to the mat and stomps him on the back proclaiming �what i say the bigger they are the harder they fall� bruce lifts the tall titan to his feet to suplex him across the ring then continues to attack blake�s back with more stomps before grinding his knee into the small of his back the chosen one bruce has quickly been gaining confidence since stepping into the ring and his confidence is soaring in this match he lifts big blake into a reverse bearhug showing who�s got the real muscle in this match bruce drops him to the mat flexes his ripped body in adoration of his work then wraps his massive thighs around blake�s waist and begins choking the big boy out bruce then works over blake�s abs in the corner but when he attempts to whip him into the opposite turnbuckle blake reverses the hold and bruce�s ripped body is the one that ends up in the opposite turnbuckle the tall titan senses an opening and goes on the attack he uses his considerable height advantage to his benefit lifting the bodybuilder up and over his shoulder then dropping him to the mat blake appears to know some moves as he grabs bruce�s wrist and ankle and begins to stretch his prized muscles to the limit bruce screams out in pain as blake drives his size  whit boot right through his ribcage blake isn�t afraid to inflict the pain as he asks the chosen one if he likes that he then transitions the hold to a reverse leg lock and bruce has got to be wondering how this rookie knows these kinds of moves blake is in control and loving it he cranks on the leg lock making the ripped bodybuilder suffer some more but bruce has been down this road before he�s able to fend off the big boy�s attack then regains the momentum when he ducks under an attempted clothesline bruce hoists blake up over his shoulders then dumps him to the mat he strikes the tall titan with a heavy fist to the back then places him in a camel clutch variation inflicting more pain on blake�s back the charming ripped bodybuilder then chokes his opponent out over the rope setting him up to finish him off bruce sets blake up to stretch his long legs out in a spladle directly attacking the tall titan�s height advantage bruce exerts his massive muscles stretching the big boy�s lanky long legs out and splitting his crotch to its limits he compels blake to submit by crying out �i give to bruce� to bring an end to round one bruce celebrates by flexing his glorious ripped biceps over his suffering foe round two opens with bruce asking �how�s that groin feel� with a sly grin on his face and telling blake he looks like a rookie who eats lots of cookies a direct reference to the tall titan�s lack of abs the ripped bodybuilder takes the early control with a stomp of his boot to blake�s gut then floors him with a clothesline and heart punch that immediately floors the rookie but blake showed promising signs of skill in the first round and he�s able to quickly change the momentum in this round he starts an attack on the good looking bodybuilder first with a boston crab variation then transitioning to a rear leg lock which has bruce groaning and squirming on the mat searching for any way to escape the big boy blake has bruce firmly in his control and isn�t letting up he pulls the bodybuilder to his feet then laces his glorious muscles through the ropes placing his boot squarely in bruce�s back and begins pulling back on his massive arms in a standing surfboard watching the bodybuilder�s fantastic physique suffer while stretched out in the ring ropes is spectacular site every one of his muscles stretched out in pain when bruce doesn�t submit blake pulls into the ring and into a headlock taking a moment to pose his own impressive bicep while he�s in control of the ripped bodybuilder the tall titan continues dishing out the punishment by wrapping his long legs around bruce�s trim waist and squeezes the life out of him bruce seems to be worn out by the onslaught attack and blake doesn�t waste any more time he flips bruce over into a boston crab and using his long legs to leverage even more pressure on his back it isn�t long before bruce is screaming out a submission the rookie flexes his own impressive muscles over the fallen bodybuilder knowing he just tied this match up at one round each in round three will fan favorite ripped bodybuilder be able to regain control of the big boy rookie and squeeze a victory out of him using his spectacular muscles or can the rookie tall titan blake continue to demolish and pick apart the bodybuilder�s piping hot body and commence his wrestling career with an improbable upset win in his debut
