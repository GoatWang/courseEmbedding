headquarters in three world financial center were severely damaged and rendered unusable by falling debris displacing over  employees the bank recovered quickly and rebuilt its presence trading operations moved across the hudson river to its jersey city new jersey facilities where an impromptu trading floor was built in a hotel and brought online less than fortyeight hours after the attacks when stock markets reopened on september   lehmans sales and trading capabilities were restored in the ensuing months the firm fanned out its operations across the new york city metropolitan area in over  temporary locations the investmentbanking division converted the firstfloor lounges restaurants and all  guestrooms of the sheraton manhattan hotel into office space the bank also experimented

located at  seventh avenue had recently been completed and not yet occupied by rival morgan stanley with morgan stanleys world headquarters located only two blocks away at  broadway in the wake of the attacks the firm was reevaluating its office plans which would have put over  employees in the times square area of new york city lehman began moving into the new facility in january and finished in march  a move that significantly boosted morale throughout the firm the firm was criticized for not moving back to its former headquarters in lower manhattan following the attacks only deutsche bank goldman sachs and merrill lynch of the major firms remained in the downtown area lehman however pointed to the facts that it was committed to stay in new york city that the new headquarters represented an ideal circumstance where the firm was desperate to buy and morgan stanley was desperate to sell that when the new building was purchased the structural integrity of three world financial center had not yet been given a clean bill of health and that the company could not have waited until may  for repairs to three world financial center to conclude after the attacks lehmans management placed increased emphasis on business continuity planning unlike its rivals the company was unusually concentrated for a bulgebracket investment bank for example morgan stanley maintains a

township new jersey aside from its headquarters in three world financial center lehman maintained operationsandbackoffice facilities in jersey city space that the firm considered leaving prior to  the space was not only retained but expanded including the construction of a backuptrading facility in addition telecommuting technology first rolled out in the days following the attacks to allow employees to work from home was expanded and enhanced for general use throughout the firm june  sec litigationedit in june  the company was one of ten firms which simultaneously entered into a settlement with the us securities and exchange commission sec the office of the new york state attorney general and various other securities regulators regarding undue influence over each firms research analysts by its investmentbanking divisions specifically regulators alleged that the firms had improperly associated analyst compensation with the firms investmentbanking revenues and promised favorable marketmoving research coverage in exchange for underwriting opportunities the settlement known as the global settlement provided for total financial penalties of  billion including  million against lehman and structural reforms including a complete separation of investment banking departments from research departments no analyst compensation directly or indirectly from investmentbanking revenues and the provision of free independent thirdparty research to the firms clients rise of mortgage originationedit lehman was one of the first wall street firms to move into

mortgage lender bnc mortgage llc lehman quickly became a force in the subprime market by  lehman made  billion in loans and ranked third in lending by  this number topped  billion by  aurora and bnc were lending almost  billion per month lehman had morphed into a real estate hedge fund disguised as an investment bank by  lehman had assets of  billion supported by only  billion of firm capital from an equity position its risky commercial real estate holdings were three times greater than capital in such a highly leveraged structure a  to  percent decline in real estate values would wipeout all capital collapseedit main article bankruptcy of lehman brothers causesedit malfeasanceedit a march  report by the courtappointed examiner indicated that lehman executives regularly used cosmetic accounting gimmicks at the end of each quarter to make its finances appear less shaky than they really were this practice was a type of repurchase agreement that temporarily removed securities from the companys balance sheet however unlike typical repurchase agreements these deals were described by lehman as the outright sale of securities and created a materially misleading picture of the firm’s financial condition in late  and  subprime mortgage crisisedit in august  the firm closed its subprime lender bnc mortgage eliminating  positions in  locations and took an aftertax charge of  million and a  million reduction in goodwill lehman said that poor market conditions in the mortgage space necessitated a substantial reduction in its resources and capacity in the subprime space in  lehman faced an unprecedented loss to the continuing subprime mortgage crisis lehmans loss was a result of having held on to large positions in subprime and other lowerrated mortgage tranches when securitizing the underlying mortgages whether lehman did this because it was simply unable to sell the lowerrated bonds or made a conscious decision to hold them is unclear in any event huge losses accrued in lowerrated mortgagebacked securities throughout  in the second fiscal quarter lehman reported losses of  billion and was forced to sell off  billion in assets in the first half of  alone

would be the next major investment bank to fall callan fielded lehmans first quarter conference call where the firm posted a profit of  million compared to citigroups  billion and merrill lynchs  billion losses which was lehman’s th consecutive profitable quarter the firms stock price leapt  percent after that announcement on june   lehman brothers announced us billion secondquarter loss its first since being spun off from american express as market volatility rendered many of its hedges ineffective during that time lehman also reported that it had raised a further  billion in capital as a result there was major management shakeup in which hugh skip mcgee iii head of investment banking held a meeting with senior staff to strip fuld and his lieutenants of their authority consequently joe gregory agreed to resign as president and coo and afterward he told erin callan that she had to resign as cfo callan was appointed cfo of lehman in  but served only for six months before departing after her mentor joe gregory was demoted bart mcdade was named to succeed gregory as president and coo when several senior executives threatened to leave if he was not promoted mcdade took charge and brought back michael gelband and alex kirk who had previously been pushed out of the firm by gregory for not taking risks although fuld remained ceo he soon became isolated from mcdades team on august   shares in lehman closed up   for the week on reports that the statecontrolled korea development bank was considering buying the bank most of those gains were quickly eroded as news came in that korea development bank was facing difficulties pleasing regulators and attracting partners for the deal it culminated on september  when lehmans shares plunged  to  after it was reported that the

lehmans sales and trading capabilities were restored in the ensuing months the firm fanned out its operations across the new york city metropolitan area in over  temporary locations the

significantly boosted morale throughout the firm the firm was criticized for not moving back to its former headquarters in lower manhattan following the attacks only deutsche bank goldman sachs and merrill lynch of the major firms remained in the downtown area lehman however pointed to the facts that it was committed to stay in new york city that the new headquarters represented an ideal circumstance where the firm was desperate to buy and morgan stanley was desperate to sell that when the new building was purchased the structural integrity of three world financial center had not yet been given a clean bill of health and that the company could not have waited until may  for repairs to three world financial center to conclude after the attacks lehmans management placed increased

commercial real estate holdings were three times greater than capital in such a highly leveraged structure a  to  percent decline in real estate values would wipeout all capital collapseedit main article bankruptcy of lehman brothers causesedit malfeasanceedit a march  report by the courtappointed examiner indicated that lehman executives regularly used cosmetic accounting gimmicks at the end of each quarter to make its finances appear less shaky than they really were this practice was a type of repurchase agreement that temporarily removed securities from the companys balance sheet however unlike typical repurchase agreements these deals were described by lehman as the outright sale of securities and created a materially misleading picture of the firm’s financial condition in late  and  subprime mortgage crisisedit in august  the firm closed its subprime lender bnc mortgage eliminating  positions in  locations and took an aftertax charge of  million and a  million reduction in goodwill lehman said that poor market conditions in the mortgage space necessitated a substantial reduction in its resources and capacity in the subprime space in  lehman faced an unprecedented loss to the continuing subprime mortgage crisis lehmans loss was a result of having held on to large positions in subprime and other lowerrated mortgage tranches when securitizing the underlying mortgages whether lehman did this because it was simply unable to sell the lowerrated bonds or made a conscious decision to hold them is unclear in any event huge losses accrued in lowerrated mortgagebacked securities throughout  in the second fiscal quarter lehman reported losses of  billion and was forced to sell off  billion in assets in the first half of  alone lehman stock

there was major management shakeup in which hugh skip mcgee iii head of investment banking held a meeting with senior staff to strip fuld and his lieutenants of their authority consequently joe gregory agreed to resign as president and coo and afterward he told erin callan that she had to resign as cfo callan was appointed cfo of lehman in  but served only for six months before departing after her mentor joe gregory was demoted bart mcdade was named to succeed gregory as president and coo when several senior executives threatened to leave if he was not promoted mcdade took charge and brought back michael gelband and alex kirk who had previously been pushed out of the firm by gregory for not taking risks although fuld remained ceo he soon became isolated from mcdades team on august   shares in lehman closed up   for the week on reports that the statecontrolled korea development bank was considering buying the bank most of those gains were quickly eroded as news came in that

and i apologize shortselling allegationsedit during hearings on the bankruptcy filing by lehman brothers and bailout of aig before the house committee on oversight and government reform former lehman brothers ceo richard fuld said a host of factors including a crisis of confidence and naked shortselling attacks followed by false rumors contributed to both the collapse of bear stearns and lehman brothers house committee chairman henry waxman said the committee received thousands of pages of internal documents from lehman and these documents portray a company in which there was no accountability for failure an article by journalist matt taibbi in rolling stone contended that naked short selling contributed to the demise of both lehman and bear stearns a study by finance researchers at the university of oklahoma price college of business studied trading in financial stocks including lehman brothers and bear stearns and found no evidence that stock price declines were

significantly boosted morale throughout the firm the firm was criticized for not moving back to its former headquarters in lower manhattan following the attacks only deutsche bank goldman sachs and merrill lynch of the major firms remained in the downtown area lehman however pointed to the facts that it was committed to stay in new york city that the new headquarters represented an ideal circumstance where the firm was desperate to buy and morgan stanley was desperate to sell that when the new building was purchased the structural integrity of three world financial center had not yet been given a clean bill of health and that the company could not have waited until may  for repairs to three world financial center to conclude after the attacks lehmans management placed increased

article bankruptcy of lehman brothers causesedit malfeasanceedit a march  report by the courtappointed examiner indicated that lehman executives regularly used cosmetic accounting gimmicks at the end of each quarter to make its finances appear less shaky than they really were this practice was a type of repurchase agreement that temporarily removed securities from the companys balance sheet however unlike typical repurchase agreements these deals were described by lehman as the outright sale of securities and created a materially misleading picture of the firm’s financial condition in

reduction in goodwill lehman said that poor market conditions in the mortgage space necessitated a substantial reduction in its resources and capacity in the subprime space in  lehman faced an unprecedented loss to the continuing subprime mortgage crisis lehmans loss was a result of having held on to large positions in subprime and other lowerrated mortgage tranches when securitizing the underlying mortgages whether lehman did this because it was simply unable to sell the lowerrated bonds or made a conscious decision to hold them is unclear in any event huge losses accrued in

gregory agreed to resign as president and coo and afterward he told erin callan that she had to resign as cfo callan was appointed cfo of lehman in  but served only for six months before departing after her mentor joe gregory was demoted bart mcdade was named to succeed gregory as president and coo when several senior executives threatened to leave if he was not promoted mcdade took charge and

and i apologize shortselling allegationsedit during hearings on the bankruptcy filing by lehman brothers and bailout of aig before the house committee on oversight and government reform former lehman brothers ceo richard fuld said a host of factors including a crisis of confidence and naked shortselling attacks followed by false rumors contributed to both the collapse of bear stearns and lehman brothers house committee chairman henry waxman said the committee received thousands of pages of internal documents from lehman and these documents portray a company in which there was no accountability for failure an article by journalist matt taibbi in rolling stone contended that naked short selling contributed to the demise of both lehman and bear stearns a study by finance

jf lehman  company chairman project for the new american century signatory former secretary of the navy please note ips right web neither represents nor endorses any of the individuals or groups profiled on this site john f lehman is a prominent advocate of militarist us security policies whose private equity business—jf lehman  company—focuses its investments on industries that stand to gain from increased spending on military and defense the secretary of the navy under ronald reagan and a member of the  commission lehman served as an adviser on defense issues to both the  john mccain presidential campaign and the  mitt romney campaign both of which promoted interventionist us defense platforms that adhered closely to the policy preferences of lehmanbacked neoconservative groups lehman’s support for militarist us foreign policies dates back to the s when he was a member of the s incarnation of the committee on the present danger cpd a hardline anticommunist group that worked to turn back the politics of détente with the soviet union after the  attacks lehman joined a group of neoconservative ideologues in signing the project for the new american centurys september   letter to president george w bush which notoriously argued that “even if evidence does not link iraq directly to the attack any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq failure to undertake such an effort will constitute an early and perhaps decisive surrender in the war on international terrorism” according to the jf lehman  company’s “philosophy” “jf lehman  company pursues an exclusive and consistent focus on investing in companies in the defense aerospace and maritime industries and the technologies that originate from them jf lehmans unique relationships and specialized knowledge enable the firm to effectively address these markets the firm focuses on the us and uk defense markets which are joined by close strategic and cultural alliances and are well known to the principals these sizeable markets are further augmented by jf lehmans ability to address companies whose defensebased technologies have attractive commercial applications”  romney surrogate as a surrogate for the  romney campaign lehman was accused of “derailing” romney’s message on foreign policy by trying to raise the specter of a “soviet” threat to america during a conference call with reporters in late april  lehman argued that obama was “withdrawing from leading the free world in maintaining stability around the world” to support this claim he said “we’re seeing the soviets pushing into the arctic with no response from us in fact the only response is to announce the early retirement of the last remaining icebreaker” this cold warera discourse was detected in romney’s own statements during a meeting with gop officials in april  romney said that obama had entered into an agreement with the soviets excuse me with russia in agreeing to a new start treaty limiting nuclear weapons arsenals commenting on the romney campaign’s fixation on a purported russian “threat” vice president joe biden said “romney acts like he thinks the cold war’s still on i don’t know where he’s been” lehman also attacked obama for using a campaign ad to take credit for the decision to kill osama bin laden and imply that romney would not have made the same decision shortly after the obama campaign released the tv ad—called “one chance”—in april  lehman and fellow romney surrogate frank carlucci said in a campaign press release “we are saddened to see the president of the united states politicize that event even reducing it to a campaign slogan this is unbecoming of the commanderinchief and it diminishes the credit that should rightfully go to our men and women fighting in the field” commenting on the romney campaign’s response to the obama commercial nbc’s david gregory said during an interview with romney adviser ed gillespie “its interesting though if you compare it to the president you worked for president bush and some of the same sort of tactics that were used in a lot of peoples eyes … using images from the world trade center a lot of people see that as the very same thing is it not focusing on leadership moments of a president”  mccain surrogate as an adviser to mccain on defense issues lehman frequently defended the senator’s policies on iraq and other national security issues in a july  interview with the national journal lehman rejected the idea that mccain was a cold warera hardliner saying “this is a guy who has for  years been a major figure in the annual munich national security conference a guy who knows leaders of all political persuasions in asia in europe and in africa he has been very actively involved in helping to support private relief groups and he understands that one of the greatest payoffs we could have in dealing with islamist fundamentalism is education assistance” on iraq lehman said “the senator believes strongly that we are succeeding in iraq and that this will enable us to steadily reduce operations as the iraqi government takes more and more responsibility well be less directly involved with lower and lower expenditures” iraq and the “war on terror” although a supporter of the  invasion of iraq lehman criticized the bush administrations handling of the war arguing that the united states needed to clarify its targets in the war on terror us conflicts post lehman argued are not with terrorism in general but with “violent islamic fundamentalism” in march  lehman gave an address at the us naval institute in which he argued that the united states was in a “religious war” an argument pushed by rightwing evangelicals and some other hardline proponents of the bush administration’s mideast policies he said “we had failed to grasp for a variety of reasons the new phenomenon that had emerged in the world this was not statesponsored terrorism this was religious war this was the emergence of a transnational enemy driven by religious fervor and fanaticism our enemy is not terrorism our enemy is violent islamic fundamentalism in an august  washington post oped lehman complained that “war on terror” was a misleading label that had “muddled” bush administration thinking lehman wrote the bush administration continues to muddle a national understanding of the conflict we are in by calling it the war on terror this political correctness presumably seeks to avoid hurting the feelings of the saudis and other muslims but it comes at high cost this is not a war against terror any more than world war ii was a war against kamikazes we are at war with jihadists motivated by a violent ideology based on an extremist interpretation of the islamic faith this enemy is decentralized and geographically dispersed around the world its organizations range from a fully functioning state such as iran to small groups of individuals in american cities lehman has argued that the united states is losing the war on three fronts the home front where the united states is vulnerable to a wmd attack by radical islamists the operational front which includes attacking al qaeda bases abroad and a strategicpolitical front where the united states is weakest because it has left itself vulnerable to other aggressors since it got bogged down in iraq iran somalia pakistan indonesia malaysia egypt algeria jordan north korea and china—“not one of these states believes that we can undertake any credible additional military operations while we are bogged down in iraq” lehman argued in a  washington post editorial according to lehman there is a growing threat from “homegrown” jihadists in the united states echoing neoconservativealigned groups like freedom house which in a  study argued that saudi “hate ideology” had “invaded” us mosques lehman argued that “the indoctrination and recruiting of jihadists from indonesia south asia and the middle east are carried out through religious establishments that are supported overwhelmingly by the saudi and iranian governments even in the united states some  of islamic mosques and schools are closely aligned with the fundamentalist wahhabist sect of islam and heavily dependent on saudi funding this allegation stands in stark contrast to studies undertaken by other groups including the institute for social policy and understanding which in a  study of detroitarea mosques found that only  percent of the citys mosqueattending population held ultraconservative wahabbist beliefs and concluded that the vast majority of american muslims eschew extremist views despite his criticism of the bush administrations chosen language regarding terrorism as a republican party member of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the  commission lehman was a reliable supporter of administration aims in the war on terror lehman told nbcs meet the press on june   that the  commission had documents captured in iraq that indicate that there is at least one officer of saddams fedayeen a lieutenant colonel who was a very prominent member of al qaeda lehmans comments strengthened the administrations faulty claims of an iraqalqaeda connection however the cia quickly dismissed the assertion saying that the documents did not support lehmans allegation early track record lehmans association with neoconservatism dates back to the s when he served on the board of the cpd a hardline advocacy outfit that aimed to roll back the détente policies with the soviet union also at that time lehman served as president of the abington corporation a lobbying firm that employed richard perle abington corporation received subcontracts from large defense contractors such as northrop corporation boeing and trw lehman carried his interest in weapons production into the reagan administration where he served as secretary of the navy lehman advocated an expansionist policy for the navy and he was a strong advocate of a more aggressive nuclear weapons policy in  as the nuclear freeze movement gained force lehman became a prominent critic of some religious figures for their implicit support of the freeze movement during the same period his brother christopher lehman also a conservative served as an aide to national security adviser william p clark jr one of lehmans bestknown endeavors was trying to create a ship navy that would be deployed aggressively around the world in fending off criticism of his plans lehman earned a reputation as an acerbic character one analyst describing the “abrasiveness” of the former secretary of the navy wrote that lehman “contemptuously dismissed critics of the navy buildup and carriers as ‘systems analysts’ ‘armchair strategists’ and ‘detentists’” inan oped about lehman’s tenure under reagan the new york times opined “mr lehmans certain achievements include his vigorous advocacy of competition among weapons suppliers which helped reduce the prices of ships and airplanes in scrapping the navy material command he abolished an entire layer of bureaucratic bloat… less admirable is the purpose and design of mr lehmans new navy the navys prime roles are providing nuclear deterrence with missile submarines diplomatic deterrence by showing the flag and keeping sea lanes open in event of conventional war with the soviet union but gunboat diplomacy doesnt require a large budget and sea lane patrol doesnt require a large naval force worse mr lehman embraced the reckless concept of sending carriers to attack the soviet mainland” additional policy advocacy lehman has remained active in policy circles he served as a member of the national security advisory council of the center for security policy a hardline policy group led by frank gaffney he has also supported the work of the foreign policy research institute fpri and the conservative heritage foundation in  lehman coedited the fpri volume america the vulnerable which contended that complacency in the united states had helped make the country vulnerable to the  attacks according to an fpri promo about the book some four years ago fpris leadership became convinced that our national security was slowly but surely eroding under the impact of several trends not least of which was complacency in our view emerging american vulnerabilities could and should be reduced without suffering another pearl harbor to awaken us to our responsibilities tragically on september   the united states was attacked in a latterday version of pearl harbor suicidal terrorists exacted a horrific toll of civilians both americans and those of many other nations… america now lives in a more dangerous time and we must improve our defenses across the board america the vulnerable contains suggestions to do just that other contributors to the volume included donald kagan eliot cohen keith payne henry sokolski and andrew bacevich lehman has supported the work of two purportedly centrist advocacy endeavors the partnership for a secure america an organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in american national security and foreign policy whose members include many former republican and democratic officials and securing americas future energy safe an actionoriented nonpartisan organization that aims to reduce americas dependence on oil addressing business and technology politics and advocacy and public education and media in fall  safe drew media headlines when it sponsored a roleplaying exercise which according to the washington post was meant to test responses to a scenario in which explosions disrupt a key pipeline that runs through azerbaijan unrest continues in nigeria and sour relations prompt a cut in output by iran and venezuela oil prices were said to hit  a barrel in the hypothetical scenario a starstudded cast played the roles of cabinet members and military chiefs former treasury secretary robert e rubin former deputy secretary of state richard l armitage author daniel yergin retired gen john p abizaid former environmental protection agency administrator carol browner former navy secretary john f lehman and others” according to the post the exercise was meant to underscore safes argument that the united states must reduce “dependence on oil for national security and economic reasons” lehman’s biography on his personal website describes a number of additional posts he has held in the public and private spheres “john lehman is chairman of jflehman  company a private equity investment firm he is also chairman of oao technology solutions director of ball corporation insurance services office sdi inc elgar inc and
