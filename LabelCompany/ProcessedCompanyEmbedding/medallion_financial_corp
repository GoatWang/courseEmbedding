relationships with marketplace lending platforms marketplace lending platforms would collaborate with medallion bank which would originate consumer loans which would be sold to the marketplace platforms with whom it will develop relationships as such no substantial capital of medallion bank will be required to support such lending and fee income will be paid to the bank medallion bank expects its return on equity to be equal or greater than its consumer lending business roe and anticipates in excess of a  return on equity medallion bank has elected to retain all of its earnings in this quarter instead of declaring a dividend to the company this is due in part to stronger than anticipated loan demand at the bank the company feels that the retention of earnings at the medallion bank level to support this strong loan demand and pretax return on equity of over  is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders due to the foregoing and the below business development company bdc and regulated investment company ric considerations medallion financial announced a distribution of  per share for the  second quarter this brings the total distributions declared over the last four quarters to  and equates to a yield of approximately  based on the closing price of the company’s stock on august   the current distribution will be paid on august   to shareholders of record on august   since the company’s initial public offering in  the company has paid or declared in excess of  or  per share in distributions the company further announced that its board of directors authorized management to take steps to analyze and determine whether its current structure as a bdc and ric is still a viable vehicle for medallion given its increasing focus on the growth and profitability of medallion bank a taxpaying noninvestment company whollyowned subsidiary if the company elects to convert from a bdc to a noninvestment company and to drop its ric election it would not be required to pay out  or more of its taxable income and could invest that income in the bank’s higher earning products in addition to that benefit the company may also realize tax efficiencies accretive to income by filing a consolidated tax return with all of its corporate tax paying operating subsidiaries the largest being medallion bank and potentially offsetting some of medallion bank’s taxable income against taxable losses in other smaller subsidiaries the primary benefit of being a ric is not paying a corporate level income tax however with almost all of the company’s earnings coming from medallion bank which is already paying taxes that benefit no longer exists although it had been a benefit in the past furthermore bdcs have not been permitted to be in certain stock indexes medallion previously was included in some of those indexes years ago before bdcs were removed thus if the company changes its structure from a bdc this year it could be eligible to be part of those indexes in the future which could lead to potential new purchases of the stock and potential increases in liquidity and the stock price medallion financial corp is a specialty finance company that originates and services loans in various commercial industries and its whollyowned portfolio company medallion bank also originates and services consumer loans the company and its subsidiaries have lent approximately  billion to small businesses please note that this press release contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to business
