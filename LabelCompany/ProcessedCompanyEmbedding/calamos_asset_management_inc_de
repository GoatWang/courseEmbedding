and  million as of december   and december   respectively for which the company provides model portfolio design and oversight assets under management our operating results fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of our assets under management and with our ability to manage variable expenses the following table details our assets under management based on the four

and market investment products and strategies that suit the investment needs of our target clients  investors seeking superior riskadjusted returns over the longterm the value and composition of our assets under management and our ability to continue to attract and retain clients will depend on a variety of factors including among others the amount of distributed and reinvested capital gains and income fluctuations in the global financial markets and the valuations of securities that result in appreciation or depreciation of assets the use of leverage within the closedend funds our ability to educate our target clients about our investment philosophy and provide them with bestinclass service the relative investment performance and volatility of our investment products as compared to competing offerings and market indices competitive conditions in the asset management and broader financial services sectors investor sentiment and confidence and our introduction of new investment strategies and products and our decision to close and reopen strategies when deemed in the best interests of our clients investment products and market appreciation or depreciation our revenues from closedend funds are derived from the investment management fees on the assets that we manage in addition in a typical underwritten public offering investors are charged a commission by the selling firms we do not receive or pay commissions in connection with sales of closedend fund shares although we may pay assetbased distribution and service fees as well as onetime distribution and service

we act as investment advisor are computed monthly on an average daily net asset value basis investment management fees that we earn on separate accounts for which we act as investment advisor and for which we provide model portfolio design and oversight are generally computed quarterly either in advance or in arrears based on the average assets under management or assets under management at the beginning or end of the quarterly period we recognize the revenues derived from these fees over the period during which we render investment advisory services distribution and underwriting fees component of distribution and underwriting fees distribution and underwriting fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors including the following total composition of our assets under management by share class market appreciation or depreciation and the level of sales and redemptions rule b distribution andor service fees are assetbased fees that the openend funds pay us over time pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of rule b of the investment company act these fees are typically calculated as a percentage of average daily net assets in specific share classes of the openend funds these fees fluctuate with both the level of average daily net assets and the relative mix of assets among share classes rule b fees are generally offset by distribution and service expenses paid during the period as well as the amortization of deferred sales commissions previously paid by us to third parties variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things incentive compensation changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors changes in distribution expense as a result of fluctuations in openend fund sales and level of redemptions market appreciation or depreciation of assets under management which will directly impact distribution expenses the amount of rule b distribution andor service fees that we receive as well as our continued ability to receive those fees in the future which would affect the amortization expenses associated with the receipt of these fees changes in the level of our marketing and promotion expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to further penetrate and support new and existing distribution channels and clients and expenses and capital costs such as technology

distribution fees       net distribution fee margin       the net distribution fee margin varies by share class so the mix of sales and assets by share class affects the overall net distribution fee margin the change in the net distribution fee margin is primarily due to the rate of the decline in revenue in all share classes and contingent deferred sales charge revenues compared with the decline in distribution expenses and amortization of deferred sales commissions nonoperating income income is allocated to noncontrolling interests based on the average ownership interest during the period in

adjusted nongaap financial measures including nongaap net income attributable to cam and nongaap diluted earnings per share these nongaap financial measures are provided to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap financial measures adjust gaap financial measures to include the tax benefit from the amortization of deferred taxes on intangible assets and cams nonoperating income net of taxes the company believes these adjustments are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of operating financial performance as well as to facilitate comparisons with historical earnings results these adjustments to the companys gaap results are made with the intent of providing investors a more complete understanding of the companys underlying earnings results and trends and marketplace performance in addition these nongaap financial measures are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis of managing our business the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap investors should review the reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures as provided in table a nongaap net income attributable to cam is calculated by adjusting the following items from gaap net income attributable to cam     i amortization of deferred taxes on intangible assets associated with the election under section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended section  election and     ii nonoperating income net of taxes nongaap diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing nongaap net income attributable to cam by diluted weighted average shares outstanding the deferred tax assets from the section  election allows for a quarterly reduction of approximately  million in current and future income taxes owed by the company to the extent a payable exists to the extent that the deferred tax asset exceeds net income a federal net operating loss carryforward is created this cash savings and any resulting net operating loss carryforward accrue solely for the benefit of the shareholders of the companys common stock the company believes that adjusting this item from the calculation of the above nongaap items can be a useful measure in allowing investors to see the companys performance nonoperating income is excluded from the above nongaap items as it can distort comparisons between periods as noted above the company believes that measures excluding these items are useful in analyzing operating trends and allowing for more comparability between periods which may be useful to investors the company believes that nongaap net income attributable to cam and nongaap diluted earnings per share are useful measures of performance and may be useful to investors because they provide measures of the companys core business activities adjusting for items that are noncash and costs that may distort comparisons between periods these measures are provided in addition to the companys net income attributable to cam and diluted earnings per share calculated under gaap but are not substitutes for those calculations    table b calamos asset management inc nonoperating income net of redeemable

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
