burns isnt one to savor victory—even if its being the first african american woman to lead a major us corporation and the first female ceo to take the reins from another woman within days of being named chief executive of xerox xrx she was on a plane to europe the mission a day tour to meet with staff outside the us where xerox has almost half its sales and discuss ways to get customers buying again i think the celebration of her announcement ended about  seconds after the email went out says clarke murphy a recruiter at russell reynolds burns  has a war to fight xerox a brand so synonymous with copying that its name long ago became a verb faces a brutal business outlook customers are buying less equipment prices keep dropping managers are curbing paper use for costsaving and environmental reasons while departing ceo anne m mulcahy  pulled the  billionayear copier giant from the brink of bankruptcy and restored profitability her successor has much to do burns will find herself battling competitors with stronger balance sheets and more heft as the industry consolidates the norwalk conn companys sales dropped  in the first quarter to  billion producing a profit of only  million the stock trading at more than  a share in september is now less than half that and yet expectations are high as burns ascends to the ceo post executives inside and outside the company speak of her deep industry knowledge and technical prowess as well as her frankness sharp humor and willingness to take risks for many working mothers its inspiring to see mulcahy a mother of two grown sons step down in favor of a woman who has a yearold daughter and yearold stepson—and was herself raised by a single mother in a new york city housing project this is a basesloaded home run says

running major corporations since then three have left while other black women have run major divisions burns is the first to lead a large public company classic new yorker a mechanical engineer by training burns has a strong understanding of the business and its challenges like mulcahy shes a xerox veteran she came to the company as a summer intern in  joining fulltime a year later after completing her masters degree in engineering at columbia university xerox was drifting at the time having largely ignored the threat posed by japanese copiers and new office printers while failing to get innovative products to market she took on roles of increasing responsibility distinguishing herself as a quick study who could handle multiple tasks at once and wasnt afraid to flag a problem ursula is your classic new yorker says christa carone xeroxs vicepresident for marketing and communications shes known for being very frank reginald l brown jr ceo of consultancy brown technology group says many colleagues saw her as ceo material almost two decades ago brown began working with burns in the late s in xeroxs custom systems division which helped clients switch from standard copier machines to ones that could be integrated with computer networks when burns was appointed special assistant to wayland hicks then president of marketing and customer operations in  everyone knew she was on the fast track these were jobs in the company that division presidents put their best people in says brown most of them were white males so to have an african american female in such a position of power you knew early on she had great potential she later took on a similar role with thenceo paul a allaire appointed general manager in  and vicepresident for worldwide manufacturing two years later burns helped lead a push into color copying but the overall business continued to struggle by the time mulcahy took over as ceo in  xerox was in deep trouble customers had migrated from xeroxs standalone copiers to using cheaper desktop printers to get multiple copies of documents rivals such as canon and hewlettpackard had stolen the lead in key product areas and the company had pulled down almost its entire credit line as the business hemorrhaged money early in mulcahys tenure she forged a partnership with burns over time she entrusted her lieutenant with much of the daytoday operations while she focused on improving customer service and xeroxs financial health mulcahy oversaw major moves such as shedding the desktop printer business while trying to get the balance sheet in shape all the while tichy observes burns was the one who was clearly running the majority of the business with the company in crisis she helped downsize the workforce by close to  to  from  she spearheaded xeroxs move out of manufacturing with flextronics flex now making most of the actual copiers burns who was named president in  also identified some gaps in its offerings filling them with lowerend products from xerox or partners that has given the company its largest product portfolio in history and allowed it to be more competitive in selling to small and midsize businesses and she has proven adept at garnering the support of the board she understands the technology and can communicate it in a way that a director can understand it says pgs mcdonald another factor in burns rise has been the strength and depth of xeroxs commitment to diversity onethird of xeroxs  executives are women and  are minorities employee affinity networks first sprang up in the late s and senior executives have long had responsibility for sponsoring them burns was a liaison to the hispanic employees caucus it was a system that allowed you to be recognized at a time when women and minorities often werent notes nina smith who moved up the ranks at xerox at much the same time as burns eventually becoming chief marketing officer shes now a senior vicepresident at it consultant mitchell international much of what xerox does is now replicated in other companies an executive diversity council leadership programs and performance reviews that rate managers on their ability to recruit mentor and promote underrepresented groups if they dont hit the mark their review pay and chances at promotion get dinged what has distinguished xerox is less the outline of its programs than the actual makeup of its senior ranks as harvard business school professor david a thomas observes you have a culture where having women and people of color as candidates for powerful jobs has been going on for two decades now burns toughest job will be restoring the companys topline growth equipment sales were down  in the first quarter and once fastgrowing developing markets which make up  of sales have slowed to a crawl with demand in countries such as russia off  while analyst richard gardner of citigroup global markets argues that the companys strength in color printing and recent acquisitions should help it rebuild he expects a steep dip in sales this year to  billion xerox says its investment in innovative products will help it emerge from the recession stronger but gartner group says it expects corporate purchases of copiers printers and other hardware to remain flat through  while prices will continue to slide and fitch ratings put xeroxs  billion in bbbrated debt on a negative outlook after the firstquarter numbers came in will they be able to make acquisitions asks fitch analyst nick n nilarp or will they just continue very slow growth if at all in the short term analysts hope burns will focus on reviving sales in emerging markets while continuing to expand into highermargin services at home and xerox needs to be more efficient to compete against aggressive and deeppocketed competitors the most important business stories of the day get bloombergs daily newsletter sign up while burns has much to do to rebuild xeroxs strength shes aware of the significance

remake her firm into the company american business can’t live without but can xerox succeed in a world without xeroxing by fast company stafflong read burns is the first africanamerican woman to lead a us company of xerox’s size and influence  photo by jake chessum makeup by oslyn holder for epiphany agency after eight meetings with the president of the united states ursula burns still wonders what the button is for “these meetings are all very choreographed very much according to protocol” she says “that usually isn’t my thing protocol” she is telling me about her latest encounter a hastily called meeting at the white house this past august during the height of the debtceiling debates to discuss methods for spurring the economy she and seven other ceos among them the heads of american express johnson  johnson us steel and wells fargo were placed like pegs in a tightly designed game board sitting in front of tent cards with their names in a formal script waiting for the president to arrive at the president’s place sat a folio of notes and a small box with a red button burns who had been seated in a position of honor to obama’s right was to be the last to speak as she waited she considered whether the button could be the executive branch equivalent of the gong show gong she thought to herself maybe he pushes it if he doesn’t like what we say advertisementwhen it was her turn burns recalls the president said “‘this has been really good and now i’m bracing for the tough one”’ burns smiles at the recollection she is known to be tough burns is the first africanamerican woman to lead a company the size of xerox coming to power in  during an economic tailspin that continues to threaten the global economy and her company’s bottom line she is the second woman to run the iconic firm in a historic succession that has produced historic results working closely with friend and former ceo anne mulcahy burns was part of a small group of executives who rescued xerox from near bankruptcy in  and began moving the company away from its machinemaking roots and into a different business entirely “the thing i valued most about ursula and why i valued her participation in senior management is that she has the courage to tell you the truth in ugly times” says mulcahy being direct is her calling card when burns talked to obama about leadership and the practical aspects of what big business needs it was serious advice respectfully offered burns isn’t nostalgic she has no desire to dwell on xerox’s former glories instead she is willing to do whatever it takes to reposition her firm for an era of technological upheavalshe did however tell him that he owed her  billion the debtceiling crisis had played havoc with the valuations of many american firms including xerox’s had obama seen its share price lately wasn’t he at least partly responsible “what did i do” burns asked him “all i did was wake up and my share price is down” the remark elicited a laugh from the president who is also by way of the federal government a major xerox customer it was in many ways a signature move burns not a protocol kind of person is always willing to push the button herself“i’m a black lady from the lower east side of new york” ursula burns says “not a lot intimidates me” burns grew up in the projects on delancey street close to all the trouble that a poor kid can get into in a city in decline her mother olga who died in  washed and ironed clothes for money she also knew her way around a deal–she traded cleaning services to a neighborhood doctor in exchange for health care for her three kids ursula the middle child says of her father “he wasn’t in the picture” burns describes her mother as supremely confident and someone who expected great things from her kids “i don’t want to overemphasize this” she says “but not a day goes by when i don’t think about my mother and what she would think about what i just did i often adjust my approach” back in the old neighborhood ursula burns pointing to her childhood home in manhattan  photos by jake chessum in many respects burns’s ascent to the top of xerox–and the decisions she’s been willing to make to ensure the company has a future–carries a business lesson for uncertain times she is by her own admission in love with the company that gave her a livelihood and a year career and yet she isn’t the least bit nostalgic when the conversation turns to returning xerox to its former glories that was then she has long been willing to do whatever it takes–dismantle the company’s manufacturing unit that shaped her career cut back or eliminate products that once defined the xerox brand branch out into uncertain and risky new areas of business–in an effort to reposition the company in an era of technological upheaval what’s more unlike her contemporaries at say hewlettpackard burns’s career turn demonstrates that you don’t need an outsider to save the day an insider can do it just as well–and can bring with her an incomparable institutional knowledge and the deep well of respect of her peers “i came in the wrong way” says mulcahy of her surprise ascent to ceo “as difficult as it was ursula came in the right way”advertisementburns had an early aptitude for math that earned her a scholarship to the polytechnic institute of new york and a degree in mechanical engineering in  she was tapped for a summer engineering internship at xerox and she never fully left the next year she earned a master’s from columbia that xerox helped pay for “i saw what was possible for myself early” she says during a  “caucus”–a type of employee gathering organized around worklife topics–a question was asked about xerox’s diversity initiatives and whether they lowered hiring standards wayland hicks the president of marketing and customer operations weighed in as he politely explained why the company did not lower standards burns pricked up her ears she thought why give the question the dignity of a response she raised her hand “we had a little debate about it in front of the room” she says “why not attack the assertion directly” hicks later coached burns on the finer points of corporate diplomacy but he was impressed by her guts and intelligence not long after hicks tapped her as his executive assistant a job that served as a de facto leadershiptraining program “that was the first sign she was really on the executive track” says mulcahy “it was a significant signal to everyone” by  her outspokenness and keen business insights had gained the attention of thenceo paul allaire who poached her from hicks for a similar position in his office by  she was the vice president for worldwide manufacturing and had led the push into color copying soon there wasn’t a manufacturing job she hadn’t touched or a xerox product she didn’t understandshadowing her from the sales side was mulcahy whom she considers a close friend “our careers grew the same way from different directions” says burns “if she did it i did it next she was always one step ahead of me” both women are xerox lifers both married “xerox husbands” says burns burns’s husband lloyd bean is now a retired xerox scientist as burns puts it “xerox sucks you in and you become part of each other” still by the late s mulcahy and burns were mostly part of a dying company xerox was sputtering in the face of japanese competition at the same time the digital world’s ascendance over xerox’s empire of paper and paper copiers seemed inevitable a new ceo a former ibm’er named g richard thoman was appointed in  he lasted about  months by the time the board asked him to leave the company’s stock had plummeted from a record of nearly  a share in may  to  in may  and xerox was heavily in debt jim firestone currently the president of corporate operations says it simply “we broke the company broke” burns is characteristically direct “we had lost complete faith in the leadership of the company” she says “we didn’t have any cash and few prospects for making any” and that wasn’t the worst part “the one thing you wanted was good and strong leaders that were aligned and could get us through things and we didn’t have that” by  burns was ready to leave but when mulcahy became ceo she helped persuade burns to stay and it then fell to burns to outsource xerox’s manufacturing the move was crucial to xerox’s costsaving efforts if done wrong however it would cripple xerox’s relationship with its customers burns chose the global manufacturer flextronics but to complete the deal she needed the support of the xerox union some  employees in a facility near rochester burns recalls “i told them the truth in as much detail as i could about what was happening” says mulcahy “she literally convinced the union that it was going to be either some jobs or no jobs for anyone it was survival there was no other way” by  xerox had returned to profitability but the company had dropped from  to  employees in less than four years what’s more the bigger issue still remained “what we had to do was step back and think” burns recalls “what is it that xerox really does” what burns remembers most about her first day as the ceo of xerox was dinner the night before over a meal with mulcahy she got the news that she had been hoping for “we were pushing to take the company in a direction that made a lot of sense–on paper” she says the direction she was referring to was the acquisition of affiliated computer services or acs a company that had started as a familyowned dataentry business in the mids and had grown into a  billion services powerhouse with a foot in the door of seemingly every back office around the world if you paid a toll or a parking ticket applied for a credit card or went to the doctor in america sometime in the past year chances are acs worked your paper trail behind the scenes advertisement where does xerox’s revenue come from the enterprise giant takes in nearly  billion a year here’s how by the time burns started courting acs xerox had already taken tentative steps into the business processing sector clearly aware that copiers and faxes were not going to keep them afloat in a digital world the company had started by buying two small firms in –one that streamlined the electronic discovery process for litigation and one for mortgage documentation “we were being dragged by our customers into managing large complex business processes for them” says burns but cobbling together small acquisitions into a bigger business wasn’t going to cut it burns concluded with competitors like ibm targeting some of the same lines of business acquiring acs would double xerox’s size and beef up what the company earned from services to nearly half its annual revenue lynn blodgett ceo of acs had been fielding offers from xerox competitors and privateequity groups but in  he gave burns and mulcahy a formal nod over dinner the final deal announced some  days later was met with skepticism from wall street from that vantage point it seemed like just another detour in xerox’s long road to irrelevance burns tells this story after a long day of presentations at an analyst meeting held at citi field–xerox does the backoffice work for the new york mets–the day after her nd birthday it happened to be some eight months after the acs acquisition the deal was finalized in february  and burns was feeling optimistic her day had been filled with big talk and powerpoint presentations–visions of xeroxacs synergies and workflow diagrams and product demos her essential argument however was this business services was a smart area to work in with dependable income even in bad times by burns’s calculations it was a potential “ billion marketplace” and xerox’s advantages in getting a large slice of that pie lay in its innovative capabilities for four decades the company’s research facility–xerox parc in palo alto–had shown its worth in creating not only the laser printer and ethernet cable but the graphic user interface that steve jobs encountered in late  and discerned to be the future of personal technology in  xerox research was not focused on improving the pc but it was focused on making any process that a business or government needed wildly more efficient sure clients didn’t value copiers quite so much anymore but they hadn’t yet seen how xerox machines had learned to read and understand the documents they scanned–and how work that might take a room full of paralegals toll collectors or mortgage processors a week could now be rendered in minutes or perhaps secondsin a world that’s currently dazzled by social graphs and app releases burns acknowledges that business services can sound decidedly unsexy “these are processes that a company needs to run their business” she explains “they do it as a sideline it’s not their main thing they don’t major in it” her point is that xerox does do it as a main thing anyone at xerox is quick to assert they work just as hard as other big tech companies to change the way the world is wired burns simply believes that the direction she is taking the company will preserve xerox’s legacy as innovators and continue the firm’s growth she has reasons to believe this some of them relate to xerox parc’s work some reside within a chateau that houses the xerox research centre europe near grenoble in the french alps burns sent me on a pilgrimage there–she did the same for acs’s blodgett when the two began talking about merging–because it is the best way for her to make the case that while xerox was struggling to stay relevant between  and  it was doing a ton of stuff right toothe center was founded in  to help xerox prepare for a future when its technology products printers and paper copiers became a commodity and when business services to help xerox customers work faster and cheaper would be the way forward “we were a document company at the beginning and it was very important to figure out how we could extract what was in the documents to automate certain things” says monica beltrametti a phd in theoretical physics and the founding director of the center advertisementunder beltrametti’s watch xerox machines have increasingly learned to understand languages analyze photos and route data in a fraction of the time that it takes errorprone humans a machine in the lab that resembles a light table appears to effortlessly recognize each of the photos in a digital album and sorts the images into proper “piles” based on location person and activity the same table then correctly sorts information within dense legal documents as part of litigation research the data can be compiled emailed and routed in virtually any way imaginable for a data guy like acs’s blodgett it was love at first sight “i was already happy with our technology” he says “but this was going to make an immediate difference to us” when blodgett and beltrametti talked about ezpass the automatedtollcollection technology that acs oversees it became even more obvious as blodgett explains ezpass transponders–those plastic rectangular blocks–can often get lost or broken when he asked beltrametti if xerox had a machine that could read a license plate–thus eliminating the transponder entirely–she told him yes and then upped the ante “‘would it help you if it could read the registration as well or if the license plate was held on by wire instead of a bolt”–a sign that the car might be stolen blodgett was impressed “i told her yes it would it would help me a lot”already the marriage has shown results a new xerox device–a compact computer with scanning printing and internet capabilities–has been deployed to acs insurance clients for use in the field instead of being mailed claims and related data are scanned onsite sorted routed and put immediately into a workflow system error rates have plummeted along with processing time that idea and others in the pipeline came from “customer dreaming sessions” which blodgett has been coordinating at parc in palo alto and other xerox research centers essentially he is bringing his humdrum customers–procurement managers payroll officers and municipal officials–to meet his new cool genius friends stephen hoover ceo of xerox parc paints a utopian picture at a roundtable meeting at parc with his boss burns at his right hand to hoover parc can already make acs more efficient but soon it can make acs smarter too “it’s not just processing medicaid payments” he says “it’s using our social cognition research to add wellness support that helps people better manage conditions like diabetes” or it involves analyzing patterns and applying the results to say the realtime parking and traffic data that acs collects for municipal customers hoover ticks through a list road sensors that help you find a parking spot or ticket you when you go too fast parking meters that call  and take photos when a button is pushed some of these technologies are already in beta in cities such as san francisco and new orleans “look” burns chimes in “not everything that happens here makes it to the marketplace but parc now has a model that allows them to dream beyond the boundaries of what xerox can use” hoover appears to be holding his breath as she continues “what happens now is the ability to apply some of that dreaming that was done for other clients”one of the most interesting things about becoming a ceo is that the very thing you did to get there is usually not the thing you need to do to keep you there burns still doles out radical honesty when needed but there’s now an overlay of zen that seems to surprise even her she has become a listenerinchief she claims and she has learned to temper her outspokenness–with the help of some good coaching she admits from her business associates xerox’s parc research center has already developed a host of technologies to transform the service industry–parking meters that can call  and road sensors that ticket you if you go too fastshe is philosophical about her company’s transition from tech titan to backoffice big brother the first xerographic machine the  was a miracle of technology and made its debut in the ballroom of new york’s sherrynetherland hotel today few people notice whether the machines in the corner copy room are from xerox ricoh canon or hp fewer still know that the company that brought printing to the masses is now working behind the scenes digitizing the paper it once pushed it’s a massive identity shift that burns seems to have fully embraced “look it’s cool to be google” she says “but even google has to close their books and pay their people” the work isn’t glamorous even for companies who specialize in it nor is it easy xerox has been battered by a weak global economy and supply interruptions due to the japanese earthquake and its stock price has hovered in the single digits for the past year yet as contrarian strategies go there are some reasons to be cautiously optimistic as of now xerox has close to  billion in cash on hand a far cry from the neardeath experience of a decade ago and almost half of its annual revenue derives from services giving the company a nicely diversified revenue stream “we see now that the acs acquisition was probably a very forward looking prudent move” says deepak sitaraman a credit suisse analyst he adds that xerox appears to be on track for  growth next yearburns too has come a long way from the lower east side she may enjoy the occasional jab at the president but she clearly admires him and like obama her accomplishments have earned her an access that she could never have imagined in addition to her work on economics she was tapped in  to be on the white house committee on science technology engineering and math education stem with former intel ceo craig barrett and former astronaut sally ride she works a plea for stem education into every speech when i ask if all the time she has spent in washington might tempt her into the public sector she laughs then rolls her eyes “things move too slowly in government” instead she talks about her old neighborhood and jokes that she can’t afford to live there anymore “but there are plenty of neighborhoods just like it all around the country” she says “i see kids out there nowhere to go nothing good waiting for them any one of them could have been my son” she stops to think “or me” advertisementrelated storiesleadershipsix words and phrases that make everyone hate working with youleadershipfour worklife questions to
