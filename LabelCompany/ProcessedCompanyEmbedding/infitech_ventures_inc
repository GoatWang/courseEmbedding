business opportunities all of the companys assets are held in canada     all amounts are stated in united states dollars unless otherwise noted      going concern     these financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america with the ongoing assumption that the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business however certain conditions noted below currently exist which raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern     the operations of the company have primarily been funded by the issuance of common stock and funding from related parties continued operations of the company are dependent on the companys ability to complete equity financings or generate profitable operations in the future managements plan in this regard is to secure additional funds through future equity sales such sales may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms     there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to raise funds in which case the company may be unable to meet its obligations should the company be unable to realize economic benefit from its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business the net realizable value of assets may be materially less than the amounts recorded on the balance sheets these financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern     the current market conditions and volatility increase the uncertainty of the companys ability to continue as a going concern given the need to both curtail expenditures and to raise additional funds the company is experiencing and has experienced negative operating cash flows the company will continue to search for new or alternate sources of financing but anticipates that the current market conditions may impact the ability to source such funds      significant accounting policies     the significant accounting policies adopted by the company are

company bases its evaluation on such impairment indicators as the nature of the assets the future economic benefit of the assets any historical or future profitability measurements as well as other external market conditions or factors that may be present in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset an impairment loss will be recognized     contributed executive services     the company is required to report all costs of

three and nine months ended april   and changes in our financial condition from july   this discussion should be read in conjunction with the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended july   filed with the sec on october   overview we were incorporated on october   under the laws of the state of nevada for the purpose of seeking business opportunities with respect to environmental technologies and products our business revolves around the development and marketing of a proprietary technology the wax technology that uses a molten wax compound consisting of paraffin wax and resins to control clean and remediate oil and other liquid fuel spills on land and water in addition as part of our longterm business plan we intend to pursue business opportunities in wastewater treatment solutions we continue to require additional financing if we are to continue as a going concern and to finance our business operations as of april   we had cash on hand of  if we are not able to acquire sufficient financing in the near future our business could fail and investors could

three months ended april   because of an increase in foreign exchange loss the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by decreases in office expenses and professional fees our operating expenses increased during the nine months ended april   our operating expenses increased because we recorded foreign exchange loss as compared to a foreign exchange gain during the previous period the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by decreases in office expenses and professional fees we are required to report all costs of conducting our business as such we have recorded as an expense the fair market value of contributed executive services provided to us at no cost we recorded contributed executive services of  per month these services are provided to us at no charge and a corresponding increase in additional paidin capital has been recorded if we are able to obtain sufficient financing to proceed with our plan of operation of which there is no assurance we expect that

          our only sources of financing for the nine month period ended april   was an increase in amounts due to related parties our plan of operation calls for us to spend significantly more than our current capital resources or the amount of financing that we have been able to obtain to date as such there is a substantial doubt that we will be able to raise significant financing to complete our stated plan of operation any substantial financing that we are able to obtain is expected to be in the form of equity financing to date we have relied on short term loans from our sole executive officer and director and private placement sales of our equity securities in order to finance our ongoing activities and to meet our outstanding financial obligations there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain financing from these sources in the future our sole executive officer and director could refuse to provide us with any additional financing and we may not be able to find suitable investors willing to purchase our equity securities if we are unable to obtain financing our business could fail and shareholders could lose some or all of their investment during the nine months ended april   we received loans of  and cad  from paul g daly our sole director and executive officer on may   we received loans of usd  and cad  from paul g daly all of the loans are unsecured noninterest bearing and due on demand the form of promissory note used for the loans is attached as exhibit  to this current report on form q offbalance sheet arrangements we have no

applicable item                 controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by exchange act rules ae and de as of january   evaluation date based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the evaluation date as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed in our annual report on form k for the year ended july   the  annual report notwithstanding the assessment that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in our  annual report we believe that our financial statements contained in our quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended april   report fairly present our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in all material respects changes in internal controls there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended april   that have materially affected or that are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting part ii

a             risk factors the following are some of the important factors that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in our forwardlooking statements we may encounter risks in addition to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also impair or adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operation need for financing we do not currently have the financial resources to complete our plan of operation for the next twelve months we anticipate that we will require financing in the amount of  in order to fund our plan of operation over the next twelve months we presently do not have any sufficient financing arrangements in place and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if further financing is not available our ability to meet our financial obligations and pursue our plan of operation will be substantially limited if we are not able to meet our financial obligations as they come due our business could fail and investors could lose a substantial portion or all of their investment  limited operating history risks of a new business venture we were incorporated on october   and prior to our acquisition of the wax technology we had been involved primarily in organizational activities and in seeking business opportunities related to environmental technologies and products we have not earned any revenues to date potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by a new enterprise and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the potential for future success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the development of a business in the area in which we intend to operate and in connection with the formation and commencement of operations of a new business in general these include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to research and development programs marketing approvals by government agencies competition and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that our business will prove successful and there can be no assurance that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations our operations will be subject to extensive government regulations our operations will be subject to extensive government regulations in the united states canada and in other countries in which we may operate in order to sell our anticipated products we may be required to obtain a number of regulatory approvals at the federal state and local level including the approval of the us environmental protection agency and environment canada we may incur material costs or liabilities in obtaining such approvals andor complying with applicable laws and regulations furthermore our potential customers may be required to comply with numerous laws and regulations when engaging in environmental remediation activities there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully comply with all present or future government regulations an inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or the imposition of onerous conditions on the use of our anticipated products will have a materially adverse effect on us our business and our financial condition our business operations assets and personnel are located outside the united states although we are incorporated in the united states all of our current operating activities are conducted in and all of our assets and personnel are located in canada as such investors in our securities may experience difficulty in enforcing judgments or liabilities against the company or our personnel under united states securities laws as a nevada corporation we are subject to the laws of the united states including the federal securities laws of the united states and to the jurisdiction of united states courts as such investors may bring proceedings against us and enforce judgments obtained against us in united states courts generally original actions to enforce liabilities under united states federal securities laws may not be brought in a canadian court such actions must be brought in a court in the united states with applicable jurisdiction persons obtaining judgments against us in united states courts including judgments obtained under united states federal securities laws will then be required to bring an application in a canadian court to enforce such judgments in canada competition is intense and we may be unable to achieve market acceptance the business environment in which we intend to operate is highly competitive currently there exist a number of established methods products and technologies used to control clean and remediate oil spills and we expect to experience competition from a number of established companies involved in the environmental remediation industry certain of our potential competitors will have greater technical financial marketing sales and other resources than us  in addition while the environmental remediation industry is a mature one there is no established market for products utilizing our wax technology we are unable to provide assurances that our target customers and markets will accept our technologies or will purchase our products and services in sufficient quantities to achieve profitability if a significant market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate we may be unable to recover the losses incurred to develop products and we may be unable to meet our operational expenses acceptance of our anticipated products by environmental remediation firms and other organizations will depend upon a number of factors including the cost competitiveness of our products customer reluctance to try new products or services regulatory requirements or the emergence of more competitive or effective products asserting and defending intellectual property rights may impact the results of our operations we had applied for a patent from the cipo however we did not receive a final grant of patent from the cipo and we have decided to abandon our patent application at this time as patent applications are publicly available documents competitors may be able to copy the formulations set out in our patent application due to our limited financial resources we do not expect to apply for patent protection for any new developments that we make to the wax technology as a result in order to protect future developments we will need to maintain the secrecy of our formulations and the methods we use if we are unable to maintain the secrecy of those developments then competitors may be able to copy our formulations and methodology which would have a material adverse effect on our business dependence on key personnel our success will largely depend on the performance of our directors and officers and our key consultants our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical research management regulatory compliance sales and marketing personnel competition for such personnel is intense the loss of the services of such personnel or the inability to attract and retain other key personnel could impair the development of our business operating results and financial condition our stock is a penny stock because our stock is a penny stock shareholders will be more limited in their ability to sell their stock the sec has adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation system because our securities constitute penny stocks within the meaning of the rules the rules apply to us and to our securities the rules may further affect the ability of owners of shares to sell our securities in any market that might develop for them as long as the trading price of our common stock is less than  per share the common stock will be subject to rule g under the exchange act the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the sec that  contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading      contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of securities laws      contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including

sec shall require by rule or regulation the brokerdealer also must provide prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock the customer with a bid and offer quotations for the penny stock b the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction c the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock and d a monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and a signed and dated copy of a written

are expressed in us dollars unless otherwise indicated   item  business general we were incorporated on october   under the laws of the state of nevada for the purpose of seeking business opportunities with respect to environmental technologies and products our business revolves around the development and marketing of a proprietary technology the “wax technology” that uses a molten wax compound consisting of paraffin wax and resins to control clean and remediate oil and other liquid fuel spills on land and water in addition as part of our longterm business plan we intend to pursue business opportunities in wastewater treatment solutions we continue to require additional financing if we are to continue as a going concern and to finance our business operations as of july   we had cash of  if we are not able to acquire sufficient financing in the near future our business could fail and investors could lose their investment the wax technology the wax technology utilizes a wax compound made up of a proprietary mixture of paraffin wax and synthetic resins to control and clean oil spills on land still bodies of water and shorelines the wax compound is heated to a liquid state and the molten wax compound is then sprayed on top of the oil spill in a manner similar to spray painting a car once the wax compound comes into contact with the oil spill whether the spill is on water or the ground the wax instantaneously solidifies a chemical reaction occurs as the hydrocarbon molecules present in the oil spill automatically bond with the hydrocarbon molecules present in the wax the result is a solidified mixture that floats and which can then be easily collected the collected waxoil mixture can then be reprocessed recycled by separating the oil from the wax and reused the wax technology is designed for easy use by any laborer significantly reduces the costs and dangers associated with existing remediation methods and cleans to existing environmental standards previous formulations of the wax technology utilized high grade petroleum based waxes blended with polyethylene however due to high petroleum prices our management has decided to focus on lower cost lower melt point waxes at this time product development and planned wax applications currently we intend to market different formulations of the wax technology for use on   a large and small still water shoreline and inland water oil spills b large and small inland oil spills      c industrialcommercial factory oil spills and d consumer inland oil spills our product development work to date has focused primarily on adjusting the formulation of the wax itself choosing waxes of different melt points for specific applications and experimenting with waxes with different melt points and with different methods of application when conducting our development work consideration is given to      expected weather conditions and season of the year    type of oil spilled eg bunker diesel gasoline etc    whether the spill is on land or water    method to be used to retrieve the spent solid waxoil mixture    nature of the terrain eg sandy beach vs rocky shoreline and    application method and equipment by varying the formulation of wax and synthetic resins and the melting point of the wax we are able to vary the structural strength of the wax its rigidity its elasticity and its adhesive qualities our tests have shown that paraffin waxes with a midrange melt point and a higher ratio of resins to wax are better suited for treating oil coated beaches during summer climate conditions the mixture is heated in a container to °f and sprayed onto the oil using a flarejet nozzle  inches above the sand surface gravity feed is all that is required for this application the resin speeds up the setting process and helps render the waxoil residual less sticky to handle and prevents clogging in the application equipment when treating oil spills on still water such as lakes ponds or tide pools paraffin waxes having a lower range melt point and with a lower ratio of resins to wax provide better results this wax formulation works well when used in conjunction with a synthetic mesh netting used to retrieve the waxoil residual a flood nozzle with a gravity feed would be used to apply this wax formulation when spraying cliffs or rocks a formulation has been developed to minimize the adhesive quality of the wax this allows the solidifying wax to flow down the face of the cliff and collect at the base increasing the efficiency of collecting the waxoil residual this hot wax formulation would be sprayed on the rocks using a flare jet nozzle of  to  psi of pressure heavier oils such as bunker b or bunker c oil require higher pressure application to penetrate the thick viscous oil layer regardless of whether the oil is spilled on land or water our tests have shown that a midrange melt point wax with a low ratio of resins to wax to be more effective in cleaning up this type of oil this wax formulation can then be applied at increased pressures depending on the depth and viscosity of the oil layer and the ambient temperature prototype and field testing prototypes of the wax technology have been field tested in a handful of cases in  an oil spill occurred around the shores of the ecologically sensitive passage island located at the entrance to howe sound off the coast of british columbia canada the spilled oil occupied an area measuring approximately  feet long by  feet wide environment canada commissioned the wax technology’s inventor william nelson to clean the shoreline of passage island using an early prototype of the wax technology the prototype wax formulation was sprayed on the contaminated area under low tide conditions and all residual oil was removed within three days using a crew of three men environment canada inspected the shoreline area after the clean up with a team of marine biologists who verified that all oil and residual wax had been removed from the area the cleanup was conducted over a three day period with a crew of three men working  hours per day the equipment used consisted of x gallon steel drums used to heat and store the wax and three small spray containers for dispensing the wax onto the oil spill the oil spill was contained and removed from the shoreline using approximately  pounds of wax the total cost of the clean up was approximately  in conducting the clean up at passage island the following deficiencies were identified and addressed         it was observed that when applying the wax to rocks with uneven or rough surfaces not all of the oil was removed as a result the wax is now applied under pressure in order to dislodge oil located in pockets and rock crevices          it was observed that when applying the wax to oil resting in tidal areas in some cases the wax was not fully congealed prior to the tide coming back in we addressed this issue by adding various resins to the wax compound which has reduced the solidification time in  mr nelson conducted a demonstration of an early prototype of the wax technology for the us coast guard the demonstration was conducted on the actual capeche oil spill which was caused by a crude oil pipe fracture the demonstration was conducted in an area measuring approximately  feet long by  feet wide and removed all of the oil spilled in this area the spill was on both water and land and was cleaned up by two men using approximately  gallons of wax the oil was completely removed from the spill area within one hour the heated wax was applied by using a steel pail to contain the wax which was then poured over the spilled oil the total cost of the clean up was approximately  in  mr nelson conducted another demonstration of a prototype of the wax technology for the us coast guard in honolulu hawaii the wax technology was tested on a tidal waters area containing sand rocks and water and measuring approximately  feet long by  feet wide mr nelson was able to remove all of the oil from this area using the wax technology prototype the oil spill was contained and removed within one hour by mr nelson and an assistant from the us coast guard using three gallons of the wax technology prototype the total cost of the field trial including preparation time was approximately  demonstrations of the wax technology were conducted for ontario hydro in    and  the tests were conducted on both land and inland waters on no  fuel oil turbine oil lubricating oil thermal oil transformer oil crude oil bunker oil diesel fuel and gasoline the demonstrations were conducted at the lennox tgs in bath ontario canada one of these demonstrations was used to clean up an actual oil spill over a land area measuring approximately  feet by  feet the prototype wax formulation was successfully used to clean this area as well as machinery and staircases affected by the oil spill this oil spill was cleaned up over a four hour period by two men using approximately  gallons of the wax technology at a cost of approximately  other demonstrations were typically conducted by mr nelson on areas measuring  feet by  feet over a one hour period using approximately one gallon of the wax technology each trial cost approximately  in  mr nelson conducted a demonstration of the wax technology in the toronto harbour for the toronto harbour commission and the canadian coast guard a mixture of diesel fuel and crude oil was spilled into a cordoned area of the harbour measuring approximately  feet by  feet two men using approximately five gallons of the prototype wax formulation removed the spilled oil within one hour at a cost of approximately  the wax compound was contained in a  gallon steel drum that was then heated using a propane torch the heated wax was then poured over the spilled oil which was then completely entrained in the wax and completely removed upon solidification in may of  we engaged bodycote materials testing canada inc “bodycote” an independent testing facility to examine the effectiveness of the wax technology in the bodycote experiment a one centimeter thick layer of crude oil was poured on top of water lying in a large bath container with a surface area of approximately  square feet the hot wax compound was then poured onto the oil surface until the entire surface area had been covered according to bodycote’s results the molten wax compound absorbed approximately  of its own weight in crude oil as the layer of spilled oil was relatively thin pouring the wax compound over the spilled oil was sufficient to encapsulate the oil through the water surface if the layer of oil had been two to three inches thick the wax compound would have been sprayed under pressure in order to penetrate the oil surface to the oilwater interface competition there are a number of existing and established technologies and techniques currently being used to clean oil spills and with which our wax technology would compete some of the techniques currently used in the industry include      a mechanical recovery and containment  mechanical recovery and containment techniques utilize floating booms to contain oil spills on water these booms must be towed by boats or other vessels in an effort to contain the spilled oil the oil is then collected by skimmers which remove oil and water from the surface or by vacuum hoses which suck the oil and water from the surface the major limitation of mechanical containment techniques is that they require the coordination of a number of boats and vessels in order to surround and contain the oil spill which will naturally tend to disperse under the influence of waves and currents generally the use of mechanical containment techniques will require extensive logistical support further because the booms must be towed by boats the ability to use booms in shallow inshore waters is limited in addition as the oil weathers and changes viscosity the pumps and skimmers being used may need to be changed increasing the costs and time of recovery finally once the oil recovery is completed the booms skimmers and vacuums must be cleaned overhauled and repaired for use on the next oil spill     b chemical dispersants  dispersion of an oil spill will naturally occur when waves and other turbulence at the water surface causes the oil to break into tiny droplets and disperse into the surrounding water chemical solvents in applied dispersants are used to accelerate this process of physical and chemical break down the dispersants are usually sprayed onto the oil spill using boats or airplanes the primary disadvantage of chemical dispersants is that they involve the deliberate introduction into the environment of additional chemical pollutants in open sea waters the dispersal rate of the chemicals is relatively high and concentrations of the chemicals after introduction are unlikely to be high enough to produce adverse effects however on stillcalm waters and in shallow shore waters where water exchange is poor higher concentrations may persist for long periods and may themselves present environmental dangers     c in situ burning  in situ burning involves intentionally setting the oil spill ablaze in order to burn the oil off the surface customarily in situ burning on water involves corralling the oil using booms and setting it ablaze using flares explosives or lasers the oil fire then burns until the fuel runs out or conditions favorable to combustion change burning can pose a number of logistical problems in addition to the obvious safety concern associated with a large oil fire ignition of the oil can be problematic depending upon the amount of dispersal which has occurred and the type of oil spilled in order to maintain the oil burn the layer of oil on the surface generally needs to be at least two to three millimeters thick as a result of naturally occurring dispersion booms will often need to be used in order to concentrate the oil in addition as the more combustible elements of the oil burn off the cooling effects of the wind and sea may eventually extinguish the fire leaving a significant quantity of oil unburned vast quantities of smoke can also be produced by in situ burning threatening nearby populations if it rains during the burning the smoke can result in oily rain falling as far as  kilometers away finally burning can leave a viscous toxic residue which may sink or otherwise be difficult to recover     d sorbentstissues  sorbents or tissues may be used to wipe absorb or adsorb the oil from the surface of the water or from the land a variety of natural or synthetic materials may be used as absorbing agents each of these materials has a number of advantages and disadvantages generally the size of the crews required to apply traditional sorbents grows exponentially with the size of the oil spill also spent sorbents do not continue to collect much oil and must be disposed of or incinerated at special hazardous materials sites based on our prototype tests and on field tests of the wax technology conducted by mr nelson we believe that our wax technology will provide distinct advantages over existing techniques and technologies such as      the supply costs for the paraffin wax which forms the main ingredient of our wax technology are relatively low when compared to the cost of materials and equipment required for existing mechanical techniques and chemical dispersants          application of our wax technology will not depend on water turbulence or water exchange to facilitate clean up of the spilled oil         the solidified wax compound which remains after application of the wax technology floats facilitating easy removal of the residual from calmstill waters          because the heated wax compound is applied in liquid form the mobility of the wax allows it to seep into crevices between rocks and machinery unlike competing sorbent products          removal of the solidified wax will not require the use of skimmers or vacuums allowing for easier clean up and postapplication removal than existing mechanical techniques          our wax technology does not involve the lingering introduction of residual chemicals into the environment          the spent wax compound can be collected and recycled for use without incineration or other hazardous disposal and          field tests conducted by mr nelson have demonstrated that the wax can be applied by a relatively small team of technicians utilizing mobile spray application equipment although we have used prototype formulations of our wax technology in a number of test cases we have not yet completed commercial development of products based on that technology and those prototypes have only been used in a small number of situations further because our product is relatively novel the wax technology has not yet gained acceptance in the market place ultimately the ability of products based on our wax technology to successfully compete on a commercial level with existing remediation techniques will depend on our ability to establish a competitive price for our products and on our ability to demonstrate the efficiency and ease of use of our products and most importantly their effectiveness in cleaning oil spills compared to existing techniques current development hurdles our wax technology is likely to be most effective when applied to oil spills located on still water shoreline and coastal waters as well as on land even though the wax compound used in the wax technology will float because deep sea waters tend to be more turbulent than coastal and inland waters collection of the spent wax compound will be more difficult in addition turbulent waters will tend to cause the spilled oil to disperse more quickly which would require the wax compound to be applied over potentially very large areas currently we are still testing various formulations of our wax technology depending upon the different formulations of paraffin wax and synthetic resins the effectiveness of the wax compound on cleaning different types of spilled oilfuels will vary we hope to finalize our different formulations within the next  months subject to our obtaining sufficient financing of which there is no assurance see “management’s discussion and analysis or plan of operation” below in addition to finalizing the different formulations of the wax technology that we intend to market we are currently working to address the following engineeringsafety related issues   a liquefying the wax compound  we are currently working to solve logistical issues related to heating the wax compound from a solid to liquid state and for maintaining the wax in a liquid state different logistical problems present themselves when attempting to use the wax compound in a large scale environment eg shoreline clean ups or small scale environment eg industrial or individual consumer use in order to use the wax compound in a large scale environment large but mobile heating units must be used to keep the wax in a liquid state for consumer use a method must be devised for consumers to safely and effectively heat the wax compound       we are currently working with our wax supplier the international group inc “igi” to utilize tanker trucks to ship the liquefied wax to potential oil spill sites the tankers would be insulated units capable of maintaining the wax in a heated liquid state for extended periods of time we are also in the preliminary stages of developing a mobile application unit for large scale spills complete with propane heaters air compressors tanks hoses temperature controls and applicator nozzles the unit is being designed to be either self propelled or towed by an all terrain vehicle or tractor        in addition for smaller industrial site spills and consumer spills we are working on design prototypes of insulated wax canisters complete with heat controls and dispensing equipment as designed the canisters could be replenished with refill wax cartridges     b applying the wax compound  we are currently working to design new equipment or reconfigure existing technologies to be used to apply the wax in a timely manner effective remediation of oil spills requires the timely application of remediation technologies to use the technology on large oil spills we must ensure that the applicator equipment is mobile to ensure a speedy response we are currently working to develop different types of applicators for use on different types of oil spills see above     c recovery of wax compound  we are currently working on methods to improve the efficiency of collecting the spent wax compound one of the methods that we have developed is the use of a synthetic mesh netting which can be laid down on both land and water prior to application of the wax once the applied wax solidifies the oil wax and netting can be removed in one clean sweep previous formulations for our wax technology utilized a high grade petroleum based wax blended with polyethylene due to sharp increases in petroleum prices our management believes that using high grade petroleum based waxes is no longer cost effective as a result we are focusing on the use and development of lower melt point waxes which at present are more cost effective in addition to the above technical development issues before we are able to market our product we will need to secure a supplier for our wax compound see “manufacturing and production” below further we may be required to obtain the approval of various regulatory agencies see “government regulations” below manufacturing and production once we have completed the development of our anticipated products we plan to market those products directly to emergency response contractors insurance companies and other emergency response organizations involved in the clean up and remediation of oil spills although we have developed and successfully tested prototypes of our wax technology we are in the process of developing and refining various formulations and have not completed the development of our products for commercial application nor have we received any revenues to date in the past we have worked with the international group inc “igi” an unrelated independent supplier of paraffin wax to refine our formulation for various applications mr nelson has collaborated with igi for a number of years on different wax related projects based on mr nelson’s longstanding personal relationship with igi they have verbally agreed to assist us and to provide us with limited supplies of paraffin wax formulated according to mr nelson’s specifications during the prototype refinement process free of charge igi has also verbally agreed to provide us with bench scale quantities of paraffin wax and quantities for small field trials free of charge while we are still in the development stage of our business although igi has verbally agreed to provide us with small amounts of paraffin wax during the development stage of our business we do not have a formal agreement with igi as such igi may at their discretion cease to supply us with paraffin wax once we have completed the development of our commercial products we intend to enter into a formal agreement with igi for the manufacture and supply of our wax compound there are a number of suppliers who provide paraffin wax in raw form however there are a limited number of suppliers willing and able to supply specialized wax composites we have not yet entered into a formal agreement with igi for the manufacture and supply of wax products and there is no assurance that we will be able to reach such an agreement with them in the future if we are unable to reach an agreement with igi for the manufacture and supply of our products we will have to seek alternative suppliers which may have a materially adverse effect on our business    we also intend to produce “minikits” of our wax products to be used by consumers the kits would be targeted to allow everyday consumers to use our products to clean minor oil spills we hope to introduce these kits as part of our product introduction strategy and intend to sell them directly to consumers either online or by telephone we would also provide consumers with aftersales services and support marketing and sales plan we have not yet completed the development of our products for commercial application and have not received any revenues or completed any sales of our products to date once we have completed the refinement and development of our products for commercial sale we expect to focus our marketing and sales efforts on markets within the united states and canada especially in industrialized areas vulnerable to and with a history of spill occurrences we expect to concentrate our marketing and sales efforts directly at approved emergency response contractors insurance companies and other organizations involved in the control and remediation of oil spills we also intend to license our products to global sales agents who will assist us in marketing our products worldwide wastewater treatment products in addition to pursuing the development and marketing of the wax technology as part of our longterm business plan we are also exploring opportunities in wastewater treatment solutions we intend to provide process design solutions and to supply equipment for ultraviolet disinfection membrane filtration and sequencing batch reactor wastewater treatment systems although we will explore opportunities in this area if they present themselves because of our limited financial resources we do not expect to actively pursue opportunities in this area in the near term as we intend to focus our available resources on developing and marketing the wax technology through paul g daly our founder sole director and our chief executive officer chief financial officer president secretary and treasurer we have over  years of experience in providing environmental and wastewater solutions it is expected that mr daly’s experience will form the foundation of this planned business in addition to our plans to provide process design services we intend to seek opportunities to   a obtain exclusive rights to supply proprietary ultraviolet disinfection membrane filtration and sequencing batch reactor equipment or     b obtain rights to act as suppliers for manufacturers of such equipment currently we do not have any contracts to act as a dealer for manufacturers of ultraviolet disinfection membrane filtration or sequencing batch reactor equipment and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such contracts in the future patents and trademarks the inventor of the wax technology mr nelson registered a patent application with the canadian intellectual property office the “cipo” under the application number ca  on july   in march  we received notice of the first examination report from the cipo in connection with our patent application the cipo raised a number of objections to our patent application regarding the wording of our claims which were considered to be indefinite or ambiguous in order to avoid abandonment of our patent application we were required to file a reply to the first examination report by august   due to a lack of financing we were unable to file a reply within the required time period as a result our patent application was abandoned due to our limited financial resources and the high expected cost of reviving this patent application we do not intend revive this patent application in addition during the past year the price of petroleum has increased significantly increasing the cost of the high grade petroleum based waxes called for in the formulation set out in this patent application as a result in the opinion of our management this current formulation would no longer be cost effective we are currently focusing on the development of lower melt point waxes which are less expensive we do not currently have plans to file a patent application for any new developments that we make in the use of waxes for oil spill remediation and we will need to protect our interests by maintaining the secrecy of any new formulations that we develop    government regulations because our wax technology is a chemically inert product and does not involve the lingering introduction of residual chemicals into the environment we believe that it will be unnecessary for us to obtain prior approval from canadian and us environmental regulatory agencies to use our planned products to clean oil spills on land however we may be required to obtain the prior approval of federal regulatory agencies such as environment canada and the us environmental protection agency the “epa” or state or local agencies before our planned products can be used to treat oil spills on inland or coastal waters we may incur material costs or liabilities in obtaining such approvals andor complying with applicable laws and regulations furthermore our potential customers may be required to comply with numerous laws and regulations when engaging in environmental remediation activities we do not anticipate any material costs associated with complying with local state or federal environmental laws in the production of our anticipated products as we intend to contract out the manufacturing of our anticipated wax products environment canada approval requirements in canada where an oil spill will potentially affect inland or coastal waters subject to the canadian fisheries act permission must be obtained from the regional office of environment canada to use oil spill treatment agents or products permission is granted by environment canada on a casebycase basis but is not required for oil spills not affecting waters subject to the fisheries act in order for remediation personnel to obtain permission to use our planned products those products must be submitted to the environmental technology centre of environment canada the “etc” for testing and approval although we have not yet submitted our products to the etc for testing we have made initial contact with the etc with respect to obtaining their approval for our planned products in our discussions with the etc they have expressed concerns with regards to the use of the wax technology on fast moving waters the wax technology’s absorption rate and on the recoverability of the spent wax however the etc’s comments are based on a twentyyear old early prototype of the wax technology that mr nelson had demonstrated for environment canada in the ’s we are working to address those concerns in our current development activities including increasing the absorption capacity of the wax compound and the use of a synthetic mesh netting to remove the spent solidified wax see “product development and planned wax applications” and “current development hurdles” above further we intend to restrict marketing for the use of our product to calmstill waters and shoreline clean ups where we believe use of the wax technology will be most beneficial subject to our ability to obtain additional financing of which there is no assurance once we have completed the development of our planned products we hope to make a formal submission to the etc for their approval us environmental protection agency approval requirements in the united states federal authorization is required to use a product on a specific oil spill incident only where the oil spill has the potential to affect us navigable waters as defined by section  of the national oil and hazardous substances pollution contingency plan “ncp” regulations where the oil spill does not have the potential to affect us navigable waters federal authorization is not required although individual state and local governments may impose their own authorization requirements where an oil spill does have the potential to affect us navigable waters a regional response team “rrt” consisting of representatives of a number of federal and state agencies including a representative of the epa will have jurisdiction over the clean up of the oil spill if the product to be used in the clean up of the oil spill is a chemical or biological agent as defined by section  of the ncp regulations the product must be listed on the ncp product schedule and incident specific rrt member approval is required to use the product the epa is responsible for determining whether a product must be listed on the ncp product schedule because our wax technology is a chemically inert product used to remove the spilled oil we believe that our planned products will be classified as a sorbent under the ncp regulations and will not require listing on the ncp product schedule and will thus not require approval prior to their use on specific spill incidents however in order to confirm the status of our planned products once we have completed the development of our products and subject to our obtaining additional financing of which there is no assurance we intend to submit our products to the epa to confirm that those products meet the definition of a sorbent under the ncp regulations    employees we currently have only one fulltime employee who is our founder sole director

fail and investors could lose a substantial portion or all of their investment limited operating history risks of a new business venture we were incorporated on october   and prior to our acquisition of the wax technology we had been involved primarily in organizational activities and in seeking business opportunities related to environmental technologies and products we have not earned any

to achieve market acceptance the business environment in which we intend to operate is highly competitive currently there exist a number of established methods products and technologies used to control clean and remediate oil spills and we expect to experience competition from a number of established companies involved in the environmental remediation industry certain of our potential competitors will have greater technical financial marketing sales and other resources than us in addition while the environmental remediation industry is a mature one there is no established market for products utilizing our wax technology we are unable to provide assurances that our target customers and markets will accept our technologies or will purchase our products and services in sufficient quantities to achieve profitability if a significant market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate we may be unable to recover the losses incurred to develop products and we may be unable to meet our operational expenses acceptance of our anticipated products by environmental remediation firms and other organizations will depend upon a number of factors including the cost competitiveness of our products customer reluctance to try new products or services regulatory requirements or the emergence of more competitive or effective products asserting and defending intellectual property rights may impact the results of our operations we had applied for a patent from the cipo however we did not receive a final grant of patent from the cipo and we have decided to abandon our patent application at this time as patent applications are publicly available documents competitors may be able to copy the formulations set out in our patent application due to our limited financial resources we do not expect to apply for patent protection for any new developments that we make to the wax technology as a result in order to protect future developments we will need
