society abbreviation jbs formation december    years ago  founder robert w welch jr fred c koch founded at indianapolis indiana us type political advocacy group legal status active headquarters appleton wisconsin united states region served united states ceo arthur thompson website wwwjbsorg the john birch society jbs is a selfdescribed conservative advocacy group supporting anticommunism and limited government it has been described as a radical right and farright organization businessman and founder robert w welch jr – developed an organizational infrastructure in  of chapters nationwide its main activity in the s said rick perlstein comprised monthly meetings to watch a film by welch followed by writing postcards or letters to government officials linking specific policies to the communist menace after an early rise in membership and influence efforts by those such as conservative william f buckley jr and national review led the jbs to be identified as a fringe element of the conservative movement mostly in fear of the radicalization of the american right originally based in belmont massachusetts it is now headquartered in appleton wisconsin with local chapters throughout the united states the organization owns american opinion publishing which publishes the new american contents  values  characterizations  history  origins  s  eisenhower issue  s  after welch  –present  officers  presidents  ceos  in popular culture  see also  references  further reading  scholarly studies  primary sources  criticizing the john birch society  external links valuesedit the organization supports limited government and opposes wealth redistribution and economic interventionism it opposes collectivism totalitarianism and communism it opposes socialism as well which it asserts is infiltrating us governmental administration in a  edition of crossfire congressman larry mcdonald dgeorgia then its newly appointed president characterized the society as belonging to the old right rather than the new right the society opposed the s civil rights movement and claimed the movement had communists in important positions in the latter half of  the jbs produced a flyer titled whats wrong with civil rights which was used as a newspaper advertisement in the piece one of the answers was for the civil rights movement in the united states with all of its growing agitation and riots and bitterness and insidious steps towards the appearance of a civil war has not been infiltrated by the communists as you now frequently hear it has been deliberately and almost wholly created by the communists patiently building up to this present stage for more than forty years the society opposed the civil rights act of  claiming it violated the tenth amendment to the united states constitution and overstepped individual states rights to enact laws regarding civil rights the society also opposed the equal rights amendment the society opposes one world government and it has an immigration reduction view on immigration reform it opposes the united nations the north american free trade agreement nafta the central america free trade agreement cafta the free trade area of the americas ftaa and other free trade agreements they argue the us constitution has been devalued in favor of political and economic globalization and that this alleged trend is not accidental it cited the existence of the former security and prosperity partnership as evidence of a push towards a north american union characterizationsedit the society has been described as ultraconservative far right and extremist other sources consider the society part of the patriot movement the southern poverty law center for example lists the society as a patriot group historyedit originsedit the society was established in indianapolis indiana on december   by a group of  led by robert w welch jr a retired candy manufacturer from belmont massachusetts welch named the new organization after john birch an american baptist missionary and military intelligence officer who was shot and killed by communist forces in china in august  shortly after the conclusion of world war ii welch claimed that birch was an unknown but dedicated anticommunist and the first american casualty of the cold war jimmy doolittle who met birch after bailing out over china following the tokyo raid said in his autobiography that he was certain that birch would not have approved of that particular use of his name harry lynde bradley cofounder of the allen bradley company and the lynde and harry bradley foundationnot in citation given fred c koch founder of koch industries robert waring stoddard president of wymangordon a major industrial enterprise were among the founding members another was revilo p oliver a university of illinois professor who was later expelled from the society and helped found the national alliance a transcript of welchs twoday presentation at the founding meeting was published as the blue book of the john birch society and became a cornerstone of its beliefs with each new member receiving a copy according to welch both the us and soviet governments are controlled by the same furtive conspiratorial cabal of internationalists greedy bankers and corrupt politicians if left unexposed the traitors inside the us government would betray the countrys sovereignty to the united nations for a collectivist new world order managed by a oneworld socialist government welch saw collectivism as the main threat to western culture and american liberals as secret communist traitors who provided cover for the gradual process of collectivism with the ultimate goal of replacing the nations of western civilization with a oneworld socialist government there are many stages of welfarism socialism and collectivism in general he wrote but communism is the ultimate state of them all and they all lead inevitably in that direction the societys activities include distribution of literature pamphlets magazines videos and other material while sponsoring a speakers bureau which invites speakers who are keenly aware of the motivations that drive political policy one of the first public activities of the society was a get us out of membership in the un campaign which claimed in  that the real nature of the un is to build a one world government in  welch advised jbs members to join your local pta at the beginning of the school year get your conservative friends to do likewise and go to work to take it over one mans opinion a magazine launched by welch in  was renamed american opinion and became the societys official publication the society publishes the new american a biweekly magazine sedit by march  the society had  to  members and according to welch a staff of  people in the home office about  coordinators or major coordinators in the field who are fully paid as to salary and expenses and about  coordinators or section leaders as they are called in some areas who work on a volunteer basis as to all or part of their salary or expenses or both according to political research associates a nonprofit research group that investigates the far right the society pioneered grassroots lobbying combining educational meetings petition drives and letterwriting campaigns one early campaign against the second summit between the united states and the soviet union generated over  postcards and letters according to the society in that same year welch offered  in prizes to college students for the best essays on grounds of impeachment of chief justice warren a prime target of ultraconservatives a june  society campaign to oppose xerox corporate sponsorship of tv programs favorable to the un produced  letters from  individuals in  william f buckley jr editor of the main conservative magazine the national review denounced welch and the john birch society as far removed from common sense and urged the gop to purge itself of welchs influence in the late s welch insisted that the johnson administrations fight against communism in vietnam was part of a communist plot aimed at taking over the united states welch demanded that the united states get out of vietnam thus aligning the society with the left the society opposed water fluoridation which it called mass medicine the jbs was moderately active in the s with numerous chapters but rarely engaged in coalition building with other conservatives it was rejected by most conservatives because of welchs conspiracy theories the philosopher ayn rand said in a  playboy interview i consider the birch society futile because they are not for capitalism but merely against communism  i gather they believe that the disastrous state of todays world is caused by a communist conspiracy this is childishly naïve and superficial no country can be destroyed by a mere conspiracy it can be destroyed only by ideas former eisenhower cabinet member ezra taft benson—a leading mormon—spoke in favor of the john birch society but in january  the lds church issued a statement distancing itself from the society antisemitic racist antimormon antimasonic groups criticized the organizations acceptance of jews nonwhites masons and mormons as members these opponents accused welch of harboring feminist ecumenical and evolutionary ideas welch rejected these accusations by his detractors all we are interested in here is opposing the advance of the communists and eventually destroying the whole communist conspiracy so that jews and christians alike and mohammedans and buddhists can again have a decent world in which to live in  welch favored barry goldwater for the republican presidential nomination but the membership split with twothirds supporting goldwater and onethird supporting richard nixon who did not run a number of birch members and their allies were goldwater supporters in  and some were delegates at the  republican national convention in april  a new york times article on new jersey and the society voiced—in part—a concern for the increasing tempo of radical right attacks on local government libraries school boards parentteacher associations mental health programs the republican party and most recently the ecumenical movement it then characterized the society as by far the most successful and respectable radical right organization in the country it operates alone or in support of other extremist organizations whose major preoccupation like that of the birchers is the internal communist conspiracy in the united states eisenhower issueedit welch wrote in a widely circulated statement the politician could eisenhower really be simply a smart politician entirely without principles and hungry for glory who is only the tool of the communists the answer is yes he went on with regard to  eisenhower it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason the controversial paragraph was removed before final publication of the politician the sensationalism of welchs charges against eisenhower prompted several conservatives and republicans most prominently goldwater and the intellectuals of william f buckleys circle to renounce outright or quietly shun the group buckley an early friend and admirer of welch regarded his accusations against eisenhower as paranoid and idiotic libels and attempted unsuccessfully to purge welch from the birch society from then on buckley who was editor of national review became the leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the antibircher conservatives in fact buckleys

john birch society jbs is a selfdescribed conservative advocacy group supporting anticommunism and limited government it has been described as a radical right and farright organization businessman and founder robert w welch jr – developed an organizational infrastructure in  of chapters nationwide its main activity in the s said rick perlstein comprised monthly meetings to watch a film by welch followed by writing postcards or letters to government officials linking specific policies to the communist menace after an early rise in membership and influence efforts by those such as conservative william f buckley jr and national review led the jbs to be identified as a fringe element of the conservative movement mostly in fear of the radicalization of the american right originally based in belmont massachusetts it is now headquartered in appleton wisconsin with local chapters throughout the united states the organization owns american opinion publishing which publishes the new american contents  values  characterizations  history  origins  s  eisenhower issue  s  after welch  –present  officers  presidents  ceos  in popular culture  see also  references  further reading  scholarly studies  primary sources  criticizing the john birch society  external links valuesedit the organization supports limited government and opposes wealth redistribution and economic interventionism it opposes collectivism totalitarianism and communism it opposes socialism as well which it asserts is infiltrating us governmental administration in a  edition of crossfire congressman larry mcdonald dgeorgia then its newly appointed president characterized the society as belonging to the old right rather than the new right the society opposed the s civil rights movement and claimed the movement had communists in important positions in the latter half of  the jbs produced a flyer titled whats wrong with civil rights which was used as a newspaper advertisement in the piece one of the answers was for the civil rights movement in the united states with all of its growing agitation and riots and bitterness and insidious steps towards the appearance of a civil war has not been infiltrated by the communists as you now frequently hear it has been deliberately and almost wholly created by the communists patiently building up to this present stage for more than forty years the society opposed the civil rights act of  claiming it violated the tenth amendment to the united states constitution and overstepped individual states rights to enact laws regarding civil rights the society also opposed the equal rights amendment the society opposes one world government and it has an immigration reduction view on immigration reform it opposes the united nations the north american free trade agreement nafta the central america free trade agreement cafta the free trade area of the americas ftaa and other free trade agreements they argue the us constitution has been devalued in favor of political and economic globalization and that this alleged trend is not accidental it cited the existence of the former security and prosperity partnership as evidence of a push towards a north american union characterizationsedit the society has been described as ultraconservative far right and extremist other sources consider the society part of the patriot movement the southern poverty law center for example lists the society as a patriot group historyedit originsedit the society was established in indianapolis indiana on december   by a group of  led by robert w welch jr a retired candy manufacturer from belmont massachusetts welch named the new organization after john birch an american baptist missionary and military intelligence officer who was shot and killed by communist forces in china in august  shortly after the conclusion of world war ii welch claimed that birch was an unknown but dedicated anticommunist and the first american casualty of the cold war jimmy doolittle who met birch after bailing out over china following the tokyo raid said in his autobiography that he was certain that birch would not have approved of that particular use of his name harry lynde bradley cofounder of the allen bradley company and the lynde and harry bradley foundationnot in citation given fred c koch founder of koch industries robert waring stoddard president of wymangordon a major industrial enterprise were among the founding members another was revilo p oliver a university of illinois professor who was later expelled from the society and helped found the national alliance a transcript of welchs twoday presentation at the founding meeting was published as the blue book of the john birch society and became a cornerstone of its beliefs with each new member receiving a copy according to welch both the us and soviet governments are controlled by the same furtive conspiratorial cabal of internationalists greedy bankers and corrupt politicians if left unexposed the traitors inside the us government would betray the countrys sovereignty to the united nations for a collectivist new world order managed by a oneworld socialist government welch saw collectivism as the main threat to western culture and american liberals as secret communist traitors who provided cover for the gradual process of collectivism with the ultimate goal of replacing the nations of western civilization with a oneworld socialist government there are many stages of welfarism socialism and collectivism in general he wrote but communism is the ultimate state of them all and they all lead inevitably in that direction the societys activities include distribution of literature pamphlets magazines videos and other material while sponsoring a speakers bureau which invites speakers who are keenly aware of the motivations that drive political policy one of the first public activities of the society was a get us out of membership in the un campaign which claimed in  that the real nature of the un is to build a one world government in  welch advised jbs members to join your local pta at the beginning of the school year get your conservative friends to do likewise and go to work to take it over one mans opinion a magazine launched by welch in  was renamed american opinion and became the societys official publication the society publishes the new american a biweekly magazine sedit by march  the society had  to  members and according to welch a staff of  people in the home office about  coordinators or major coordinators in the field who are fully paid as to salary and expenses and about  coordinators or section leaders as they are called in some areas who work on a volunteer basis as to all or part of their salary or expenses or both according to political research associates a nonprofit research group that investigates the far right the society pioneered grassroots lobbying combining educational meetings petition drives and letterwriting campaigns one early campaign against the second summit between the united states and the soviet union generated over  postcards and letters according to the society in that same year welch offered  in prizes to college students for the best essays on grounds of impeachment of chief justice warren a prime target of ultraconservatives a june  society campaign to oppose xerox corporate sponsorship of tv programs favorable to the un produced  letters from  individuals in  william f buckley jr editor of the main conservative magazine the national review denounced welch and the john birch society as far removed from common sense and urged the gop to purge itself of welchs influence in the late s welch insisted that the johnson administrations fight against communism in vietnam was part of a communist plot aimed at taking over the united states welch demanded that the united states get out of vietnam thus aligning the society with the left the society opposed water fluoridation which it called mass medicine the jbs was moderately active in the s with numerous chapters but rarely engaged in coalition building with other conservatives it was rejected by most conservatives because of welchs conspiracy theories the philosopher ayn rand said in a  playboy interview i consider the birch society futile because they are not for capitalism but merely against communism  i gather they believe that the disastrous state of todays world is caused by a communist conspiracy this is childishly naïve and superficial no country can be destroyed by a mere conspiracy it can be destroyed only by ideas former eisenhower cabinet member ezra taft benson—a leading mormon—spoke in favor of the john birch society but in january  the lds church issued a statement distancing itself from the society antisemitic racist antimormon antimasonic groups criticized the organizations acceptance of jews nonwhites masons and mormons as members these opponents accused welch of harboring feminist ecumenical and evolutionary ideas welch rejected these accusations by his detractors all we are interested in here is opposing the advance of the communists and eventually destroying the whole communist conspiracy so that jews and christians alike and mohammedans and buddhists can again have a decent world in which to live in  welch favored barry goldwater for the republican presidential nomination but the membership split with twothirds supporting goldwater and onethird supporting richard nixon who did not run a number of birch members and their allies were goldwater supporters in  and some were delegates at the  republican national convention in april  a new york times article on new jersey and the society voiced—in part—a concern for the increasing tempo of radical right attacks on local government libraries school boards parentteacher associations mental health programs the republican party and most recently the ecumenical movement it then characterized the society as by far the most successful and respectable radical right organization in the country it operates alone or in support of other extremist organizations whose major preoccupation like that of the birchers is the internal communist conspiracy in the united states eisenhower issueedit welch wrote in a widely circulated statement the politician could eisenhower really be simply a smart politician entirely without principles and hungry for glory who is only the tool of the communists the answer is yes he went on with regard to  eisenhower it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason the controversial paragraph was removed before final publication of the politician the sensationalism of welchs charges against eisenhower prompted several conservatives and republicans most prominently goldwater and the intellectuals of william f buckleys circle to renounce outright or quietly shun the group buckley an early friend and admirer of welch regarded his accusations against eisenhower as paranoid and idiotic libels and attempted unsuccessfully to purge welch from the birch society from then on buckley who was editor of national review became the leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the antibircher conservatives in fact buckleys biographer john b judis wrote that buckley was beginning to worry that with the john birch society growing so rapidly the rightwing upsurge in the country would take an ugly even fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism national review had promoted sedit the society was at

wisconsin united states region served united states ceo arthur thompson website wwwjbsorg the john birch society jbs is a selfdescribed conservative advocacy group supporting anticommunism and limited government it has been described as a radical right and farright organization businessman and founder robert w welch jr – developed an organizational infrastructure in  of chapters nationwide its main activity in the s said rick perlstein comprised monthly meetings to watch a film by welch followed by writing postcards or letters to government officials linking specific policies to the communist menace after an early rise in membership and influence efforts by those such as conservative william f buckley jr and national review led the jbs to be identified as a fringe element of the conservative movement mostly in fear of the radicalization of the american right originally based in belmont massachusetts it is now headquartered in appleton wisconsin with local chapters throughout the united states the organization owns american opinion publishing which publishes the new american contents  values  characterizations  history  origins  s  eisenhower issue  s  after welch  –present  officers  presidents  ceos  in popular culture  see also  references  further reading  scholarly studies  primary sources  criticizing the john birch society  external links valuesedit the organization supports limited government and opposes wealth redistribution and economic interventionism it opposes collectivism totalitarianism and communism it opposes socialism as well which it asserts is infiltrating us governmental administration in a  edition of crossfire congressman larry mcdonald dgeorgia then its newly appointed president characterized the society as belonging to the old right rather than the new right the society opposed the s civil rights movement and claimed the movement had communists in important positions in the latter half of  the jbs produced a flyer titled whats wrong with civil rights which was used as a newspaper advertisement in the piece one of the answers was for the civil rights movement in the united states with all of its growing agitation and riots and bitterness and insidious steps towards the appearance of a civil war has not been infiltrated by the communists as you now frequently hear it has been deliberately and almost wholly created by the communists patiently building up to this present stage for more than forty years the society opposed the civil rights act of  claiming it violated the tenth amendment to the united states constitution and overstepped individual states rights to enact laws regarding civil rights the society also opposed the equal rights amendment the society opposes one world government and it has an immigration reduction view on immigration reform it opposes the united nations the north american free trade agreement nafta the central america free trade agreement cafta the free trade area of the americas ftaa and other free trade agreements they argue the us constitution has been devalued in favor of political and economic globalization and that this alleged trend is not accidental it cited the existence of the former security and prosperity partnership as evidence of a push towards a north american union characterizationsedit the society has been described as ultraconservative far right and extremist other sources consider the society part of the patriot movement the southern poverty law center for example lists the society as a patriot group historyedit originsedit the society was established in indianapolis indiana on december   by a group of  led by robert w welch jr a retired candy manufacturer from belmont massachusetts welch named the new organization after john birch an american baptist missionary and military intelligence officer who was shot and killed by communist forces in china in august  shortly after the conclusion of world war ii welch claimed that birch was an unknown but dedicated anticommunist and the first american casualty of the cold war jimmy doolittle who met birch after bailing out over china following the tokyo raid said in his autobiography that he was certain that birch would not have approved of that particular use of his name harry lynde bradley cofounder of the allen bradley company and the lynde and harry bradley foundationnot in citation given fred c koch founder of koch industries robert waring stoddard president of wymangordon a major industrial enterprise were among the founding members another was revilo p oliver a university of illinois professor who was later expelled from the society and helped found the national alliance a transcript of welchs twoday presentation at the founding meeting was published as the blue book of the john birch society and became a cornerstone of its beliefs with each new member receiving a copy according to welch both the us and soviet governments are controlled by the same furtive conspiratorial cabal of internationalists greedy bankers and corrupt politicians if left unexposed the traitors inside the us government would betray the countrys sovereignty to the united nations for a collectivist new world order managed by a oneworld socialist government welch saw collectivism as the main threat to western culture and american liberals as secret communist traitors who provided cover for the gradual process of collectivism with the ultimate goal of replacing the nations of western civilization with a oneworld socialist government there are many stages of welfarism socialism and collectivism in general he wrote but communism is the ultimate state of them all and they all lead inevitably in that direction the societys activities include distribution of literature pamphlets magazines videos and other material while sponsoring a speakers bureau which invites speakers who are keenly aware of the motivations that drive political policy one of the first public activities of the society was a get us out of membership in the un campaign which claimed in  that the real nature of the un is to build a one world government in  welch advised jbs members to join your local pta at the beginning of the school year get your conservative friends to do likewise and go to work to take it over one mans opinion a magazine launched by welch in  was renamed american opinion and became the societys official publication the society publishes the new american a biweekly magazine sedit by march  the society had  to  members and according to welch a staff of  people in the home office about  coordinators or major coordinators in the field who are fully paid as to salary and expenses and about  coordinators or section leaders as they are called in some areas who work on a volunteer basis as to all or part of their salary or expenses or both according to political research associates a nonprofit research group that investigates the far right the society pioneered grassroots lobbying combining educational meetings petition drives and letterwriting campaigns one early campaign against the second summit between the united states and the soviet union generated over  postcards and letters according to the society in that same year welch offered  in prizes to college students for the best essays on grounds of impeachment of chief justice warren a prime target of ultraconservatives a june  society campaign to oppose xerox corporate sponsorship of tv programs favorable to the un produced  letters from  individuals in  william f buckley jr editor of the main conservative magazine the national review denounced welch and the john birch society as far removed from common sense and urged the gop to purge itself of welchs influence in the late s welch insisted that the johnson administrations fight against communism in vietnam was part of a communist plot aimed at taking over the united states welch demanded that the united states get out of vietnam thus aligning the society with the left the society opposed water fluoridation which it called mass medicine the jbs was moderately active in the s with numerous chapters but rarely engaged in coalition building with other conservatives it was rejected by most conservatives because of welchs conspiracy theories the philosopher ayn rand said in a  playboy interview i consider the birch society futile because they are not for capitalism but merely against communism  i gather they believe that the disastrous state of todays world is caused by a communist conspiracy this is childishly naïve and superficial no country can be destroyed by a mere conspiracy it can be destroyed only by ideas former eisenhower cabinet member ezra taft benson—a leading mormon—spoke in favor of the john birch society but in january  the lds church issued a statement distancing itself from the society antisemitic racist antimormon antimasonic groups criticized the organizations acceptance of jews nonwhites masons and mormons as members these opponents accused welch of harboring feminist ecumenical and evolutionary ideas welch rejected these accusations by his detractors all we are interested in here is opposing the advance of the communists and eventually destroying the whole communist conspiracy so that jews and christians alike and mohammedans and buddhists can again have a decent world in which to live in  welch favored barry goldwater for the republican presidential nomination but the membership split with twothirds supporting goldwater and onethird supporting richard nixon who did not run a number of birch members and their allies were goldwater supporters in  and some were delegates at the  republican national convention in april  a new york times article on new jersey and the society voiced—in part—a concern for the increasing tempo of radical right attacks on local government libraries school boards parentteacher associations mental health programs the republican party and most recently the ecumenical movement it then characterized the society as by far the most successful and respectable radical right organization in the country it operates alone or in support of other extremist organizations whose major preoccupation like that of the birchers is the internal communist conspiracy in the united states eisenhower issueedit welch wrote in a widely circulated statement the politician could eisenhower really be simply a smart politician entirely without principles and hungry for glory who is only the tool of the communists the answer is yes he went on with regard to  eisenhower it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason the controversial paragraph was removed before final publication of the politician the sensationalism of welchs charges against eisenhower prompted several conservatives and republicans most prominently goldwater and the intellectuals of william f buckleys circle to renounce outright or quietly shun the group buckley an early friend and admirer of welch regarded his accusations against eisenhower as paranoid and idiotic libels and attempted unsuccessfully to purge welch from the birch society from then on buckley who was editor of national review became the leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the antibircher conservatives in fact buckleys biographer john b judis wrote that buckley was beginning to worry that with the john birch society growing so rapidly the rightwing upsurge in the country would take an ugly even fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism national review had promoted sedit the society was at the center of a freespeech law case in the s after american opinion accused a chicago lawyer elmer gertz who was representing the family of a young man killed by a police officer of being part of a communist conspiracy to merge all police agencies in the country into one large force the resulting libel suit gertz v robert welch inc reached the united states supreme court which held that a state may allow a private figure such as gertz to recover actual damages from a media defendant without proving malice but that a public figure does have to prove actual malice according to the standard laid out in new york times co v sullivan in order to recover presumed damages or punitive damages the court ordered a retrial in which gertz prevailed key society causes of the s included opposition to both the occupational safety and health administration osha and to the establishment of diplomatic ties with the peoples republic of china the society claimed in  that the regime of mao zedong had murdered  million chinese as of that year and that it was the primary supplier of illicit heroin into the united states this led to bumper stickers showing a pair of scissors cutting a hypodermic needle in half accompanied by the slogan cut the red china connection the society also was opposed to transferring control of the panama canal from american to panamanian sovereignty the society was organized into local chapters during this period ernest brosang a new jersey regional coordinator claimed that it was virtually impossible for opponents of the society to penetrate its policymaking levels thereby protecting it from antiamerican takeover attempts its activities included the distribution of literature critical of civil rights legislation warnings over the influence of the united nations and the release of petitions to impeach united states supreme court justice earl warren to spread their message members held showings of documentary films and operated initiatives such as let freedom ring a nationwide network of recorded telephone messages after welchedit a sign advocating americas withdrawal produced by the john birch society by the time of welchs death in  the societys membership and influence had dramatically declined the society continues to press for an end to united states membership in the united nations as evidence of the effectiveness of jbs efforts the society points to the utah state legislatures failed resolution calling for united states withdrawal as well as the actions of several other states where the societys membership has been active since its founding the society has repeatedly opposed united states military intervention overseas although it strongly supports the american military it has issued calls to bring our troops home in every conflict since its founding including vietnam the society also has a national speakers committee called american opinion speakers bureau aosb and an antitax committee called trim tax reform immediately the second head of the society was congressman larry mcdonald d from georgia who was killed on september   when airliner kal  was shot down by a soviet interceptor william p hoar has been active as a writer for the society he is noted for very strong attacks on mainstream politicians from franklin d roosevelt to george w bush he publishes regularly in the new american and its predecessor american opinion he coauthored the clinton clique with larry abraham alleging that clinton was part of the angloamerican conspiracy supposedly ruled through the council on foreign relations and the trilateral commission the birch society publications arm western islands published his architects of conspiracy an intriguing history  and huntington house publishers published his handouts and pickpockets our government gone berserk  –presentedit the society has been active in supporting the auditing of and aims to eventually dismantle the federal reserve system the jbs holds that the united states constitution gives only congress the ability to coin money and does not permit it to delegate this power or to transform the dollar into a fiat currency not backed by gold or silver the jbs was a cosponsor of the  conservative political action conference ending its decadeslong exile from the mainstream conservative movement in  the american conservative union board voted to not invite the jbs to the conference jbs is opposed to modern day efforts to call a

society was lampooned in a song named the john birch society by the chad mitchell trio in  bob dylan recorded talkin john birch paranoid blues which poked fun at the society and its tendency to see communist conspiracies in many situations when he attempted to perform it on the ed sullivan show in  however cbss standards and practices department forbade it fearing that lyrics equating the society’s views with those of adolf hitler might trigger a defamation lawsuit dylan was offered the opportunity to perform a different song but he responded that if he could not sing the number of his choice he would rather not appear at all the story generated widespread media attention in the days that followed sullivan denounced the networks decision in published interviews cartoonist walt kelly lampooned the john birch society in his comic strip pogo with two of his less savory characters creating the jack acid society to weed out anyone they suspected of being unamerican the  single uneasy

founder robert w welch jr – developed an organizational infrastructure in  of chapters nationwide its main activity in the s said rick perlstein comprised monthly meetings to watch a film by welch followed by writing postcards or letters to government officials linking specific policies to the communist menace after an early rise in membership and influence efforts by those such as conservative william f buckley jr and national review led the jbs to be identified as a fringe element of the conservative movement mostly in fear of the radicalization of the american right originally based in

opposes collectivism totalitarianism and communism it opposes socialism as well which it asserts is infiltrating us governmental administration in a  edition of crossfire congressman larry mcdonald dgeorgia then its newly appointed president characterized the society as belonging to the old right rather than the new right the society opposed the s civil rights movement and claimed the movement had communists in important positions in the latter half of  the jbs produced a flyer titled whats wrong with civil rights which was used as a newspaper advertisement in the piece one of the answers was for the civil rights movement in the united states with all of its growing agitation and riots and bitterness and insidious steps towards the appearance of a civil war has not been infiltrated by the communists as you now frequently hear it has been deliberately and almost wholly created by the communists patiently building up to this present stage for more than forty years the society opposed the civil rights act of  claiming it violated the tenth amendment to the united states constitution and overstepped individual states rights to enact laws regarding civil rights the society also opposed the equal rights amendment the society opposes one world government and it has an immigration reduction view on immigration reform it opposes the united nations the north american free trade agreement nafta the central america free trade agreement cafta the free trade area of the americas ftaa and other free trade agreements they argue the us constitution has been devalued in favor of political and economic globalization and that this alleged trend is not accidental it cited the existence of the former security and prosperity partnership as evidence of a push towards a north american union characterizationsedit the society has been described as ultraconservative far right and extremist other sources consider the society part of the patriot movement the southern poverty law center for example lists the society as a patriot group historyedit originsedit the society was established in indianapolis indiana on december   by a group of  led by robert w welch jr a retired candy manufacturer from belmont massachusetts welch named the new organization after john birch an american baptist missionary and military intelligence officer who was shot and killed by communist forces in china in august  shortly after the conclusion of world war ii welch claimed that birch was an unknown but dedicated anticommunist and the first american casualty of the cold war jimmy doolittle who met birch after bailing out over china following the tokyo raid said in his autobiography that he was certain that birch would not have approved of that particular use of his name harry lynde bradley cofounder of the allen bradley company and the lynde and harry bradley foundationnot in citation given fred c koch founder of koch industries robert waring stoddard president of wymangordon a major industrial enterprise were among the founding members another was revilo p oliver a university of illinois professor who was later expelled from the society and helped found the national alliance a transcript of welchs twoday presentation at the founding meeting was published as the blue book of the john birch society and became a cornerstone of its beliefs with each new member receiving a copy according to welch both the us and soviet governments are controlled by the same furtive conspiratorial cabal of internationalists greedy bankers and corrupt politicians if left unexposed the traitors inside the us government would betray the countrys sovereignty to the united nations for a collectivist new world order managed by a oneworld socialist government welch saw collectivism as the main threat to western culture and american liberals as secret communist traitors who provided cover for the gradual process of collectivism with the ultimate goal of replacing the nations of western civilization with a oneworld socialist government there are many stages of welfarism socialism and collectivism in general he wrote but communism is the ultimate state of them all and they all lead inevitably in that direction the societys activities include distribution of literature pamphlets magazines videos and other material while sponsoring a speakers bureau which invites speakers who are keenly aware of the motivations that drive political policy one of the first public activities of the society was a get us out of membership in the un campaign which claimed in  that the real nature of the un is to build a one world government in  welch advised jbs members to join your local pta at the beginning of the school year get your conservative friends to do likewise and go to work to take it over one mans opinion a magazine launched by welch in  was renamed american opinion and became the societys official publication the society publishes the new american a biweekly magazine sedit by march  the society had  to  members and according to welch a staff of  people in the home office about  coordinators or major coordinators in the field who are fully paid as to salary and expenses and about  coordinators or section leaders as they are called in some areas who work on a volunteer basis as to all or part of their salary or expenses or both according to political research associates a nonprofit research group that investigates the far right the society pioneered grassroots lobbying combining educational meetings petition drives and letterwriting campaigns one early campaign against the second summit between the united states and the soviet union generated over  postcards and letters according to the society in that same year welch offered  in prizes to college students for the best essays on grounds of impeachment of chief justice warren a prime target of ultraconservatives a june  society campaign to oppose xerox corporate sponsorship of tv programs favorable to the un produced  letters from  individuals in  william f buckley jr editor of the main conservative magazine the national review denounced welch and the john birch society as far removed from common sense and urged the gop to purge itself of welchs influence in the late s welch insisted that the johnson administrations fight against communism in vietnam was part of a communist plot aimed at taking over the united states welch demanded that the united states get out of vietnam thus aligning the society with the left the society opposed water fluoridation which it called mass medicine the jbs was moderately active in the s with numerous chapters but rarely engaged in coalition building with other conservatives it was rejected by most conservatives because of welchs conspiracy theories the philosopher ayn rand said in a  playboy interview i consider the birch society futile because they are not for capitalism but merely against communism  i gather they believe that the disastrous state of todays world is caused by a communist conspiracy this is childishly naïve and superficial no country can be destroyed by a mere conspiracy it can be destroyed only by ideas former eisenhower cabinet member ezra taft benson—a leading mormon—spoke in favor of the john birch society but in january  the lds church issued a statement distancing itself from the society antisemitic racist antimormon antimasonic groups criticized the organizations acceptance of jews nonwhites masons and mormons as members these opponents accused welch of harboring feminist ecumenical and evolutionary ideas welch rejected these accusations by his detractors all we are interested in here is opposing the advance of the communists and eventually destroying the whole communist conspiracy so that jews and christians alike and mohammedans and buddhists can again have a decent world in which to live in  welch favored barry goldwater for the republican presidential nomination but the membership split with twothirds supporting goldwater and onethird supporting richard nixon who did not run a number of birch members and their allies were goldwater supporters in  and some were delegates at the  republican national convention in april  a new york times article on new jersey and the society voiced—in part—a concern for the increasing tempo of radical right attacks on local government libraries school boards parentteacher associations mental health programs the republican party and most recently the ecumenical movement it then characterized the society as by far the most successful and respectable radical right organization in the country it operates alone or in support of other extremist organizations whose major preoccupation like that of the birchers is the internal communist conspiracy in the united states eisenhower issueedit welch wrote in a widely circulated statement the politician could eisenhower really be simply a smart politician entirely without principles and hungry for glory who is only the tool of the communists the answer is yes he went on with regard to  eisenhower it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason the controversial paragraph was removed before final publication of the politician the sensationalism of welchs charges against eisenhower prompted several conservatives and republicans most prominently goldwater and the intellectuals of william f buckleys circle to renounce outright or quietly shun the group buckley an early friend and admirer of welch regarded his accusations against eisenhower as paranoid and idiotic libels and attempted unsuccessfully to purge welch from the birch society from then on buckley who was editor of national review became the leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the antibircher conservatives in fact buckleys biographer john b judis wrote that buckley was beginning to worry that with the john birch society growing so rapidly the rightwing upsurge in the country would take an ugly even fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism national review had promoted sedit the society was at the center of a freespeech law case in the s after american opinion accused a chicago lawyer elmer gertz who was representing the family of a young man killed by a police officer of being part of a communist conspiracy to merge all police agencies in the country into one large force the resulting libel suit gertz v robert welch inc reached the united states supreme court which held that a state may allow a private figure such as gertz to recover actual damages from a media defendant without proving malice but that a public figure does have to prove actual malice according to the standard laid out in new york times co v sullivan in order to recover presumed damages or punitive damages the court ordered a retrial in which gertz prevailed key society causes of the s included opposition to both the occupational safety and health administration osha and to the establishment of diplomatic ties with the peoples republic of china the society claimed in  that the regime of mao zedong had murdered  million chinese as of that year and that it was the primary supplier of illicit heroin into the united states this led to bumper stickers showing a pair of scissors cutting a hypodermic needle in half accompanied by the slogan cut the red china connection the society also was opposed to transferring control of the panama canal from american to panamanian sovereignty the society was organized into local chapters during this period ernest brosang a new jersey regional coordinator claimed that it was virtually impossible for opponents of the society to penetrate its policymaking levels thereby protecting it from antiamerican takeover attempts its activities included the distribution of literature critical of civil rights legislation warnings over the influence of the united nations and the release of petitions to impeach united states supreme court justice earl warren to spread their message members held showings of documentary films and operated initiatives such as let freedom ring a nationwide network of recorded telephone messages after welchedit a sign advocating americas withdrawal produced by the john birch society by the time of welchs death in  the societys membership and influence had dramatically declined the society continues to press for an end to united states membership in the united nations as evidence of the effectiveness of jbs efforts the society points to the utah state legislatures failed resolution calling for united states withdrawal as well as the actions of several other states where the societys membership has been active since its founding the society has repeatedly opposed united states military intervention overseas although it strongly supports the american military it has issued calls to bring our troops home in every conflict since its founding including vietnam the society also has a national speakers committee called american opinion speakers bureau aosb and an antitax committee called trim tax reform immediately the second head of the society was congressman larry mcdonald d from georgia who was killed on september   when airliner kal  was shot down by a soviet interceptor william p hoar has been active as a writer for the society he is noted for very strong attacks on mainstream politicians from franklin d roosevelt to george w bush he publishes regularly in the new american and its predecessor american opinion he coauthored the clinton clique with larry abraham alleging that clinton was part of the angloamerican conspiracy supposedly ruled through the council on foreign relations and the trilateral commission the birch society publications arm western islands published his architects of conspiracy an intriguing history  and huntington house publishers published his handouts and pickpockets our government gone berserk  –presentedit the society has been active in supporting the auditing of and aims to eventually dismantle the federal reserve system the jbs holds that the united states constitution gives only congress the ability to coin money and does not permit it to delegate this power or to transform the dollar into a fiat currency not backed by gold or silver the jbs was a cosponsor of the  conservative political action conference ending its decadeslong exile from the mainstream conservative movement in  the american conservative union board voted

john birch paranoid blues which poked fun at the society and its tendency to see communist conspiracies in many situations when he attempted to perform it on the ed sullivan show in  however cbss standards and practices department forbade it fearing that lyrics equating the society’s views with those of adolf hitler might trigger a defamation lawsuit dylan was offered the opportunity to perform a different song but he responded that if he could not sing the number of his choice he would rather not appear at all the story generated widespread media attention in the days that followed sullivan denounced the networks decision in published interviews cartoonist walt kelly lampooned the john birch society in his comic strip pogo with two of his less savory characters creating the jack

old right rather than the new right the society opposed the s civil rights movement and claimed the movement had communists in important positions in the latter half of  the jbs produced a flyer titled whats wrong with civil rights which was used as a newspaper advertisement in the piece one of the answers was for the civil rights movement in the united states with all of its growing agitation and riots and bitterness and insidious steps towards the appearance of a civil war has not been infiltrated by the communists as you now frequently hear it has been deliberately and almost wholly created by the communists patiently building up to this present stage for more than forty years the society opposed the civil rights act of  claiming it violated the tenth amendment to the united states constitution and overstepped individual states rights to enact laws regarding civil rights the society also opposed the equal rights amendment the society opposes one world government

accidental it cited the existence of the former security and prosperity partnership as evidence of a push towards a north american union characterizationsedit the society has been described as ultraconservative far right and extremist other sources consider the society part of the patriot movement the southern poverty law center for example lists the society as a patriot group historyedit originsedit the society was established in indianapolis indiana on december   by a group of  led by robert w welch jr a retired candy manufacturer from belmont massachusetts welch named the new organization after john birch an american baptist missionary and military intelligence officer who was shot and killed by communist forces in china in august  shortly after the conclusion of world war ii welch claimed that birch was an unknown but dedicated anticommunist and the first american casualty of the cold war jimmy doolittle who met birch after bailing out over china following the tokyo raid said in his autobiography that he was certain that birch would not have approved of that particular use of his name harry lynde bradley cofounder of the allen bradley company and the lynde and harry bradley foundationnot in citation given fred c koch founder of koch industries robert waring stoddard president of wymangordon a major industrial enterprise were among the founding members another was revilo p oliver a university of illinois professor who was later expelled from the society and helped found the national alliance a transcript of welchs twoday presentation at the founding meeting was published as the blue book of the john birch society and became a cornerstone of its beliefs with each new member receiving a copy according to welch both the us and soviet governments are controlled by the same furtive conspiratorial cabal of internationalists greedy bankers and corrupt politicians if left unexposed the traitors inside the us government would betray the countrys sovereignty to the united nations for a collectivist new world order managed by a oneworld socialist government welch saw collectivism as the main threat to western culture and american liberals as secret communist traitors who provided cover for the gradual process of collectivism with the ultimate goal of replacing the nations of western civilization with a oneworld socialist government there are many stages of welfarism socialism and collectivism in general he wrote but communism is the ultimate state of them all and they all lead inevitably in that direction the societys activities include distribution of literature pamphlets magazines videos and other material while sponsoring a speakers bureau which invites speakers who are keenly aware of the motivations that drive political policy one of the first public activities of the society was a get us out of membership in the un campaign which claimed in  that the real nature of the un is to build a one world government in  welch advised jbs members to join your local pta at the beginning of the school year get your conservative friends to do likewise and go to work to take it over one mans opinion a magazine launched by welch in  was renamed american opinion and became the societys official publication the society publishes the new american a biweekly magazine sedit by march  the society had  to  members and according to welch a staff of  people in the home office about  coordinators or major coordinators in the field who are fully paid as to salary and expenses and about  coordinators or section leaders as they are called in some areas who work on a volunteer basis as to all or part of their salary or expenses or both according to political research associates a nonprofit research group that investigates the far right the society pioneered grassroots lobbying combining educational meetings petition drives and letterwriting campaigns one early campaign against the second summit between the united states and the soviet union generated over  postcards and letters according to the society in that same year welch offered  in prizes to college students for the best essays on grounds of impeachment of chief justice warren a prime target of ultraconservatives a june  society campaign to oppose xerox corporate sponsorship of tv programs favorable to the un produced  letters from  individuals in  william f buckley jr editor of the main conservative magazine the national review denounced welch and the john birch society as far removed from common sense and urged the gop to purge itself of welchs influence in the late s welch insisted that the johnson administrations fight against communism in vietnam was part of a communist plot aimed at taking over the united states welch demanded that the united states get out of vietnam thus aligning the society with the left the society opposed water fluoridation which it called mass medicine the jbs was moderately active in the s with numerous chapters but rarely engaged in coalition building with other conservatives it was rejected by most conservatives because of welchs conspiracy theories the philosopher ayn rand said in a  playboy interview i consider the birch society futile because they are not for capitalism but merely against communism  i gather they believe that the disastrous state of todays world is caused by a communist conspiracy this is childishly naïve and superficial no country can be destroyed by a mere conspiracy it can be destroyed only by ideas former eisenhower cabinet member ezra taft benson—a leading mormon—spoke in favor of the john birch society but in january  the lds church issued a statement distancing itself from the society antisemitic racist antimormon antimasonic groups criticized the organizations acceptance of jews nonwhites masons and mormons as members these opponents accused welch of harboring feminist ecumenical and evolutionary ideas welch rejected these accusations by his detractors all we are interested in here is opposing the advance of the communists and eventually destroying the whole communist conspiracy so that jews and christians alike and mohammedans and buddhists can again have a decent world in which to live in  welch favored barry goldwater for the republican presidential nomination but the membership split with twothirds supporting goldwater and onethird supporting richard nixon who did not run a number of birch members and their allies were goldwater supporters in  and some were delegates at the  republican national convention in april  a new york times article on new jersey and the society voiced—in part—a concern for the increasing tempo of radical right attacks on local government libraries school boards parentteacher associations mental health programs the republican party and most recently the ecumenical movement it then characterized the society as by far the most successful and respectable radical right organization in the country it operates alone or in support of other extremist organizations whose major preoccupation like that of the birchers is the internal communist conspiracy in the united states eisenhower issueedit welch wrote in a widely circulated statement the politician could eisenhower really be simply a smart politician entirely without principles and hungry for glory who is only the tool of the communists the answer is yes he went on with regard to  eisenhower it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason the controversial paragraph was removed before final publication of the politician the sensationalism of welchs charges against eisenhower prompted several conservatives and republicans most prominently goldwater and the intellectuals of william f buckleys circle to renounce outright or quietly shun the group buckley an early friend and admirer of welch regarded his accusations against eisenhower as paranoid and idiotic libels and attempted unsuccessfully to purge welch from the birch society from then on buckley who was editor of national review became the leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the antibircher conservatives in fact buckleys biographer john b judis wrote that buckley was beginning to worry that with the john birch society growing so rapidly the rightwing upsurge in the country would take an ugly even fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism national review had promoted sedit the society was at the center of a freespeech law case in the s after american opinion accused a chicago lawyer elmer gertz who was representing the family of a young man killed by a police officer of being part of a communist conspiracy to merge all police agencies in the country into one large force the resulting libel suit gertz v robert welch inc reached the united states supreme court which held that a state may allow a private figure such as gertz to recover actual damages from a media defendant without proving malice but that a public figure does have to prove actual malice according to the standard laid out in new york times co v sullivan in order to recover presumed damages or punitive damages the court ordered a retrial in which gertz prevailed key society causes of the s included opposition to both the occupational safety and health administration osha and to the establishment of diplomatic ties with the peoples republic of china the society claimed in  that the regime of mao zedong had murdered  million chinese as of that year and that it was the primary supplier of illicit heroin into the united states this led to bumper stickers showing a pair of scissors cutting a hypodermic needle in half accompanied by the slogan cut the red china connection the society also was opposed to transferring control of the panama canal from american to panamanian sovereignty the society was organized into local chapters during this period ernest brosang a new jersey regional coordinator claimed that it was virtually impossible for opponents of the society to penetrate its policymaking levels thereby protecting it from antiamerican takeover attempts its activities included the distribution of literature critical of civil rights legislation warnings over the influence of the united nations and the release of petitions to impeach united states supreme court justice earl warren to spread their message members held showings of documentary films and operated initiatives such as let freedom ring a nationwide network of recorded telephone messages after welchedit a sign advocating americas withdrawal produced by the john birch society by the time of welchs death in  the societys membership and influence had dramatically declined the society continues to press for an end to united states membership in the united nations as evidence of the effectiveness of jbs efforts the society points to the utah state legislatures failed resolution calling for united states withdrawal as well as the actions of several other states where the societys membership has been active since its founding the society has repeatedly opposed united states military intervention overseas although it strongly supports the american military it has issued calls to bring our troops home in every conflict since its founding including vietnam the society also has a national speakers committee called american opinion speakers bureau aosb and an antitax committee called trim tax reform immediately the second head of the society was congressman larry mcdonald d from georgia who was killed on september   when airliner kal  was shot down by a soviet interceptor william p hoar has been active as a writer for the society he is noted for very strong attacks on mainstream politicians from franklin d roosevelt to george w bush he publishes regularly in the new american and its predecessor american opinion he coauthored the clinton clique with larry abraham alleging that clinton was part of the angloamerican conspiracy supposedly ruled through the council on foreign relations and the trilateral commission the birch society publications arm western islands published his architects of conspiracy an intriguing history  and huntington house publishers published his handouts and pickpockets our government gone berserk  –presentedit the society has been active in supporting the auditing of and aims to eventually dismantle the federal reserve system the jbs holds that the united states constitution gives only congress the ability to coin money and does not permit it to delegate this power or to transform the dollar into a fiat currency not backed by gold or silver the jbs was a cosponsor of the  conservative political action conference ending its decadeslong exile from the mainstream conservative movement in  the american conservative union board voted to not invite the jbs to the conference jbs is opposed to modern day efforts to call a convention to propose amendments to the united states constitution officersedit presidentsedit robert w welch jr – larry mcdonald  a us representative who was killed in the kal shootdown incident

society was lampooned in a song named the john birch society by the chad mitchell trio in  bob dylan recorded talkin john birch paranoid blues which poked fun at the society and its tendency to see communist conspiracies in many situations when he attempted to perform it on the ed sullivan show in  however cbss standards and practices department forbade it fearing that lyrics equating the society’s views with those of adolf hitler might trigger a defamation lawsuit dylan was offered the opportunity to perform a different song but he responded that if he could not sing the number of his choice he would rather not appear at all the story generated widespread media attention in the days that followed sullivan denounced the networks decision in published interviews cartoonist walt kelly lampooned the john birch society in his comic strip pogo with two of his less savory characters creating the jack acid society to weed out anyone they suspected of being unamerican the  single uneasy rider by charlie daniels includes a line im a faithful follower of brother john birch reportedly spoken by a local southern man attempting to reestablish his bona fides among his neighbors after he was accused of being a hippie communist and an fbi agent in  new york daily news sports writer mike lupica had the following to say about former troubled yankee pitcher and john birch member ed
