the year mass market retailer   gold medal award national retail federation  address target corporation  nicollet mall minneapolis minnesota  httpwwwtargetcorpcom ■ in the bleak discountretailing landscape littered with the ruins of countless lowprice chains that found survival impossible in the era of walmart target stores managed not only to survive but to prosper the chains success had to be credited in large part to the genius of robert ulrich the chairman and chief executive officer of the parent target corporation for more than a decade while bradlees caldor montgomery ward and others fell by the wayside and oncemighty kmart was forced to reorganize under chapter  ulrich found a way for target to distinguish itself from the rest of the pack most importantly for targets shareholders ulrich managed not just to keep target alfoat but to generate impressive growth in sales and profits one measure of ulrichs success of course was his compensation which for both  and  was declared the highest in the us retailing industry by home textiles today  the magazine reported on january   that ulrichs  pay—including salary bonus and stock options—totaled  million up just over  percent from the  million of the year before a distant second on the magazines list of s toppaid retailing executives was lawrence montgomery the ceo of kohls who pulled in a total of  million lee scott ulrichs counterpart at walmart was paid a total of  million many believed ulrich could challenge walmart although talk of target mounting a serious challenge to walmarts supremacy in the discount market may have elicited derisive chuckles in some circles there were those who thought that if it could be done at all ulrich was the man to make it happen after several years of pressure from wall street ulrich announced in march  that target corporation was putting its marshall fields and mervyns divisions on the auction block both divisions operated department stores the earnings of which accounted for less than  percent of target corporations total annual revenue marshal cohen the chief analyst at npd group the marketinformation company based in port washington new york told janet moore of the minneapolis star tribune that the evolution of a leaner meaner target suggested that walmart might have been in for a rude awakening march   cohen predicted that target was going to aggressively pursue the walmart customer on the other hand the retailing analyst eric beder of northeast securities in new york seemed skeptical that target would fare well in a headtohead battle with walmart beder said that in contrast to managements portrayal of the company people are going to be a little surprised maybe when they clean off all these negatives to see that the target chain is not exactly that consistent growth vehicle march   the son of a m executive robert j ulrich was born in minneapolis minnesota in  he grew up in and around the twin cities and after high school enrolled at the university of minnesota from which he earned his bachelors degree in  fresh out of college ulrich joined a merchandising trainee program at dayton corporation the minneapolisbased operator of the upscale daytons department stores after completing training he advanced through the companys merchandising ranks in a series of positions of increasing responsibility posts held by ulrich included sales manager buyer group manager and divisional merchandise manager in  two years after ulrich joined dayton the company merged with the detroitbased jl hudson company to form dayton hudson corporation like daytons hudsons department stores catered to a more affluent market continues to climb ladder at dayton hudson by  ulrich had earned himself a vice presidency and the post of generalmerchandise manager for the daytons division of dayton hudson two years later after completing an executive training program at stanford university he was promoted to senior vice president for stores in  ulrich was named president and chief executive officer of diamonds department stores another division of dayton hudson that was later sold to dillards in early  he became one of three presidents at dayton hudson while his two copresidents were each responsible for regional groups of stores ulrich was charged with overseeing merchandising marketing and distribution for the entire chain later that same year ulrich was named president of dayton hudsons target stores division a chain of discount retail outlets that by the mids was generating annual revenues of more than  billion making it the companys largest operating division in  five years before ulrich joined the company daytons had opened its first target store in roseville minnesota the target outlets were daytons response to what it saw as a growing demand for brandname goods at discounted prices in a convenient shopping environment by the time ulrich assumed targets presidency in  the chain had grown to  stores and was already being widely described as an upscale discounter differentiating it from the other leading retail discounters such as walmart and kmart further distinguishing target from discount competitors was its early decision to refer to shoppers as guests much of the chains future growth and profitability would be predicated on just such distinctions under the direction of ulrich who in  was named chairman and ceo of the target division target stores more than doubled in number growing to a total of  by november  by the end of  that number had grown to  one of the first innovations in the target franchise during ulrichs tenure was the introduction of the greatland store sensing a strong consumer appetite for larger stores in the fall of  the upscale discount chain opened its first target greatland store in the minneapolis suburb of apple valley others soon followed the greatland stores differed from other targets in size they were typically  to  percent larger than traditional outlets the average target greatland covered roughly  square feet more than three football fields about half of the increased area was used for the display of additional merchandise with the remaining half used to create a feel of greater spaciousness allowing wider aisles a larger restaurant and more open areas ulrich faces off against walmart in the spring of  a classic davidversusgoliath confrontation came to a boil when ulrich fired back at walmart in response to marketing tactics he considered unfair walmart ran a series of ads misrepresenting target prices in markets served by both chains ulrich then launched a counteroffensive with ads headlined this never would have happened if sam walton were alive sam walton the founder of the larger chain had died in april  of walmarts ad campaign ulrich told womens wear daily  i believe customers are being misled by walmarts inaccurate price comparisons march   target contended that in some cases walmart had offered price comparisons on products not even available at the smaller chain with target contributing an increasingly large proportion of dayton hudsons total revenues it came as little surprise when in  ulrich was named to succeed the outgoing kenneth macke as chairman and ceo of dayton hudson corporation commenting on the differences between the marketing styles of macke and ulrich a twin cities retailing consultant familiar with both executives made an interesting observation when speaking to aron kahn of the st paul pioneer press  if they were at a lemonade stand that was running into competition macke would try to get the customers in by charging three cents instead of five and ulrich would try to get them in with two varieties of lemonade april   by the time ulrich took over the reins of the parent company dayton hudson was operating not only the dayton hudson and target outlets but also mervyns department stores acquired in  and marshall fields purchased in  as had been the case for more than a decade the target stores continued to contribute the biggest share of dayton hudson earnings in the mids ulrich introduced supertarget his answer to the giant retailing centers that had been launched earlier by walmart and kmart these supercenters blended the discounters regular displays of general merchandise with the food and grocery offerings of a fullservice supermarket targets first supercenter with  square feet of retailing space opened in omaha nebraska and was soon followed by others in the midwest target markets a hip image by the late s ulrichs campaign to carve out a special niche for target was winning praise from such distinguished american business publications as forbes and fortune  both of which profiled target in lengthy articles during the first half of  michelle conlin writing in the january   issue of forbes  observed that the chains stores had managed to market a hip image despite their discount prices some of targets success could be credited to the interchange of information between dayton hudsons department stores and its discount chain of targets success in attracting higherincome consumers to its stores ulrich told conlin our research shows that the higher the income the better educated the more the guests like to shop our stores january   in her profile of target in the may   issue of fortune  shelly branch wrote the image of target stores has gradually been transformed from typical discount chain to a hip store where even the rich and trendy can save money keeping the upscale discounter abreast of changing fashion trends and consumer tastes was a member trendmerchandising team the only such advisory panel of its kind in the discount business members of the team—affectionately called targeteers by the target designer michael graves—tracked trends visiting stores around the globe and tried wherever possible to anticipate the directions in which consumer tastes were headed ulrich told branch were constantly challenging our people to reinvent our guests have started to say hey its a lot more clever to shop at target than it used to be may   a critical element in ulrichs campaign to expand the target franchise was the chains edgy marketing campaign reporting on a february address to the  retail advertising conference by michael francis targets senior vice president of marketing lisa bertagnoli of womens wear daily described the chains multilevel strategy to generate buzz for its stores and merchandise the typical target customer according to company demographics was about  years of age and had a household income of  of its core constituency  percent had attended college  percent had children and  percent were female targets goal was to retain its core consumer base while increasing business with younger customers according to bertagnoli francis told the national retail federation–sponsored conference that the discounters future lay in the hands of trendsetters in terms of style haircuts tattoos body piercing—you name it february   targets bullseye nationally recognized targets efforts to make its bullseye trademark recognizable around the country got a solid vote of confidence in a brandawareness poll conducted in  poll results showed that  percent of all americans recognized and associated the redandwhite bullseye logo with target a higher level of recognition than the ralph lauren polo pony or even the nike swoosh when the good news was delivered to ulrich as francis reported at the conference the target ceo tasked his marketing chief to track down the remaining  percent of the populace and find out what the company was doing wrong and he wasnt kidding francis assured his audience february   reflecting targets dominant role in the financial fortunes of dayton hudson corporation on january   ulrich announced that the companys name henceforth would be target corporation at the time of the name change target stores accounted for a little over  percent of the corporations total revenue in announcing the name change according to an associated press report ulrich said target corporation is a more appropriate name for the company and is also a more widely recognized brand name january   a year later target consolidated its department store holdings folding its dayton and hudson department stores into the marshall fields division this reorganization left the company with three main retail divisions target mervyns and marshall fields as more and more pricesavvy americans turned to the socalled discounters to fill their consumer needs in the latter half of the s the contributions of targets departmentstore brands—mervyns and marshall fields—to the corporations bottom line shrank mervyns in particular fell upon hard times according to janet moore of the minneapolis star tribune  in a  presentation to security analysts ulrich laid out an ultimatum for mervyns he warned that the corporation would pursue alternative ways to generate shareholder value if the departmentstore chain failed to improve samestore sales over the following  to  months march   mervyns failed to deliver but ulrich was reluctant to act perhaps because of the intelligence the department stores offered target stores on changing consumer trends but in early  he could no longer ignore the decline in the department stores fortunes and announced that both mervyns and marshall fields would be put up for sale department stores share of profits shrinks as of early march  according to the minneapolis star tribune  mervyns had a total of  stores and  employees in fiscal  it had managed to post a pretax profit of  million on sales of  billion down from the pretax profit of  million in fiscal  marshall fields with  stores and  employees reported a pretax profit of  million on revenue of  billion in fiscal  off sharply from its fiscal  profit of  million in contrast target stores in fiscal  earned almost  billion before taxes up significantly from the nearly  billion of fiscal  revenues per square foot at target outlets edged up to  in fiscal  from  the previous year while revenues per square foot were down at both mervyns  down from  and marshall fields  down from  during the same period some security analysts speculated that target corporations stock would be likely to rise if it succeeded in selling off its departmentstore brands allowing it to focus exclusively on its successful target franchise spelling out his vision for target stores in the shortterm future ulrich projected in the companys  annual report that the discount chain would add  to  new stores in  for a net increase of  to  stores after taking into consideration closings and relocations ulrich also promised that targets new store design scheduled to be introduced in  would be more pleasant and inviting and promote our goal of being the preferred shopping destination for our guests on target full speed ahead ulrich was not without his critics his high level of compensation predictably drew fire from union workers protesting what they considered unfair treatment at the hands of target management at targets annual shareholders meeting in may  labor organizers handed out leaflets contrasting ulrichs  million compensation package with the reduced pay benefits and hours of store employees at about the same time ulrich was sharply criticized by corporate library one of the countrys leading shareholderadvocacy groups according to a report by neal st anthony in the minneapolis star tribune  corporate library gave targets ceo low marks for slipping out of the companys annual meeting without answering a single question from shareholders ulrich who was divorced lived in a lavish home in the minneapolis suburb of edina he had two grown children curt and jacqueline a member of the committee to encourage corporate philanthropy ulrich worked hard to see that target made a positive contribution to the communities in which it operated one of the corporations pet causes was education as exemplified by its take charge of education program which was launched in  under the program each week the company gave  million back to communities across america according to the companys web site portions of these funds are dedicated to specific education programs and initiatives created by target to directly improve funding for schools and opportunities for students community giving take charge of education ulrich also served on the board of the national retail federation and in early  received the
