was a decline in ratings and a loss of sponsorship resulting from many southern affiliates’ refusal to broadcast east side this explanation conveniently locates the bigotry behind the series’ cancellation with backward southern viewers rather than with the top brass of cbs but it doesn’t hold up to close scrutiny as edith efron pointed out in a  tv guide article east side  west side was dropped by no more affiliates in the south than in any other region of the country and ultimately only six percent of the potential viewing audience had the series blacked out in their areas it’s more likely that aubrey and his subordinates gave east side the axe because they were caught in a nowin situation they couldn’t allow the show to remain as openly liberal as it was for fear that the voluminous hate mail would scare off sponsors but they couldn’t eliminate the hotbutton elements of the series without endangering its critical cache and existing viewer loyalty had the show been a

was a decline in ratings and a loss of sponsorship resulting from many southern affiliates’ refusal to broadcast east side this explanation conveniently locates the bigotry behind the series’ cancellation with backward southern viewers rather than with the top brass of cbs but it doesn’t hold up to close scrutiny as edith efron pointed out in a  tv guide article east side  west side was dropped by no more affiliates in the south than in any other region of the country and ultimately only six percent of the potential viewing audience had the series blacked out in their areas it’s more likely that aubrey and his subordinates gave east side the axe because they were caught in a nowin situation they couldn’t allow the show to remain as openly liberal as it was for fear that the voluminous hate mail would scare off sponsors but they couldn’t eliminate the hotbutton elements of the series without endangering its critical cache and existing viewer loyalty had the show been a

was a decline in ratings and a loss of sponsorship resulting from many southern affiliates’ refusal to broadcast east side this explanation conveniently locates the bigotry behind the series’ cancellation with backward southern viewers rather than with the top brass of cbs but it doesn’t hold up to close scrutiny as edith efron pointed out in a  tv guide article east side  west side was dropped by no more affiliates in the south than in any other region of the country and ultimately only six percent of the potential viewing audience had the series blacked out in their areas it’s more likely that aubrey and his subordinates gave east side the axe because they were caught in a nowin situation they couldn’t allow the show to remain as openly liberal as it was for fear that the voluminous hate mail would scare off sponsors but they couldn’t eliminate the hotbutton elements of the series without endangering its critical cache and existing viewer loyalty had the show been a

was a decline in ratings and a loss of sponsorship resulting from many southern affiliates’ refusal to broadcast east side this explanation conveniently locates the bigotry behind the series’ cancellation with backward southern viewers rather than with the top brass of cbs but it doesn’t hold up to close scrutiny as edith efron pointed out in a  tv guide article east side  west side was dropped by no more affiliates in the south than in any other region of the country and ultimately only six percent of the potential viewing audience had the series blacked out in their areas it’s more likely that aubrey and his subordinates gave east side the axe because they were caught in a nowin situation they couldn’t allow the show to remain as openly liberal as it was for fear that the voluminous hate mail would scare off sponsors but they couldn’t eliminate the hotbutton elements of the series without endangering its critical cache and existing viewer loyalty had the show been a

was a decline in ratings and a loss of sponsorship resulting from many southern affiliates’ refusal to broadcast east side this explanation conveniently locates the bigotry behind the series’ cancellation with backward southern viewers rather than with the top brass of cbs but it doesn’t hold up to close scrutiny as edith efron pointed out in a  tv guide article east side  west side was dropped by no more affiliates in the south than in any other region of the country and ultimately only six percent of the potential viewing audience had the series blacked out in their areas it’s more likely that aubrey and his subordinates gave east side the axe because they were caught in a nowin situation they couldn’t allow the show to remain as openly liberal as it was for fear that the voluminous hate mail would scare off sponsors but they couldn’t eliminate the hotbutton elements of the series without endangering its critical cache and existing viewer loyalty had the show been a

edition cycling weekly george hincapie’s scott addict cycling weekly april   shares shares george hincapie has been riding shimanos electronic di this year but for the tough classics hes switching back to the mechanical dura ace  all is not well in the shimano camp and a complete swap to the  group is avoided with the older  rear mech the columbia mechanics feel the older cage design gives more security in preventing the chain dropping off the jockey wheels  makes another appearance with the cranks as these are the only shimano cranks able to accept the wireless srm a rear mounted wireless speed sensor keeps as much as possible out of the wind roughly taped to the rear rim is the wheel magnet not pretty but if it works another change for hincapie is a switch from his addict frame with integrated post to the nonintegrated version presumably for ease of saddle height adjustment and perhaps a little extra comfort continental pro edition competition mm tyres give the extra grip and comfort that are needed for the rough cobbles interestingly hincapie chose to run his hed carbonlite  carbon wheels over the cobbles for flanders and roubaix although his mechanics prepared fir st rims on dura ace hubs just in case hincapie is one of the few riders who rides with full deep section rims for the cobbled classics old  dura ace rear mech magnets taped onto rear rim and it’s last

george dewey scott at the age of eight his mother died and his father an executive at buick raised him in  he joined the united states marines and spent four years with them no doubt an inspiration for portraying general george s patton years later when scott left the marines he enrolled in journalism classes at the university of missouri but it was while performing in a play there that the acting bug bit him he has said it clicked just like tumblers in a safeit was in  that he landed a role in richard iii in new york city the play was a success and brought the young actor to the attention of critics he soon began to get work on television mostly in live broadcasts of plays and he landed the role of the crafty prosecutor in anatomy of a murder  it was this role that got him his first oscar nomination for best supporting actorhowever george and oscar wouldnt actually become the best of friends in fact he felt the whole process forced actors to become stars and that the ceremony was little more than a meat market in  he was nominated again for best supporting actor this time opposite paul newman in the hustler  but sent a message saying no thanks and refused the nominationhowever whether he was being temperamental or simply stubborn in his opinion of awards it did not seem to stop him from being nominated in the future anatomy and the hustler were followed by the clever mystery the list of adrian messenger  in which he starred alongside kirk douglas robert mitchum and cameos by major stars of the time including burt lancaster and frank sinatra its a mustsee directed by john huston with tongue deeply in cheekthe following year scott starred as general buck turgidson in stanley kubricks comical antiwar film dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb  this became one of his favorites and he often said that he felt guilty getting paid for it as he had so much fun making it another comedy followed the flimflam man  with scott playing a smoothtalking con artist who takes on an apprentice whom he soon discovers has too many moralsthree years followed with some smaller television movies before he got the role for which he will always be identified the aforementioned general patton in patton  this was a war movie that came at the end of a decade where antiwar protests had rocked a nation and become a symbol of youth dissatisfied with what was expected of them still the actors portrayal of this aggressive military icon actually drew sympathy for the controversial hero he won the oscar this time but stayed at home watching hockey insteada pair of films that he made in the early s were outstanding the first of these was the changeling  a film often packaged as a horror movie but one thats really more of a supernatural thriller he plays john russell a composer and music professor who loses his wife and daughter in a tragic accident seeking solace he moves into an archaic mansion that had been unoccupied for  years however a childlike presence seems to be sharing the house with him and trying to share its secrets with him from learning of the houses past he discovers its horrific secret of long ago a secret that the presence will no longer allow to be keptthen he starred  along with a young cast of then largely unknowns including timothy hutton sean penn and tom cruise  in the intense drama taps

grobel  who had conducted the famous interview with brando for playboy a year earlier  that marlon was not that good a player many years later christiane kubrick leveled the same charge against scott who was beaten regularly by her late husband stanley kubrick on the set of dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb  between setups however kubrick was renowned as a masterlevel chess player who used to hustle other players in his youth in new york city he joined the united states marines corps as a year old in  but the atomic bomb brought an end to world war ii before he could see combat after the war he served time at arlington national cemetery according to the march   time magazine coverstory on scott this was the time that he began to drink heavily as the grave detail was extremely depressing according to a time magazine coverstory march   scott once had to go back onstage during a broadway play with his hand in a rubber glove after punching the mirror in his dressing room the broken glass cut his hand and the flow of blood could not be stanched this was in the days of scotts heavy drinking which was caused by an innertorment and selfloathing scott had turned to acting to exorcise those demons and by the time of his success with patton  had largely succeeded according to the magazine profile an aficionado of acting he told interviewer lawrence grobel in his december  playboy magazine interview that his the hustler  costar paul newmans performance in that film was nothing special both actors were nominated for academy awards for their performances however he found newmans performance as the eponymous hud  to be a superb piece of acting he accepted the role of sheriff bill gillespie in in the heat of the night  according to producer walter mirischs memoir i thought we were making movies not history scott backed out when wife colleen dewhurst wanted him to direct her in a play on broadway mirisch then offered the role to rod steiger who accepted and won an oscar steiger later turned down the lead in patton  that went to scott which brought him an oscar during filming of the bible in the beginning  scott and ava gardner who had been in a tempestuous relationship for a few years drank heavily his drinking and his explosive temper resulted in scott beating gardner he broke her shoulder and during some of the filming she was in a body brace reprised his role as general george s patton in the television movie the last days of patton   years after his original portrayal which he won the oscar campaigned for

the period when he was harassing ava gardner george c scott found his clothes in the hotel room cut off at the shoulders ava gardner was still very close to frank sinatra who was himself very close to the mafia personal quotes  when asked for suggestions on how to judge acting i have three tests first which dominates the character or the actor with very few exceptions it should be the character second on film  as opposed to stage  were pretty much playing basic emotions love anger fear pity so the trick is whether you can come up with any fresh choices to present these common emotions third  and this is the quality that separates the great ones from the good ones  i look for a joy of performing quality who had that quality as much as anyone jimmy cagney james cagney the academy awards ceremonies are a twohour meat parade a public display with contrived suspense for economic reasons there is no question you get pumped up by the recognition then a selfloathing sets in when you realize youre enjoying it on psychoanalysis four visits i kept laughing i couldnt get serious if it helps you it helps you if standing on your head on the roof helps you it helps you  if you think so directors are supposed to help the audience good directors dont direct actors bette davis is my bloody idol i admire her more than any other film star i became an actor to escape my own personality acting is the most therapeutic thing in the world i think all the courage that i may lack personally i have as an actor i have nothing against oscar i know what he stands for and its terrific and i think when people used to hang around and pat each other on the back over a drink and dinner it was wonderful but when it became an international hoopla where careers lived and died on whether or not you did or didnt get an oscar then it got out of hand actors are the worlds oldest underprivileged minority  looked upon as nothing but buffoons one step above thieves and charlatans these award ceremonies simply compound the image for me my violent behavior is some sort of aberration a character defect im not particularly proud of acting changes the inner spirit its fulfilling but psychologically very costly you cant steal enough money in a lifetime to make up for the damage im ashamed for the bitterness it created in me but it exists even when youre successful its hard to rise above it its like a growth on acting it was the only avenue of escape i had from myself its never been difficult to subjugate myself to a part because i dont like myself too well acting was in every sense my means of survival film is not an actors medium you shoot scenes in order of convenience not the way they come in the script and thats detrimental to a fully developed performance theres the terrible tedium and boredom involved in waiting around for the camera to be set up and then you have to turn on and off when they do the scene over again when you see the rushes is the first time you begin to judge your performance if you get  of what you hoped for youre lucky i think you have to be schizoid three different ways to be an actor youve got to be three different people you have to be a human being then you have to be the character youre playing and on top of that youve got to be the guy sitting out there in row  watching yourself and judging yourself thats why most of us are crazy to start with or go nuts once we get into it i mean dont you think its a pretty spooky way to earn a living since childhood the whole selfloathing thing was a big part of my makeup now ive learned to say okay ive screwed up then i try to make amends for me the sexiest woman on the screen ever was joan blondell on paul newman ive never thought that paul was a particularly good actor hes one of the sweet people of the world an excellent producer but ive never been a paul newman fan as far as acting goes the only thing pauls ever done i really thought was first class was hud  on jack nicholson hes eccentric but very interesting a unique kind of approach he shines because hes himself a rather interesting eccentric a very fascinating actor early thoughts on patton  its an inadequate script and its very difficult for me patton was misunderstood contemporaneously and hes misunderstood here and im ashamed of being a part of it acting is just a matter of observation imitation and communication thats what its all about actors are always in trouble a director who isnt a help is a drag technique is making what is absolutely false appear to be totally true in a manner that is not recognizable the audience is a dark thing a peculiar animal an enemy that must be assaulted and won it doesnt matter a damn what the actor does or does not feel its what the lady down there in the blue hat is feeling on training to be an actor much of the learning process is finding out what not to do like indulging in excesses method acting where they all get together and act for each other in a testtube atmosphere on working with marlon brando on the formula  he would drive you crazy he does it over and over and over marlon would improve all the time im not sure about the rest of us on stanley kubrick he is most certainly in command and hes so selfeffacing and apologetic its impossible to be offended by him salary  east sidewest side   episode the day of the dolphin   against  of

scott hastings beckett “scotty” the little rascals our gang george robert phillips “spanky” mcfarland october   – june   was an american actor most famous for his appearances in the our gang series of shortsubject comedies of the s and s the our gang shorts were later popular after being syndicated to television as “the little rascals” early years mcfarland was born in dallas texas at methodist hospital in  to robert emmett and virginia mcfarland he had three siblings thomas “tommy” who himself appeared in a few our gang episodes as “dynamite” amanda and roderick “rod” prior to joining the our gang comedies buddy as he was called by his family modeled children’s clothing for a dallas department store and also was seen around the dallas area on highway billboards and in print advertisements for wonder bread this established “buddy” early on in the local public’s eye as an adorable child model and provided experience before cameras our gang in january  in response to a trade magazine advertisement from hal roach studios in culver city california requesting photographs of “cute kids” spanky’s aunt dottie virginia’s sister sent pictures from buddy’s portfolio an invitation for a screen test soon arrived which happened that spring leading to his acting career portions of spanky’s screen test are included in a  our gang entry aptly entitled spanky mcfarland’s nickname “spanky” is erroneously said to have arisen from warnings by his mother not to misbehave during one of the initial discussions with hal roach in his office as the story goes he had a habit of reaching out and grabbing things and on doing so his mother virginia would say “spanky spanky mustn’t touch” while this story has considerable folksy appeal spanky himself refuted the tale saying that the name was given by a los angeles newspaper reporter use of the “spanky” name by mcfarland for subsequent business or personal activities was expressly granted to mcfarland in one of his studio contracts in later years some in his family would affectionately refer to him as “spank” after his discovery at the age of three he instantly became a key member of the our gang children’s comedy movie series and one of hollywood’s stars his earliest films show him as an outspoken toddler grumpily going along with the rest of the gang his scenestealing abilities brought him more attention and by  he was the de facto leader of the gang often paired with carl “alfalfa” switzer and always the enterprising “idea man” switzer’s character became as much of a scene stealer as the young mcfarland was and the two boys’ fathers fought constantly over screen time and star billing for their children spanky mcfarland’s only starring featurefilm vehicle was the  hal roach film general spanky an unsuccessful attempt to move the our gang series into features he also appeared as a juvenile performer in many nonroach feature films including the wheeler  woolsey comedy kentucky kernels and two fritz lang features of the s following the  our gang short came the brawn mcfarland “retired” from our gang beginning a personal appearance tour in mid hal roach sold the our gang unit to metrogoldwynmayer who began casting for a new “team leader” character in spanky’s vein and ended up rehiring mcfarland himself he remained in the mgm our gang productions until his final appearance in the series unexpected riches in  at age thirteen later years in  at age  mcfarland joined the us air force upon his return to civilian life indelibly typecast in the public’s mind as “spanky” from our gang he found himself unable to find work in show business he took less glamorous jobs including work at a soft drink plant a hamburger stand and a popsicle factory in the late s when the our gang comedies were sweeping the nation on tv mcfarland hosted an afternoon children’s show “spanky’s clubhouse” on kotv television in tulsa oklahoma the show included a studio audience and appearances by other celebrities such as james arness and it ran little rascals shorts after that stint he continued at odd jobs – selling wine operating a restaurant and night club and selling appliances electronics and furniture he was selling for philcoford corporation where he advanced to national sales director after his selfdescribed “semiretirement” spanky loaned his name and celebrity to help raise money for charities primarily by participating in golf tournaments spanky also had his own namesake charity golf classic for  years held in marion indiana mcfarland continued to make personal appearances and cameo roles in films and television including an appearance on the tonight show starring johnny carson his final television performance was in  in an introductory vignette at the beginning of the cheers episode “woody gets an election” death mcfarland died suddenly of cardiac arrest on june   at age  his remains were cremated shortly thereafter in january  mcfarland posthumously joined fellow alumnus jackie cooper to become one of only two our gang members to receive a star on hollywood’s walk of fame scott hastings beckett “scotty” october   – may   was an

died in  beckett and moore both joined our gang our gang beckett appeared as a regular in the our gang short subjects series from  in the gang beckett played george “spanky” mcfarland’s best friend and partner in mischief his trademark look was a crooked black baseball cap and an oversized black sweater exposing one shoulder his role was taken over by carl “alfalfa” switzer in  and beckett left the series for features after that year beckett became a prolific child and young adult actor from the late s to the early s in  he returned to our gang briefly as alfalfa’s cousin wilbur in cousin wilbur and dog daze he appeared as one of the unborn children in shirley temple’s the blue bird  he also played al jolson as a teenager in the jolson story  with his singing voice being provided by fellow child actor rudy wissler his performance as jolson was described as “touching enchanting and to all indications accurate” life after our gang after his our gang days were over scotty won increasingly prominent roles in major hollywood films usually playing the star’s son or the hero as a boy among his major credits are dante’s inferno with spencer tracy anthony adverse with fredric march the charge of the light brigade with errol flynn conquest with greta garbo marie antoinette with norma shearer and kings row playing robert cummings as a child scotty attended los angeles high

suspicion of drunk driving the following year he eloped with beverly baker a tennis star but their marriage dissolved within a period of months a second marriage produced one son scott jr and this alliance seemed to last but in  he ran afoul of the law again once for passing a bad check and once for carrying a concealed weapon ironically that same year scotty’s career took an upward turn as he was cast as winky the comic sidekick in the popular tv show rocky jones space ranger this was to be his last major role he made only a few subsequent tv and film appearances some uncredited bit parts

medical attention after suffering a serious beating he died two days later at the young age of  although pills and a note were found no conclusion was made by the coroner as to the exact cause of
