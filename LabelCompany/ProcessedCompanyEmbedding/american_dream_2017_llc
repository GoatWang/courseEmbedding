ambition by cristina alesci   cristinaalesci february    am et howard schultz a childhood in the projects inspired his ambition in  a young boy from the brooklyn housing projects took a trip with his aunt to see the radio city rockettes it would change his life forever after the show they stopped to eat at the automat a fast food restaurant lined with banks of gleaming coinoperated vending machines the boy was fascinated how he wondered could you produce a piece of pie by dropping a quarter into the slot and pressing a button that boy was howard schultz who would grow up to create a business empire that revolutionized the way americans consume coffee she told me there was a magician on the other side schultz said of course i believed it the experience sparked a passion for bringing theater and romance to retail schultz now  is one of five influential leaders profiled in cnnmoneys the american dream new york their careers talents and individual narratives are all different but what unites them are a common origin and a passion for preserving the ability of future generations to rise like they did in addition to schultz the project features j crew ceo mickey drexler former xerox ceo ursula burns hiphop legend russell simmons and former federal research chairman alan greenspan each overcame adversity to achieve success beyond their highest hopes today the american dream is in question many americans believe it is too elusive to ever achieve and president donald trump effectively campaigned on the idea that it was dead and only he could revive it it remains to be seen how big of a difference washington politics and policies can make for now the lives of these five business leaders show the american dreams enduring power check out the full the american dream new york series here schultz grew up in the bayview houses a public housing project in canarsie brooklyn his familys hardscrabble existence in the lowrise buildings was a stark contrast to the glamor of midtown manhattan there was no way out my father was uneducated my mother wasnt working it was just a tough time as i got older i just felt really bad for them schultz said as a teenager schultz realized his athletic ability was his only ticket out a football scholarship at northern michigan university afforded him the escape hatch he desperately wanted after graduating he started a career in sales eventually landing a job at a maker of drip coffee machines one of his clients was a small seattle café called starbucks the rest is history starbucks ceo howard schultz says his childhood gave him the motivation to succeed in life for more on the american dream go to our american opportunity section like the other leaders profiled for the series schultz has achieved the american dream he regrets however missing the chance to tell his parents how much their struggle inspired his success i dont think i would have had the motivation the curiosity and the fear of failure if i didnt come from the background i have schultz said the most vulnerable thing i can say to you is i still have fear of failure today but he worries whether young people today have the same opportunity for advancement its a message hes been touting for years you cant have a society in which six million young people are disconnected because theyre not in school and theyre not working and everyone feeling as if its not my responsibility to help said schultz it is our collective responsibility as americans to lift everyone up schultz is stepping down from the helm of starbucks in april instead of running the company schultz will become executive chairman and focus on innovation premium offerings and most importantly social impact part of his mission helping to revive the american
