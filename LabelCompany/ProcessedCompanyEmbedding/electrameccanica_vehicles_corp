years of effort by some of the most talented people in the world and millions of dollars of resources to get the job done  the result is spectacular  you cannot buy a vehicle for this price anywhere in the world ever and get this level of happiness  not even close  i’m not even aware of any product you can acquire for that amount of money that could do what solo does” the final proof of course will be in the comments coming from our customers initially in british columbia who will be experiencing the solo in the real world using it as they commute deliver shop cruise…whatever i’m so proud

commentsin blog by adminfinally after years and years of planning designing building organizing and all the other things that go into an automotive launch we will begin our first vancouver area deliveries of our electra meccanica emv solo we believe it is best to have the first group of cars close to our operations center so we can keep tabs on the vehicles and assure that our customer experience is everything it should be  our social media squad will also be kept busy with sightings and reactions to the various solo cars freeranging in their natural habitat amongst traffic our solo reservation holders have been wonderfully supportive and patient as henry reisner and the team craft a car that will redefine how the world describes the word “automobile” it’s a big job and one that has been challenging and rewarding at the same time we will keep everyone updated on the specific delivery dates and customers will be contacted approximately  days prior to your delivery date for those who have yet to experience the solo we are planning on having two “preproduction” solo cars available for a test drive experience close to our vancouverbased production facility this will be a good chance for our reservation holders who can make it in to have their first taste of actually driving the solo my sales and marketing team will provide an exciting time for everyone including the media guests prior to taking the show on the road later this year we’ll share photos and video on our website and social channels and we’ll also post an event schedule for the test drive road show so stay tuned our new braid street assembly facility open house in april was a big success with guests joining us from all across north america we should be able to produce up to ten solos per month from this assembly line and then replicate and scale up for the proper volumes we need to deliver the  orders that we have on the books i anticipate many many more reservations coming from people who will be seeing our early adopters advocates and owners — our solo pilots — enjoying your new rides our company’s success will ultimately be determined by our overall production volume within the next  months so i assure you we are working on some worldclass plans for our current and future facilities this year’s vancouver auto show was a big success for us with the media in attendance reporting that emv “stole the show” with our exciting solo and solo r on day  of the event we also introduced our new allelectric convertible coupe called the tofino in less than a month after the reveal we have almost  orders for this gorgeous and innovative sports car the vehicle’s design and engineering team are progressing nicely and i hope to have something new to show you all by this september’s vancouver luxury and supercar show where we introduced the solo last year we have been running a path to complete our federal certification for the united states and canada the solo is scheduled to complete the required certification and compliance testing for us by the end of may following an additional  to  weeks of final compliance approval we expect the vehicle to be certified for use nationwide from there we can begin expansion into us markets with delivery of productionquality solos we can also begin with the implementation of solo intro stores in the us similar to those already established in the vancouver area i hope you and your families are enjoying a pleasant spring and getting ready to make the most of summer  i’ll provide a further update again next month and don’t forget we also have our regular live online updates at  pm pt on the first monday of each month on our facebook page details of that will continue to be emailed out to everyone as a reminder all the

vancouver auto show electra meccanica ceo update march   commentsin blog by adminmarch is a special month for electra meccanica as it is the time for the famous vancouver international auto show years ago i had just got my drivers license the day after my birthday on december th  and drove to the pacific national exhibition where the early editions of the vancouver auto show were held during the holiday season it was magical to drive the old  beetle to the show all by myself pay my three dollars to see the show and walk in like an adult and collect all the printed car brochures i loved the new bertone fiat x i was enchanted by someone who had made a recreation of the dark green jaguar d type with the vertical fin and leather strap over the bonnet but i was mostly transfixed by an amazing orange lamborghini countach lp with white interior on a raised eye level platform i stood there with my mouth open in disbelief behind me stood a couple of older people and one said to the other “only an idiot would want a car like that” i didn’t say a thing but i’m certain that everyone reading this knows what i thought of that opinion its that type of automotive magic that i’m reminded of each time we exhibit at the vancouver auto show and i wonder how many young people will walk down the aisle this year and see our exciting new  solo for the first time in real life and

will also have our amazing bright green solo r racing vehicle on display with acclaimed race driver scott hargrove making autograph appearances throughout the show you will see some amazing video of

downtown vancouver ceo report february  february   commentsin blog by admini have just returned from china where i toured the future home of our solo manufacturing facilities we will initially use these facilities for mass production of parts — and eventually for complete cars beginning later this year and into  our canadian production facilities in vancouver are great but they don’t have the capacity to fulfill the growing number of orders we will need to produce in a timely fashion or the ability to ship them around the world in a costeffective way   i have always been impressed by the efficiencies and scale of manufacturing in asia and our partners are some of the best on the planet they have worldclass quality control standards and a reputation for making some of the best vehicles for very large and wellknown global motoring companies it’s also encouraging to see the enthusiasm being applied now to clean energy vehicles — and in particular to the solo — as a way of disrupting the harmful effects of fossil fuel vehicles not only do governments “get it” but also now industry consumers and investors are making this a priority in their decisions we have truly passed a tipping point towards the closing down of harmful carbon emissions from fossil fuel   there are still some naughty companies coercing governments to allow for new fracking and pipelines but even they can see the writing on the wall   we are nearing the end of our initial preproduction run of ten solos and have been sorting out the build procedures and once complete i am looking forward to making the first customer deliveries soon if all goes to plan we will begin delivering the first of our preorders locally likely around the time of the vancouver auto show which runs from march april  once we have a number of customer cars happily driving around the vancouver area we’ll start sending them further afield and out of the country   i’m happy to say that our us compliance certification continues to move along and we will announce the results in due time   our advanced performance division is working hard on our amazing solo r race car for its upcoming debut in silicon valley we’ll have a private test at one of my favourite race tracks and provide video and details to you on the results of this first running   we’re targeting the third week of march for this so brace yourself not only will it be fast it’ll look amazing that’s what racing is all about right we may even consider making the solo r race car available to select clients who have the appropriate racing license   noisy race tracks are one of the biggest problems in the industry and solo is the ultimate solution now let’s see if it can pass the cars that currently make up the grids   our solo orders from individuals have now eclipsed  we’ve introduced a new program for people who have standing deposits on other cars the program allows those people to send their current deposit receipt to us and we’ll credit the full amount of the receipt towards the purchase of a solo you can check out smallevcom for more details we still also accept  as a fully refundable deposit on any one of the four colours of emv solo silver is now the most popular colour ordered with red and white close behind we’ll soon have a full running example of the solo in black when our preproduction  car is finished and we’ll get our marketing team to post images on our website and social media channels when ready kind of like a one person electric batmobile   february will see us opening up our first two solo intro stores in the vancouver area which will be replicated around the world i’m excited about getting the cars in front of people in high traffic areas it’ll create awareness and provide a platform for how best to stage future solo dealerships and retail outlets   speaking of high traffic please make plans to visit us at the vancouver auto show which will take place at the trade and convention centre from march april  i hope to display the freshly tested solo race car one or two shiny new solos and of course the solo chassis so people can see the magic that happens underneath the cool solo exterior i should be there every day along with the rest of our solo team show hours and other details will be posted on the emv website over the next few days and make sure to sign up for the emv newsletters   much much more to come in the next few weeks and months   see you soon   jerry kroll ceo electra meccanica vehicles httpselectrameccanicacomwpcontentuploadsemvpng   admin

solo intro stores and dealerships around the world appoints mark west as president from the desk of jerry kroll december   commentsin blog by admini recently went down to sonoma california to update my racing license in a formula  car at sonoma raceway aside from having a blast in the simraceway school cars i had a chance to drive a gasoline powered mercedesbenz rental from hertz i don’t usually drive gasoline cars so this gave me a chance to experience what today’s gas cars are like and compare it to our own solo electric car the weirdness of having a gasoline motor being turned on and idling is the first reminder that we’re back in the ’s there was a small “battery” logo on the dashboard that would charge up instantly and fully under any braking and then drain instantly on acceleration the other annoying thing was the internal combustion engine stopping and starting at every traffic light how do people find that pleasant i enjoy my analogy of gasoline cars being like fax machines and electric cars being the internet i’m more convinced of that now than ever and speaking of racing you can expect some interesting activity early in the new year as the electra meccanica emv “advanced performance team” takes to the track with our first few racing solos to me this is the best way to both develop our road car technology and to showcase the solo performance envelope i was twenty seconds a lap off the times of race prepared cars in the street stock solo so with some tweaking racing slicks and some other top secret tweaks i would suggest you don’t put your ferrari out there with us until after you’ve seen a few passes the racing solo team will be introduced at a trade event early in the new year the busiest department currently at electra meccanica is our production team who have settled into our newly expanded production facility in new westminster british columbia i’ve driven the first preproduction solos one of which has gone to complete us federal compliance and certification testing i expect us to complete preproduction by the end of the year and get right into production for those of you who are eagerly awaiting your cars they perform wonderfully and are super eyecatching in traffic our marketing team is looking forward to taking photos of all of you as you get your keys and drive off in your new solo and so am i  will likely be the most profound year in the history of electra meccanica so much work has been done so much is ready to roll out in the way of cars dealerships and general corporate development lots of work ahead and i’m excited by what we’ll do and where we’ll be in december  we have booked emv to be at the vancouver auto show from march th to april nd and we’ll announce other exhibits around the world as they are confirmed on behalf of everyone at electra meccanica i sincerely thank you for your interest and support and i look forward to meeting you in person in the new year–and watching your first drives in your very own solo happy holidays and the best for  jerry kroll ceo electrameccanica vehicles corp httpselectrameccanicacomwpcontentuploadsemvpng   admin
