interference and breach of fiduciary duty cited a public conversation between vikram chandra ceo of ndtv and martin sorrell ceo of wpp in which chandra had described ways in which the system was prone to tampering and bribery his request for a halt to the publication of the allegedly compromised data was unsuccessful wpp responded that the lawsuit had not been served on wpp or any of its operating companies the new york court had no jurisdiction in the case and that it would file for dismissal seeking legal costs and that it was considering a lawsuit against ndtv for defamation a threat which ndtv in turn called baseless the motion to dismiss was filed a week later with the statement in its memorandum of law that this case is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the plaintiff a television station in new delhi india to drum up media coverage in india to divert attention from the real reasons its programmes have had low audience ratings and its financial performance has been abysmal for five years  new delhi tv has crossed the globe and come to new york state supreme court to complain about an indian company tam and how it measures the ratings of television programmes in india the motion to dismiss is to be decided by the court on  december  nielsen later filed its own petition for dismissal writing that ndtv attempts to transform a potential contract claim against tam into tort and oral contract claims against the nielsen defendants nothing in the law supports such a magic trick simply put ndtv fails to allege a legal duty independent of a contract and fails to

of shareholder revolts over executive pay having already happened at other public companies agms earlier in the year the media coverage of martin sorrells intended £m pay packet drew increasing public attention the result was a  shareholder vote to reject the resolution taxationedit it has been reported that wpp goes to great lengths to lower its own corporate tax bill the guardian reported that between  and  the company paid £m in uk corporation tax compared to what the newspaper might expect based on reports of the firm making  of its profit in the uk of around £m television audience measurementedit in  the indian broadcasting ndtv filed a lawsuit against television audience measurement tam a joint venture of the former competitors nielsen and kantar media research which for years has provided the only tv audience measurement system in india wpp plc was listed among the defendants as the holding group of kantar and imrb ndtvs lawsuit filed in the new york state supreme court under the foreign corrupt practices act and seeking  billion for negligence and hundreds of millions for interference and breach of fiduciary duty cited a public conversation between vikram chandra ceo of ndtv and martin sorrell ceo of wpp in which chandra had described ways in which the system was prone to tampering and bribery his request for a halt to the publication of the allegedly compromised data was unsuccessful wpp responded that the lawsuit had not been served on wpp or any of its operating companies the new york court had no jurisdiction in the case and that it would file for dismissal seeking legal costs and that it was considering a lawsuit against ndtv for defamation a threat which ndtv in turn called baseless the motion to dismiss was filed a week later with the statement in its memorandum of law that this case is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the plaintiff a television station in new delhi india to drum up media coverage in india to divert attention from the real reasons its programmes have had low audience ratings and its financial performance has been abysmal for five years  new delhi tv has crossed the globe and come to new york state supreme court to complain about an indian company tam and how it measures the ratings of television programmes in india the motion to dismiss is to be decided by the court on  december  nielsen later filed its own petition for dismissal writing that ndtv attempts to transform a potential contract claim against tam into tort and oral contract claims against the nielsen defendants nothing in the law supports such a magic trick simply put ndtv fails to allege a legal duty independent of a contract and fails to allege all of the elements needed to support each cause of action referencesedit

billion for negligence and hundreds of millions for interference and breach of fiduciary duty cited a public conversation between vikram chandra ceo of ndtv and martin sorrell ceo of wpp in which chandra had described ways in which the system was prone to tampering and bribery his request for a halt to the publication of the allegedly compromised data was unsuccessful wpp responded that the lawsuit had not been served on wpp or any of its operating companies the new york court had no jurisdiction in the case and that it would file for dismissal seeking legal costs and that it was considering a lawsuit against ndtv for defamation a threat which ndtv in turn called baseless the motion to dismiss was filed a week later with the statement in its memorandum of law that this case is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the plaintiff a television station in new delhi india to drum up media coverage in india to divert attention from the real reasons its programmes have had low audience ratings and its financial performance has been abysmal for five years  new delhi tv has crossed the globe and come to new york state supreme court to complain about an indian company tam and how it measures the ratings of television programmes in india the motion to dismiss is to be decided by the court on  december  nielsen later filed its own petition for dismissal writing that ndtv attempts to transform a potential contract claim against tam into tort and oral contract claims against the nielsen defendants nothing in the law supports such a magic trick simply put ndtv fails to allege a legal duty independent of a contract and fails to allege all of the elements needed to support each cause of action referencesedit  a b c preliminary results  pdf wpp plc retrieved  april
