chang of hellmanchang eric chang of brooklynbased furniture line hellmanchang answers our questions on their handcrafted wood furniture by new york spaces dan hellman  eric chang nys how and when did you both meet and decide to start hellmanchang eric chang of hellmanchang dan and i met in the th grade at the age of  we quickly became best friends and learned we shared a lot of interests beyond the same circle of friends this included things like art design tropical fish and most importantly gradeschool woodshop we ended up getting more involved in the craft when we bought woodworking books and started teaching ourselves how to build solidwood furniture in dans dads garage during the summers of high school and college it wasnt until we both lived in new york after graduating college that we reminisced about our woodworking days and decided that we would pursue the hobby again shortly thereafter hellmanchang was born we found a listing on craigslist for a shared coop woodworking studio where we could rent a x square foot space that we could go to on weeknights and weekends we would meet up after work and build furniture in the shop until one in the morning every night and all day on saturdays and sundays after a couple of months of designing and building our own pieces we realized that this was becoming a very expensive hobby to have and thats when we decided to make a business out of it a brand developed along with a design language and we ended up winning a best of year award with interior design magazine after its publication our first client the four seasons hotel called  and we suddenly had an order for  pieces for their new seattle hotel thats when we knew we had developed something with legs nys what were your respective backgrounds eric chang of hellmanchang we are both selftaught in design i went to new york universitys stern school eric chang of business and studied finance and marketing dan went to northwesterns school of music and majored in classical guitar performance nys what was the goal you had in mind when you began your luxury furniture line eric chang of hellmanchang the goal has always been to design the most beautiful clean simple yet timeless furniture in the world while building the finestmade furniture in the world what our clients found interesting was that it is all made in brooklyn new yorknot a location synonymous with those characteristics we had fallen in love with the traditional handcrafted process of woodworking back in those days as teenagers in the garage when we started building furniture for clients we never wanted to stray from that process each hellmanchang piece is built with passion and integrity of the craft simply as a result of that uncompromising craftsmanship our pieces were labor intensive and built from quality materials and therefore had to demand a high price point and fall within the luxury market nys what kind of oldworld techniques do you use when creating your handcrafted furniture eric chang of hellmanchang we use as much solid wood as we can and where it makes sense and traditional joinery techniques like mortiseandtenon which is meant to last for generations much of the dynamic shaping you see in our lines which were known for are also cut and sculpted by hand with oldworld handtools like spoke shaves rasps and handplanes nys where do you craft your furniture eric chang of hellmanchang our furniture is madetoorder and benchmade in our  square foot brooklyn studio sternum chaise by don howell for hellmanchang nys what are the advantages of working in a space that also houses a woodworkers coop eric chang of hellmanchang when dan and i started out in the woodworking coop we were a couple of young guys sharing space and learning from other artists woodworkers and cabinetmakers it was an invaluable experience and a wonderful environment to cut our teeth and make longlasting friendships when we started our own studio we felt it was important to dedicate a space to a similar coop doing so has allowed us to remained immersed in the creative energy that has defined brooklyn in the past few years its great to exchange ideas see new things and continue to grow those relationships as well as help foster young talent our new sternum chaise was a great byproduct of our coop a talented craftsman don howell was a member and created this beautiful piece on his own that we then took into our linea first for hellmanchang nys where do you source your materials do you ever base your designs on what materials are more readily available eric chang of hellmanchang most of our vendors and suppliers are in the new york area we have a lumber supplier in the bronx and our metal and glass vendors are down the street from us we do have another lumber supplier in ohio but most of the woods are north american hardwoods we try to stay away from anything exotic and endangered the materials themselves do not dictate our designs but they do influence our finishes which is something weve become known for as well our woods include american black walnut white oak and sapele and we now have  different finishes in those species each wood has its own natural characteristics of grain pattern and tones i usually pull inspiration from the fashion industry to then develop new colors and stains that can work on these individual wood species nys what are some of the design aspects unique to hellmanchang eric chang of hellmanchang there are dynamic lines and handcut surfaces and facets that create a sense of movement in our pieces that are recognizable in our line theres an emotional connection we try to create as people are usually drawn to want to touch these surfaces we design with a strong sense of proportion and negative space with pieces that can change drastically as you view from different angles our pieces often grow on you spending more time with them always reveals things you hadnt noticed earlier z pedestal table nys what are your favorite pieces respectively why so eric chang of hellmanchang the z pedestal is my favorite because that was the piece that started it all we won recognition for it from the best of year award and instantly started getting requests to grow it into a full range of new product offerings my favorite piece in that line would be the z quad dining table which is a very dynamic large table with very sleek and memorable lines lin extension dining table nys do you do custom work commercial work do you work with the trade eric chang of hellmanchang we are sold through the trade exclusively and nearly all of the pieces we sell are customized in some way our pieces are considered major investment pieces to our clients like a madetomeasure tailored suit we make sure that each piece is exact to the clients individual needs thats why interior designers are so important to us and to the endclient we have a wide range of options for each of our pieces and designers help ensure the end result is perfect this includes both private residential and commercial clients nys is there a commercial space outfitted with designs from hellmanchang eric chang of hellmanchang there are a number of executive and ceo offices lobbies and conference rooms outfitted with our pieces as well as a number of luxury hotels including the four seasons ritz carlton waldorf astoria mandarin oriental intercontinental the cosmopolitan and the setai to name a few nys what is a design you are working on now that has you both excited eric chang of hellmanchang im most excited about our new seating pieces including our tao lounge chair that incorporates our trademark focus on negative space and also features a strong geometric sensibility which is softened through the luxurious upholstery z quad dining table nys your furniture line includes many modern yet industrial pieces what draws you both to the combination of woods and metals eric chang of hellmanchang our foundation has always been solid woodthe process we originally fell in love with theres a romance history and story to solid wood that everyone can relate to and it cannot be replicated by any other material in the world one of the great things about wood is its versatility and ability to work well with other materials like glass stones and metals the natural touch of wood becomes accentuated and highlighted when it comes in contrast with the other industrial materials mixing elevates the beauty of everything nys where do you see hellmanchang in the future eric chang of hellmanchang weve been fortunate enough that the hellmanchang brand has grown associations larger than furniture it will allow us to grow into including all things beautiful for the home  including lighting fabrics textiles and table top we are excited to see where the company and our clients take us nys where can we find you eric chang of hellmanchang we are found in designer showrooms around the country in new york los angeles chicago san
