over to chris christopher j sobecki  weight watchers international inc thanks corey and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today i will discuss our first quarter performance and successful winter season nick will then provide further detail on our financial results and our improved outlook for the year and thilo will wrap up with an overview of our progress todate but before discussing the results id like to start by highlighting last weeks announcement that mindy grossman will be joining weight watchers in july as ceo mindy is coming from hsn where she has been ceo since  under her leadership hsn transformed into a lifestyle network launched industryleading digital innovations and formed unique partnerships with leading brands and personalities she is widely recognized as a business leader and innovator mindys outstanding track record in executing business transformations her bold innovative thinking and her understanding and focus on the customer experience make her the perfect leader to unlock weight watchers full potential now turning to the first quarter performance in q we continued to build on last years recruitment momentum and delivered the best quarter in recent times q global member recruitment was up in the double digits on top of doubledigit growth in last years first quarter with good performance at our meetings business and particular strength in online as nick will discuss this momentum translated into revenue growth of  on a constant currency basis and with our highmargin business model this strength flowed through to the bottom line q was the sixth consecutive quarter of positive yearoveryear member recruitment end of period subscribers increased  over the prior year to  million with meeting end of period subscribers up  to  million and online end of period subscribers up   to  million total paid weeks were up  in q with meetings up  and online up  north america our largest market delivered good performance in q in both meetings and online in addition to the continued improvements were making to our products and services we are continuing to refine our promotional strategies and strengthen our capabilities and execution across all areas of our marketing mix including broadcast digital and social channels weight watchers continues to benefit from oprah winfreys involvement examples include the significant media coverage we received during the winter season in north america with great interest in her success in the program as well as her cookbook titled food health and happiness beyond celebrating oprah and other members success in our us winter season tv campaign we also launched a new subscriber feature which we call connecting with oprah where she inspires and engages with members now turning to international as we discussed on our last call we are applying many of the key learnings that were fundamental to turning around north america to our international markets and im happy to report that it is working our international performance has markedly improved versus last year in addition to benefiting from the same product improvements that are helping north america our teams are doing a great job in better optimizing the visitor site experience in these markets rolling out effective marketing campaigns and promotional programs continental europe delivered strong member recruitments in q primarily driven by growth in online while q member recruitment in the uk remained down yearoveryear online member recruitment was positive the uk team supported with key global resources is highly focused and we are taking steps to begin to turnaround this business in the uk let me close my section by saying the entire weight watchers team is excited that mindy will be joining to lead this company going forward she will bring vision and passion for where we can go and what we can be on behalf of the board i also want to thank everyone across our global businesses who have worked tirelessly over the last few years to turn this business around versus where we were our program is better our digital products are better our meeting experience is better and our members recognizing it and theyre benefiting from it on many many dimensions our teams are executing better and more consistently and our improving results reflect those efforts overall with two strong winter seasons in a row we have strong momentum heading into the rest of  to sustain this momentum we remain focused on member experience fast action and engagement while its too early to a have read into the spring season as our advertising campaigns just kicked off we are confident in our marketing approach our campaigns are based on recent learnings highlight living a joyful life in weight watchers invoke the power of the weight watchers community our proven program foundational capabilities and strong reputation for efficacy and trust provide us with immense opportunities to further advance our offerings and brand in the years ahead ill now like to pass it to nick nicholas p hotchkin  weight watchers international inc thanks chris q was a strong quarter on a yearoveryear basis revenue was up  on constant currency paid weeks grew  and end of period subscribers increased  its great to see such positive momentum in the business and we are intensely focused on delivering sustainable growth throughout  and beyond for those of you who are newer to our story id like to take a moment to explain our business model specifically the lag from recruitment growth to revenue growth and the flowthrough to the bottom line using the us as an example our typical customer joins with a three months commitment and receives a discount for that initial period followed by monthly renewals that are full rate in the us  a month for meetings or  a month for online our average retention or length of stay is eight to nine months we are a seasonal business with approximately  of our annual member recruitment and a disproportionate amount of annual marketing expense occurring in the first quarter as such q bears the lions share of the cost of attracting new members that captures only a portion of the associated revenue given solid member recruitment growth throughout  we ended  with  more subscribers than the prior year this tailwind entering  combined with strong member recruitments in winter  generated q revenue of  million up  or  million on a constantcurrency basis and operating income of  million up  million versus prior year on a constantcurrency basis this reflects the operating leverage in our business model and the low incremental cost to serve new recruits gaap eps was  which included a net benefit of  related to the previously announced cessation of operations in spain this reflected a tax benefit of  per share offset by  per share of related expense for reference in the prioryear first quarter gaap eps was a loss of  going into  we are focused on maintaining momentum in north america and improving its national performance we are successfully delivering on these goals in q on a yearoveryear basis north america revenue increased  on constant currency and end of period subscribers increased  in continental europe led by our largest markets germany and france revenue increased  on constant currency and end of period subscribers increased  in the uk while revenue declined  on constant currency due to continued weakness in the meetings business end of period subscribers increased  primarily due to online subscriber growth and now id like to update our outlook for  we expect revenue momentum will continue to build throughout the year with online growing faster than meetings with fullyear  revenue north of  billion note that  includes an expected negative foreign exchange revenue impact of  million we are raising our fullyear gaap eps guidance to a range of  to  reflecting the strong q performance and our continued confidence for the year for the remainder of my comments i will speak to the midpoint of our fullyear eps range and on a constantcurrency basis in north america we expect fullyear revenues to be up in the lowdouble digits reflecting continued momentum in the uk we now expect fullyear revenue to be down in the lowsingle digits and for ce we now expect fullyear revenue to be up in the mid to highsingle digits reflecting cost efficiencies at higher volumes and strongerthananticipated q performance we now expect gross margin to expand approximately  basis points for the full year this reflects improved operating leverage partially offset by investments in product development and a lower contribution from licensing we continue to balance investments in growth initiatives with cost discipline marketing expense is expected to be approximately  million for the full year and ga expense is also expected to be approximately  million for the year below the line for the year we expect interest expense to be approximately  million and we are assuming a tax rate of approximately  for the full year which incorporates the spain tax benefits we expect capex primarily driven by tech spend and capitalized software to be consistent with prioryear levels at approximately  million and da is expected to be  million we continue to have a strong liquidity position we ended the quarter with  million in cash and no draw on the revolver and for the full year we expect ebitdas north of  million as a reminder our  billion b term loan is not due until  our debt has no financial leverage covenants and we have the ability to prepay before maturity as discussed previously we are targeting a net debt to ebitdas ratio of less than  times by year end  with that i would like to turn it over to thilo thilo semmelbauer  weight watchers international inc thanks nick its great to see the benefits from the many enhancements and changes weve made now coming to fruition an increased focus on consumer insights informed many of the improvements weve made from the meeting room to our digital products from sign up and on boarding to ongoing engagement in addition our partnership with oprah has greatly accelerated our progress she is a passionate member and a strong strategic voice for the company our strong online performance in q with paid weeks up  yearoveryear coupled with the strong online usage and engagement metrics that were seeing validates our offerings in a market filled with countless free apps in addition were pleased to see the strength of online across most of our international markets it gives us confidence in our technology strategy which combines a vastly improved global technology platform with localization and customization the agile process thats now in place is all about continuous improvement incorporating feedback from our members testing and rolling out enhancements and new features over a year ago we marked a major evolution in the weight watchers program with the launch of beyond the scale which inspires and guides members to eat better move more and start to shift their mindset this holistic approach is resonating with consumers and importantly it is delivering improved weight loss success we will continue to enhance and evolve our program under this healthy lifestyle approach finally and as chris mentioned were excited that mindy grossman will be joining as weight watchers ceo in july until then chris nick and i are fully engaged working with the weight watchers team on delivering our plan to improve the member experience and accelerate member growth id also like to take a moment to thank the entire weight watchers team the progress weve made is the direct result of your dedication and shared passion in helping transform the lives of people around the world through weight loss and healthier living and i believe the best is yet to come to those on the call thank you for joining us today and well turn the call to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session the first question comes from alex fuhrman from craighallum please go ahead alex joseph fuhrman  craighallum capital group llc great thanks so much for taking my question and congratulations on another terrific diet season id love to start by asking i mean obviously the big news this month is mindy grossman joining weight watchers as ceo i think that was certainly a positive surprise to most people when we saw this – wed love to get just a little bit of background on how that came to be obviously anyone whos looked at hsn closely knows mindy has been there a tremendously long time would be curious how you were able to get her to join weight watchers and then looking out to her start in july i mean obviously the company has made tremendous progress over the past year or yearandahalf i mean doesnt seem like there are really any fires that need to put out or crises to be dealt with you know wed be wondering what you might anticipate mindy will have on her plate in terms of projects when she starts with the company in july what some of the things that she might look to be working on this year before the end of  and then i suppose as a related question as you look ahead to diet season  at what point in the year would you normally expect to have your marketing plans finalized christopher j sobecki  weight watchers international inc this is chris alex thank you for your questions maybe just starting with – you asked for some color on the process let me start by saying that the board entered this process really for the first time certainly since weve been involved with the idea of going outside and finding the best possible candidate and i think the establishment of the office for the ceo was meant to provide stability and leadership in this interim period so it wasnt going to be any time pressure in terms of the process so the process was thorough it was – we had the fortunate that attracted a lot of interest we saw a lot of terrific candidates but at end of the day mindy was the boards number one pick and we were fortunate enough to – that she was excited about the opportunity i think were aligned with her and we have – weight watchers as a company is – were only touching a very small fraction of the market that were going after and i think what we see and what she sees is the opportunity now that we have a solid foundation we have positive mix and we have a pipeline of innovation thats there is how do we take this company forward and move it to a whole new level i think were excited she is excited and i think we are fortunate to end up with a terrific person to lead this company going forward so she is going to start in july as you mentioned id rather not go in – i am going to let her speak for herself when she arrives in terms of what her areas of focus will be and so on so ill let her speak for herself specifically on that point when she arrives and youre right were not fighting a kind of fires right now so im sure she will engage and she has certainly ideas of where she wants to take the company as far as the diet season  the planning it has been and continues underway i mean we certainly believe we know – we know where were going theres a lot of work to be done but these are things that the day we – by the time we get to january  of  were ready working what were going to do in  so were excited about where were going and i guess ill stop there alex joseph fuhrman  craighallum capital group llc great thats terrific thats certainly very helpful the other thing i wanted to ask about just looking at the results it seems like the uk business particularly online has really rapidly looks like hit an inflection point just wondering if there was any specific thing driving that a significant change to how you do business over there or maybe your marketing program for this year do you think that maybe youre starting to take some market share back in the uk or not sure it may be too soon to make that call but just wondering what is driving the pretty quick inflection point there in the online business in the uk christopher j sobecki  weight watchers international inc i think one thing i think thilo spoke to on the call i think the whole digital – were doing well in online across the board including the uk i think the digital product – the experience to our members improved significantly over the last year or so i think thats certainly part of it when you have a better product people are going to be more receptive to it i think weve begun to take some early steps in terms of improvement execution on the marketing side in the uk i think thats certainly a driver weve spoken in the past the uk is a little bit but unique situation that we have a longtime entrenched meetings competitor in the uk and we obviously as we mentioned in our remarks we are focused on turning around not only the online business but the meeting business as well but i think the online is kind of a leading indicator of where were going thilo semmelbauer  weight watchers international inc yeah this is thilo ill just follow up on online a little bit i think were pleased with the performance the paid week is up  globally with online why is it i think the bottom line its a much better product than a year ago weve made improvements not only in conversion from the visitor side but in onboarding new users to learn the program and our tools its easier to track its easier to find recipes for our members we now have a streaming platform for video which were using for connecting with oprah so theres been a tremendous improvement in the stability so the result is that the ratings of our apps in the u s and in other markets are consistently now  stars to  stars where a year ago it was much lower and while we dont disclose our engagement metrics were really seeing strong engagement with the product so thats very gratifying and i think again it shows that the value proposition of our offering is very sound alex joseph fuhrman  craighallum capital group llc thats very helpful thank you very much operator the next question comes from frank camma with sidoti please go ahead frank camma  sidoti  company llc good afternoon guys and congratulations just a couple of quick ones just a followup on the online did you see any change in sort of the demographic of your customer on the online that you can talk about from years past christopher j sobecki  weight watchers international inc this is chris i dont think were seeing any dramatic shift in the demographics i think we spoke in the past we have a lot of efforts underway as we look to shift those demographics – for example go after the millennials but we have a lot of millennials i think a lot of that work is still due to come and certainly its not driving our first quarter frank camma  sidoti  company llc interesting and on pricing because you made the comments about the pricing with discounting and stuff which you obviously always do in the beginning of the year but can you talk about what you expect sort of over time as those discounts – do you expect to kind of push the discounting as hard this year or do you feel that the offering can sell itself so wondering if you can just talk about that a little bit nicholas p hotchkin  weight watchers international inc hey frank its nick its a good question when i look at the q versus our expectations i was pleased that it was driven by revenue coming in a bit higher than wed anticipated and part of that was a strong march part of that was product sales were good but part of it was also team really focusing on good price realization so were pleased with our price realization in the first quarter were very focused on it going through the year it was part of what allowed such a high percentage of our revenue growth to flow through to the bottom line and when we look at our pricing equation its about giving people a reason to go from contemplating starting a journey to taking action and the team globally has just done great work on creating what we call urgency moments which arent necessarily high economic discounts but innovative ways to get people to think about engaging with weight watchers and weve got good plans for that to continue this year frank camma  sidoti  company llc okay good and my last question is just on the marketing spend since it was little less than i had modeled is that because you think youve got more effective spending or you just pulled back a little bit just wondering if you can just talk about that in general just a level of spending relative to the revenue nicholas p hotchkin  weight watchers international inc yeah obviously marketing spend very important for us in the first quarter where we get about  of our recruits so we were very very visible and we wind up spending essentially the same amount as we spent last year despite january  and january  falling in this fiscal year and adding a week to our winter campaign i think that gets to all the work that team is doing maximizing our marketing efficiency and optimizing channels digital and ecrm and particularly in q were working well for us frank camma  sidoti  company llc great thanks guys operator the next question comes from rj hottovy with morningstar research please go ahead rj hottovy  morningstar inc research thanks i had a followup question on the earlier question about demographics and expanding the reach possibly there wanted to see if you have any thoughts about as online has been growing faster about maybe pushing the envelope a little bit harder on that and whether or not that success you had there made you rethink your capital allocation policies versus online versus meetings to maybe go after that market a little bit more aggressively obviously with the new ceo coming in some of this may change with her insight but just wanted to see preliminary what you are doing more aggressively to reach out there what are the most nearterm milestones youre looking forward to reach a wider demographic nicholas p hotchkin  weight watchers international inc yeah rj thanks for that let me start i mean i just want to stress that not only was q a strong quarter it was a balanced quarter also so recruits were positive in both online and meetings and bear in mind that the meetings business was particularly strong last winter season so good to see within that  global paid weeks growth  meetings growth and  online growth so it was a strong but a balanced quarter and of course much improved digital presence and online tools used by our meeting members also so its been a really great add to the brand i think going forward we clearly have opportunities to have weight watchers appeal to a younger audience rj hottovy  morningstar inc research thanks and just my followup – my next question – just had to do on your latest thoughts on your wearables strategy and just kind of where we stand with that i know theres sort of lot of partnerships signed the last couple of years and just kind of latest thoughts on whats working what might not be working and just generally broadly speaking what your latest thoughts are on your wearables partnerships christopher j sobecki  weight watchers international inc i mean we – many of our members are tied to activity monitors i mean we have a – and we connect – our apps will connect with i think most of the leading activity monitors out there and it ties into the app and helps them track fitpoints and i think we feel that for many people an activity monitor tied to our program is big benefit to them so thats – that continues to be the case and were tying those through – with approaches and tieins with a number of those providers and our members choose which route they want to go thilo semmelbauer  weight watchers international inc yeah this is thilo following up on what chris said its highly complementary to our offering for those members that find wearables helpful we also believe that wearables by themselves are not the solution and we see more and more of our members frankly doing both operator this concludes the questionandanswer session and the conference has also now concluded thank you for attending todays presentation
