echevarria secretary                       letter from the founder   march     with the support of our shareholders algodon group otcqb vino has created an emerging luxury brand featuring a number of exciting projects under the algodon® umbrella have you visited the vineyards and winery of algodon wine estates in the heart of argentina’s wine country in san rafael mendoza our property there includes  acres  hectares of vines dating back to  as well as a  acre  hectare luxury real estate development with over  estate lots ranging from  to  acres that bucolic spot features the algodon wines  wellness resort a developing premier wine wellness culinary and sport resort that includes golf and tennis facilities have you tasted or bought some of our algodon fine wines several of which have received numerous international accolades have you tried algodon’s awardwinning olive oil sourced directly from the estate have you been able to spend a few nights at the beautiful algodon mansion our allsuite boutique hotel located in the fashionable heart of buenos aires’ luxury residential and embassy district   clearly algodon wines  luxury development group inc is growing up but we know we have a long way to go and we think we are in a good place to do so   along with much of the investment community we believe argentina is finally emerging from its long economic slump and is already on a path toward significant growth the election in  of argentina’s new president mauricio macri seemed to presage a new economic era in argentina and caused many to take a fresh new look at all that argentina has to offer from the earliest days of his presidency the global financial press has widely reported an abundance of positive news regarding argentina’s economic forecast and investment potential highlighting argentina as one of the best places to invest in  and beyond we at algodon have been focusing on argentina for about ten years and it’s clear that we are no longer alone in our thinking in january  for example morgan stanley forecast that argentina’s stock market could “rocket” their word not mine as much as  in five years   the challenge we now face is this while we have acquired and developed significant real estate assets and are starting to see the fruits of our hard work we have begun to think and plan bigger than we have in the past we are very happy with our substantial real estate holdings as last year was a huge positive for real estate values in argentina we are also pleased that our wines are just now beginning to sell in the us and so on but as a public company we are now thinking bigger with a focus on further expanding our customer base as we seek to become the louis vuitton moët hennessy lvmh of south america with our new perspective we now find ourselves with the ability to “scale” on a significant and global basis as it relates to significant long term business expansion revenues and ultimately our market capitalization so as a public company we now have two important and specific goals first we want to elevate our company’s shares from the otc marketplace and successfully uplist to a national exchange such as the nyse mkt or the nasdaq in order to help unlock the value we have achieved to date and to develop greater liquidity for our shareholders our second goal is to demonstrate to the investment community how we will leverage our brand in order to achieve significant economic scale far beyond our earlier thinking we have been hard at work focused on these goals the opportunity now exists and we must position ourselves to take full advantage of the timing       page         we believe buenos aires is in the very early stages of igniting a renewed emphasis on its moniker “the paris of south america” argentina was once one of the wealthiest countries in the world and buenos aires enjoyed a reputation as one of the globe’s most elegant hotspots before peronism buenos aires had a place among the top fashion capitals of the world alongside paris milan london tokyo and new york but argentina’s capital city lost its foothold on that list many years ago due to bad politics protectionist trade measures and limits on imports and exports last year president macri’s administration reversed many of these businessunfriendly policies and now trade is coming back tourism levels are at an alltime high and growing and significant import and export restrictions have been lifted we believe there is now substantial opportunity in argentina’s luxury goods market and that there will be a renewed global interest in argentinian luxury goods specifically those from buenos aires   as discussed below if we are to achieve scale our thinking is to shift well beyond our branded wines and hospitality sectors and to do that we have launched two new initiatives the creation of “algodon – buenos aires” branded products and providing access to other luxury argentinian products via a new global ecommerce platform we believe the potential for economic scale which these initiatives present can be significant   we have identified and begun working on a number of programs and initiatives which we believe will lead to better financial results derived from increased revenues while also leveraging our brand to achieve a new level of scale   here is where it gets exciting      us wine sales algodon fine wines will soon be available for sale online at sherrylehmanncom which ships to  states and at sherrylehmann’s iconic retail store in new york city to help get the word out in the ny metro area time warner cable “spectrum” television’s local program “a taste of new york” featured a  minute segment featuring algodon fine wines which was aired weekly for four weeks a total of  minutes of air time a taste of new york has a potential local audience of  million weekly sherrylehmann also recently announced that they will soon enter the california market with a retail store slated to open in early  in the greater los angeles area where we hope to also be represented our importer’s goal is to have our wines in the major winedrinking markets in the us including ca tx il and others the potential for scale here is significant          algodon group will leverage sotheby’s international realty brand and network with more than  sales associates located in  offices in  countries and territories worldwide while utilizing the local expertise of sotheby’s international realty recent local partnership to form ginevra sotheby’s international realty a leading luxury real estate firm in buenos aires and the rest of the country through ginevra sotheby’s international realty’s website ginevrasircom algodon wine estates listings will be marketed on sothebysrealtycom to a global clientele       page            algodon group’s internal sales team is creating a hardline marketing campaign focusing on google ads to generate additional real estate interest and leads          we anticipate that we will soon be authorized to issue deeds for lots already sold several of which have homes built on them already at algodon wine estates this will finally enable us to recognize the income from these sales on our financial statements as well as from future sales on these deeded lots          we own algodon wine estates outright – no leverage so potential buyers can turn to us for any needed financing rather than from a bank or a mortgage company by offering “owner financing” options we have created a new “interest income” revenue stream which can become substantial over time and also makes purchasing at algodon wine estates easier and a more attractive opportunity for potential buyers          as the number of sold lots at algodon wine estates increases the amount of monthly maintenance fees that we receive continues to grow and these revenues help offset the expenses we incur in continuing to build out the infrastructure of this large property          if the company is successful in an uplisting to nasdaq or the nyse mkt we believe we will be positioned to utilize the company’s stock as “currency” in a sort of “rollup strategy” to acquire other companies that fall squarely within or complement the company’s existing and planned lines of business for example we might seek to acquire businesses that offer luxury products and experiential hospitality experiences the quality of which is consistent with the algodon brand   here is where it gets more exciting      leveraging the algodon brand and building on the renewed global interest in all kinds of products from argentina we are now developing a new luxury product category to include perfumes and colognes to be marketed as luxury items from buenos aires our first product will be a perfume called oro blanco “ white gold ” by algodon  buenos aires and more products are in development we see the potential for scale here as buenos aires reasserts its position as the “paris of south america” and as one of the fashion capital cities of the world as it was in argentina’s glory days   here is a potential gamechanger      we have begun developing a usbased ecommerce portal and flash sale website dubbed “project arlux” which will offer the very best of argentina high end products and brands that reflect the quality and craftsmanship of a bygone era but which still flourishes in argentina from leather goods such as shoes boots jackets and wallets to cutlery to highend fashion jewelry and other accessories and precious metal goods to fragrances to wine  spirits the opportunity we see is broad and deep we believe the potential for scale here is particularly significant as argentina is poised to make a noteworthy reentry to international trade currently one of the few ways to buy argentina goods is to travel there and buy local we want to change that and in a favorable economic and political climate we seek to be in the forefront of opening argentina’s luxury market to the millions of potential customers around the globe interested in luxury items and experiences from argentina and of course algodon’s branded products – the wine resort the boutique hotel the premium wines and more will be well represented on this ecommerce platform       page         as we focus our business efforts on these undertakings we also seek to uplist our stock to a national exchange and to do that we seek to boost our shareholder equity which is one of the important criteria for uplisting in combination we hope we will be positioned to achieve our primary current goals trade on a national exchange and dramatically scale our product offerings as we grow our customer base and increase our revenues   we would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support which has enabled algodon to become an emerging brand known for luxury and prestige from our premium wines luxury accommodations and real estate development projects we believe algodon has earned its place as a reputable and emerging member of the global luxury community we are more enthusiastic than ever and though still a small company our reputation is growing and we believe there are significant opportunities ahead   thank you   scott l mathis founder and ceo       page         important disclosures   cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements   the information discussed in this
