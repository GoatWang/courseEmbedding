taxable typically at your ordinary marginal tax rate  federal for high earners an additional  “net investment income tax” applies certain etfs that hold stocks may distribute “qualified” dividends

shares on your behalf whenever you withdraw funds change your allocation or we rebalance harvest losses or assess our fee when you sell shares that have appreciated you realize capital gains tax if the investment has depreciated in value you realize a capital loss which is used to offset other gains that you realized that year and any excess loss may be deductible from your earned income up to a threshold set by the irs  losses not used that year may be carried forward to future years  the amount of capital gains tax you owe depends on your net gains including losses carried over from prior years and how long you held your investments before selling  shortterm capital gains tax applies if you sell shares you held for one year or less the federal shortterm capital gains tax rate is the same rate as your income tax rate  longterm capital gains tax applies if you sold shares you held longer than a year and ranges from  for high earners an additional  “net investment income tax” is added for both for each etf across your portfolio cambria’s taxmin algorithm automatically sells losses first starting with shares which have the highest cost and if realizing gains is unavoidable it

earnings and on all contribution amounts that were previously deducted  penalties may also be due if you don’t meet the withdrawal qualifications eg you withdraw before age   read more from the irs on iras and sep iras roth ira roth ira contributions are made with dollars you’ve already been taxed on — you don’t get a deduction  however at retirement as long as you’ve held the account for at least

security that has experienced a loss—and then buying a similar asset to replace it the switch does two things it allows the investor to realize or “harvest” a valuable loss while keeping the portfolio balanced at the desired allocation capital losses can lower your tax bill by offsetting other gains or ordinary income up to certain levels  but the only way to realize a loss is to sell the asset that has experienced a loss however in a wellallocated portfolio each asset plays an essential role in providing a piece of total market exposure for that reason an investor should not want to give up the expected returns associated with each asset just to realize a loss how will tax loss harvesting affect my tax returns morningtide t how will tax loss harvesting affect my tax returnsyou will

deducting the annual expenses from the dividends they pay out through the year and they tell you in advance how much that will be there are no costs to buy or sell etfs and no hidden expenses if you trade through a broker the broker will charge you a commission to execute the transaction for you cambria investments covers these transactions for you openend mutual funds have purchase and redemption fees these fees range from  percent to  percent and are charged by the fund to buy shares or to sell shares within a specified usually short period of time purchase and redemption fees differ from a commission because the money goes back into the fund rather than to a broker these fees are meant to discourage shortterm markettiming mutual funds also have internal trading fees which are not disclosed on top of the stated fee they are estimated to range from  of assets to  with an average of  the wall street journal has a good primer on this issue many passive index mutual funds’

investments hometrinity portfolio trinity portfolio morningtide t all about our trinity portfolios “how many trinity portfolios are there and how do i know which one is right for me” fortunately the answers are simple in order to meet the varying investing preferences of our clients we offer six unique trinity portfolios you might think of them as sitting along a continuum ranging from most conservative trinity  to most aggressive trinity  all six portfolios are similar in that they share the same foundational building blocks of our trinity strategy  assets diversified across a global investment set  tilts toward investments exhibiting value and momentum traits and  exposure to trend following the differences between the portfolios stem from how much of each building block you’ll find in each specific portfolio in other words what’s the specific asset mix in any given portfolio how much exposure to trend following is in any given portfolio the differences in our six trinity portfolios on the conservative end of our continuum trinity  you’ll find the asset mix dominated by bonds an asset that historically can be lessvolatile as to the second question above trinity  contains the least exposure to trend following and instead is more of a buyandhold portfolio investors who prefer trinity  are likely more conservative in nature focused less on maximizing returns and more on minimizing portfolio volatility on the aggressive end of our continuum trinity  you’ll find the asset mix dominated by stocks an asset that historically can be more volatile yet able to generate greater gains trinity  also contains the greatest exposure to trend following investors who prefer trinity  are likely more aggressive in nature preferring to target greater returns even though they may be accompanied by increased portfolio volatility trinity portfolios  –  fill in the continuum from conservative to aggressive the version we highlight in our trinity portfolio research

trinity portfolio matches your investing goals and style that said below are more details explaining the differences between our six trinity portfolios specifically the approximate allocations we expect over time please take into account that these are averages and since our portfolios are dynamic the exact amount will shift we’ll start with a chart that compares all six trinity portfolio for easy sidebyside comparison here’s another way of viewing the same information that’s a bit more visual the allocations of our six trinity portfolios below is a graphical breakdown of each trinity portfolio’s asset allocation the stated percentage of “stocks” “bonds” and “real assets” represents the amount of each asset class you’ll find in the portfolios on a fixed “buyandhold” basis please note that the “trend following” category is also comprised of “stocks” “bonds” and “real assets” however because trend is an active dynamic strategy each trinity portfolio may allocate more or less to the respective asset classes given market conditions it’s a fluid responsive allocation therefore for our purposes here we present only the total percentage of trendexposed assets you’ll find in each respective trinity portfolio trinity  stocks  bonds  real assets  trend following  trinity  stocks  bonds  real assets  trend following  trinity  stocks  bonds  real assets  trend following  trinity

investment that’s going to provide me not only income but growth too unfortunately investors have been piling into dividend funds for years now in their search for yield i’m worried that this has left me few reasonablyvalued opportunities if i invest in a potentially overvalued dividend fund today and this year bull market finally runs out of steam tomorrow then i’m risking serious losses on the other hand keeping my money on the sidelines is returning me zero is there an answer” as i’m about to show you in this paper yes i believe there is an answer – and a good one income and growth are still possible even in this market though admittedly harder to find read now meb faber’s books invest with the house hacking the top hedge funds by meb faber picking stocks is hard—and competitive the most talented investors in the world play this game and if you try to compete against them it’s like playing against the house in a casino luck can be your friend for a while but eventually the house

track their funds and stock picks and how to use that information to help guide your own portfolio in essence you will learn how to play more like the house in a casino and less like the sucker relying on dumb luck buy now global asset allocation a survey of the world’s top investment strategies by meb faber with all of our focus on assets – and how much and when to allocate them – are we missing the bigger picture our book begins by reviewing the historical performance record of popular assets like stocks bonds and cash we look at the impact inflation has on our money we then start to examine how diversification through combining assets in this case a simple stock and bond mix works to mitigate the extreme drawdowns of risky asset classes but we go beyond a limited stockbond portfolio to consider a more global allocation that also takes into account real assets we track  assets and their returns since  with particular attention to a number of wellknown portfolios like ray dalio’s all weather portfolio the endowment portfolio warren buffett’s suggestion and others and what we find is that with a few notable exceptions many of the allocations have similar exposures and yet while we are all busy paying close attention to our portfolio’s particular allocation of assets the greatest impact on our portfolios may be something we fail to notice altogether… buy now the ivy portfolio how to invest like the top endowments and avoid the bear markets by meb faber a doityourself guide to investing like the renowned harvard and yale endowments the ivy portfolio shows stepbystep how to track and mimic the investment strategies of the highly successful harvard and yale endowments using the endowment policy portfolios as a guide the authors illustrate how an investor

strategy to protect them from bear markets the book will also showcase a method to follow the smart money and piggyback the top hedge funds and their stockpicking abilities with readable straightforward advice the ivy portfolio will show investors exactly how this can be accomplished—and allow them to achieve an unparalleled level of investment success in the process with all of the uncertainty in the markets today the ivy portfolio helps the reader answer the most often asked question in investing today – “what do i do” buy now global value how to spot bubbles avoid market crashes and earn big returns in the stock market by meb faber investment bubbles and speculative manias have existed for as long as humans have been involved in markets is it possible for investors to identify emerging bubbles and then profit from their inflation likewise can investors avoid the bursting of these bubbles and the extreme volatility and losses found in their aftermath to survive to invest another day over  years ago benjamin graham and david dodd proposed valuing stocks with earnings smoothed across multiple years robert shiller later popularized this method with his version of the cyclically adjusted pricetoearnings cape ratio in the late s and correctly issued a timely warning of poor stock returns to follow in the coming years we apply this valuation metric across more than  foreign markets and find it both practical and useful indeed we witness even greater examples of bubbles and busts abroad than in the united states we then create a trading system to build global stock portfolios and find significant outperformance by selecting markets based on relative and absolute valuation buy now shareholder yield a better approach to dividend investing by meb faber shareholder yield a better approach to dividend investing shows stepbystep how to find returns in a low yield world investors have flocked to dividend stocks in search of yield however fewer companies are paying out less in dividends due to legal tax and structural changes in the us markets dividend payments are only one use of a company’s free cash flow other uses of cash include share repurchases debt paydown reinvestment in the business and mergers and acquisitions consequently investors in the st century must look to all of the direct and indirect ways in which companies distribute their cash to shareholders a metric commonly referred to as “shareholder yield” in this book we analyze portfolios based on the various cash flow metrics and find that portfolios of companies with high shareholder yields outperform both broad market indices and high dividend yield portfolios by a substantial margin with all of the uncertainty in the markets today shareholder yield helps the reader answer one of the most often asked question in investing today – “where do i find yield” buy now meb faber’s white papers a quantitative approach to tactical asset allocation in this paper we update our  white paper “a quantitative approach to tactical asset allocation” with new data from the  period how well did the purpose of the original paper – to present a simple quantitative method that improves the riskadjusted returns across various asset classes – hold up since publication overall we find that the models have performed well in realtime achieving equity like returns with bond like volatility and drawdowns we also examine the effects of departures from the original system including adding more asset classes introducing various portfolio allocations and implementing alternative cash management strategies download relative strength strategies for investing the purpose of this paper is to present simple quantitative methods that improve riskadjusted returns for investing in us equity sectors and global asset class portfolios a relative strength model is tested on the frenchfama us equity sector data back to the s that results in increased absolute returns with equitylike risk the relative strength portfolios outperform the buy and hold benchmark in approximately  of all years and returns are persistent across time the addition of a trendfollowing parameter to dynamically hedge the portfolio decreases both volatility and drawdown the relative strength model is then tested across a portfolio of global asset classes with supporting results download global value building trading models with the  year cape over seventy years ago benjamin graham and david dodd proposed valuing securities with earnings smoothed across multiple years robert shiller popularized this method with his version of this cyclically adjusted pricetoearnings ratio cape in the late s and issued a timely warning of poor stock returns to follow in the coming years we apply this valuation metric across over thirty foreign markets and find it both practical and useful and indeed witness even greater examples of bubbles and busts abroad than in the united states we then create a trading system to build global stock portfolios based on valuation and find significant outperformance by selecting markets based on relative and absolute valuation download where the black swans hide  the  best days myth below we examine market outliers in financial markets how much effect do these outliers have on long term performance can the investor prepare for these anomalies or are they truly ‘black swans’ that cannot be managed in this issue we examine numerous global financial markets on daily and monthly time frames we find that these rare outliers have a massive impact on returns however these outliers tend to cluster and the majority of both good and bad outliers occur once markets have already been declining we critique the “missing the bestdays” argument proffered by advocates of buy and hold investing demonstrating that a significant majority of the  best days and the  worst days occur in declining markets we continue to advocate that investors attempt to avoid declining markets where most of the volatility lies and conclude that market timing and risk management is indeed possible and beneficial to the investor download learning to love investment bubbles what if sir isaac newton had been a trendfollower investment manias and financial bubbles have likely existed for as long as humans have been involved in financial markets in this research piece we take a look at some of the more famous market bubbles in history and the extreme volatility and drawdowns they experienced we then examine a simple trendfollowing approach investors could use to manage their risk across twelve market bubbles we find that a trendfollowing system would have improved return while reducing volatility most importantly it would have reduced drawdowns significantly leading to the most important rule in all of investing – surviving to invest another day download finding yield in a  world many investors are surprised to learn that the largest asset class in the world is foreign debt us investors often allocate very little to foreign bonds and when they do it is through capitalization weighted indexes these indexes allocate the highest weighting to countries with the most debt outstanding is there a better way to invest in global bonds we examine a simple value approach applied to global sovereign bonds and find that it works well across decades in a world of very low and even negative yields a value approach could potentially add a well needed source of income to a diversified portfolio download learning to play offense and defense combining value and momentum from the bottom up and the top down sorting stocks based on value and momentum factors historically has led to outperformance over the broad us stock market however any longonly strategy is subject to similar volatility and drawdowns as the sp  drawdowns of  or even  make implementation of a stock strategy very challenging is there a way to add value on stock selection but also reduce volatility and drawdowns of a long only strategy with hedging techniques in this paper we examine the possibility of following a strategy that combines aggressive offense and smart defense to target outsized returns with manageable risk and drawdowns download what if  is really  pension funds investing with fingerscrossed and eyes closed it is well known that pension funds in the united states are underfunded even if they achieve their projected  rate of return the scope of pension underfunding increases to an astonishing level when more probable future rates are employed a reduction in the future rate of return from  to the more reasonable riskfree rate of approximately  causes the liabilities to explode by trillions of dollars as bond yields declined over the past twenty years pension funds moved toward more aggressive equitybased portfolios in an attempt to reach for this  return by investing in a portfolio with uncertain outcomes pension funds could experience increasingly volatile and even negative returns paradoxically in an effort to chase the universal  rate pension funds may be laying the groundwork for returns even lower than the risk free rate in an effort to offer an empirical basis for this possibility we conclude the paper with a relevant comparison – the return of a hypothetical japanese pension for the past two decades we believe that pension funds need to at least prepare for the unfathomable  returns for  years most pension funds regrettably have not adequately stress tested their portfolios for these scenarios download global cape model optimization we use the shiller cape model proposed by mebane faber as a template for the exploration of a variety of portfolio optimization methods by virtue of the model’s systematic allocation to the ‘cheapest’ markets with the highest theoretical risk premia the model has the potential to extract high costs from ‘behavioural taxes’ related to the model’s extreme volatility and drawdown character we apply several portfolio optimization techniques with the objective of maximizing portfolio sharpe ratios and minimizing drawdowns including dynamic volatility weighting risk parity target risk and minimum variance consistent with recent published research on robust portfolio optimization return to risk ratios improve broadly with the greatest impact achieved from procedures that manage positions andor portfolios to an ex ante target volatility a theoretical framework is also proposed download politics and profit combining the presidential cycle and the january effect does the intersection of two market anomalies set the stage for outsized performance the first is what is known as the presidential cycle this theory goes that equity returns during the third and fourth years of a president’s term are more favorable than the first two years a second market bias is the large outperformance of small cap stocks in january historically small caps outperformed large caps in  of all januaries by  percentage points per year historically across the  months in the four year cycle the january of year  is the single biggest outperformer with median returns since  of nearly  a month for small caps does this mean that january is guaranteed to be great again nothing is guaranteed – year  januaries have varied from  to down  while many of these tendencies are just that investors can view them as head or tailwinds that could give bulls and bears pause download videos featuring meb faber late stage bull market it’s getting old pro meb
