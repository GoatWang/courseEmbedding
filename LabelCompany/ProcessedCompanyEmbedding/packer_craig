research serengeti lion projectedit in  packer began the serengeti lion project to study various historical questions about lions one of his biggest contributions to the serengeti lion project was the discovery that successive outbreaks of canine distemper virus had different impacts depending on the rainfall patterns from the previous year packer studied how severe droughts led to coinfections of canine distemper virus by a tickborne parasite babesia the coinfection mixed with high levels of babesia showed to be far more fatal than the distemper virus itself packer also studied the effects of a full moon and its correlation to the number of lion attacks along with his colleagues they discovered that the risks of maneating attacks are highest during the first week after the full moon which may help explain why there are so many myths about the full moon they also discovered that people in southern tanzania are most at risk from maneating lions in areas where they have to sleep in their
