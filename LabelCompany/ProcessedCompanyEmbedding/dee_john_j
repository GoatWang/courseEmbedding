advisors gemma frisius gerardus mercator notable students thomas digges known for advisor to queen elizabeth i john dee  july  –  or  was an english mathematician astronomer astrologer occult philosopher and advisor to queen elizabeth i he devoted much of his life to the study of alchemy divination and hermetic philosophy he was also an advocate of englands imperial expansion into a british empire a term he is generally credited with coining dee straddled the worlds of science and magic just as they were becoming distinguishable one of the most learned men of his age he had been invited to lecture on the geometry of euclid at the university of paris while still in his early twenties dee was an ardent promoter of mathematics and a respected astronomer as well as a leading expert in navigation having trained many of those who would conduct englands voyages of discovery simultaneously with these efforts dee immersed himself in the worlds of magic astrology and hermetic philosophy he devoted much time and effort in the last thirty years or so of his life to attempting to commune with angels in order to learn the universal language of creation and bring about the preapocalyptic unity of mankind a student of the renaissance neoplatonism of marsilio ficino dee did not draw distinctions between his mathematical research and his investigations into hermetic magic angel summoning and divination instead he considered all of his activities to constitute different facets of the same quest the search for a transcendent understanding of the divine forms which underlie the visible world which dee called pure verities in his lifetime dee amassed one of the largest libraries in england his high status as a scholar also allowed him to play a role in elizabethan politics he served as an occasional advisor and tutor to elizabeth i and nurtured relationships with her ministers francis walsingham and william cecil dee also tutored and enjoyed patronage relationships with sir philip sidney his uncle robert dudley st earl of leicester and edward dyer he also enjoyed patronage from sir christopher hatton contents  biography  early life  later

to rowland dee of welsh descent and johanna wild his surname dee derived from the welsh du black his grandfather was bedo ddu of nantygroes pilleth radnorshire and john retained his connection with the locality his father roland was a mercer and gentleman courtier to henry viii john dee claimed to be a descendant of rhodri the great prince of wales and constructed a pedigree showing his descent from rhodri dees family arrived in london in the wake of henry tudors coronation as henry vii jane dee was the daughter of william wild dee attended the chelmsford chantry school now king edward vi grammar school from  to  he entered st johns college cambridge in november  aged  graduating ba in  or early  his abilities recognised he became an original fellow of trinity college cambridge on its founding by henry viii in  at trinity the clever stage effects he produced for a production of aristophanes peace procured him the reputation of being a magician that clung to him through life in the late s and early s he travelled in europe studying at louvain  and brussels and lecturing in paris on euclid he studied with gemma frisius and became a close friend of the cartographer gerardus mercator and cartographer abraham ortelius returning to england with an important collection of mathematical and astronomical instruments in  he met gerolamo cardano in london during their acquaintance they investigated a perpetual motion machine as well as a gem purported to have magical properties rector at uptonuponsevern from  dee was offered a readership in mathematics at oxford in  which he declined he was occupied with writing and perhaps hoped for a better position at court in  dee became a member of the worshipful company of mercers as his father had through the companys system of patrimony that same year  he was arrested and charged with calculating for having cast horoscopes of queen mary and princess elizabeth the charges were expanded to treason against mary dee appeared in the star chamber and exonerated himself but was turned over to the catholic bishop bonner for religious examination his strong and lifelong penchant for secrecy perhaps worsening matters this entire episode was only the most dramatic in a series of attacks and slanders that would dog dee throughout his life clearing his name yet again he soon became a close associate of bonner dee presented queen mary with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library in  but his proposal was not taken up instead he expanded his personal library at his house in mortlake tirelessly acquiring books and manuscripts in england and on the european continent dees library a centre of learning outside the universities became the greatest in england and attracted many scholars dees glyph whose meaning he explained in monas hieroglyphica when elizabeth took the throne in  dee became her trusted advisor on astrological and scientific matters choosing elizabeths coronation date himself from the s through the s he served as an advisor to englands voyages of discovery providing technical assistance in navigation and ideological backing in the creation of a british empire a term that he was the first to use dee wrote a letter to william cecil st baron burghley in october  seeking patronage he claimed to have occult knowledge of treasure in the welsh marches and of valuable ancient manuscripts kept at wigmore castle knowing that the lord treasurers ancestors came from this area in  dee published general and rare memorials pertayning to the perfect arte of navigation a work that set out his vision of a maritime empire and asserted english territorial claims on the new world dee was acquainted with humphrey gilbert and was close to sir philip sidney and his circle in  dee wrote the hermetic work monas hieroglyphica the hieroglyphic monad an exhaustive cabalistic interpretation of a glyph of his own design meant to express the mystical unity of all creation having dedicated it to maximilian ii holy roman emperor in an effort to gain patronage dee attempted to present it to him during the time of his ascension to the throne of hungary this work was esteemed by many of dees contemporaries but the work can not be interpreted today without the secret oral tradition from that era he published a mathematical preface to henry billingsleys english translation of euclids elements in  arguing the central importance of mathematics and outlining mathematics influence on the other arts and sciences intended for an audience outside the universities it proved to be dees most widely influential and frequently reprinted work later lifeedit the seal of god british museum by the early s dee was growing dissatisfied with his progress in learning the secrets of nature as well as his failing influence and recognition in court circles failure of his proposed calendar revision imperial recommendations and ambivalent results from exploration of north america had nearly brought his hopes of political patronage to an end as a result he began a more energetic turn towards the supernatural as a means to acquire knowledge specifically he sought to contact spirits through the use of a scryer or crystalgazer which would act as an intermediary between dee and the angels dees first attempts with several scryers were not satisfactory but in  he met edward kelley then going under the name of edward talbot to disguise his conviction for coining or forgery who impressed him greatly with his abilities dee took kelley into his service and began to devote all his energies to his supernatural pursuits these spiritual conferences or actions were conducted with an air of intense christian piety always after periods of purification prayer and fasting dee was convinced of the benefits they could bring to mankind the character of kelley is harder to assess some have concluded that he acted with complete cynicism but delusion or selfdeception are not out of the question kelleys output is remarkable for its sheer volume its intricacy and its vividness dee maintained that the angels laboriously dictated several books to him this way through kelley some in a special angelic or enochian language edward kelley in  dee met the visiting impoverished yet popular polish nobleman albert łaski who after overstaying his welcome at court invited dee to accompany him on his return to poland with some prompting by the angels again through kelley and his worsening status at court dee was persuaded to go dee kelley and their families left for the continent in september  but łaski proved to be bankrupt and out of favour in his own country dee and kelley began a nomadic life in central europe meanwhile continuing their spiritual conferences which dee recorded meticulously in his diaries and almanacs they had audiences with emperor rudolf ii in prague castle and king stefan batory of poland whom they attempted to convince of the importance of angelic communication the meeting with the polish king stefan batory took place at the royal castle at niepołomice near kraków then the capital of poland and was later widely analyzed by polish historians ryszard zieliński roman żelewski roman bugaj and writers waldemar łysiakcitation needed while generally dee was accepted as a man of wide and deep knowledge they mistrusted his connection with the english monarch elizabeth i they could not be sure that their meetings were without political ramifications some thought and still do that dee was in fact a spy for the british monarch nevertheless the polish king a devout catholic and very cautious of supernatural media began their meetings with the affirmation that any prophetic revelations must be in keeping with the teachings of jesus christ the mission of the holy catholic church and the approval of the pope in  during a spiritual conference in bohemia kelley informed dee that the angel uriel had ordered the men to share all their possessions including their wives by this time kelley had gained some renown as an alchemist and in fact was more soughtafter than dee in this regard this was a line of work that had prospects for serious and longterm financial gain especially among the royal families of central europe dee on the other hand was more interested in communicating with the angels who he believed would help him solve the mysteries of the heavens through mathematics optics astrology science and navigation it may be that kelley in fact wished to end dees dependence on him as a scryer for their increasingly lengthy and frequent spiritual conferences the order for wifesharing caused dee great anguish but he apparently did not doubt its genuineness they apparently did share wives however dee broke off the conferences immediately afterwards dee returned to england in  kelley went on to be the alchemist for emperor rudolf ii nine months later on feb   a son was born to dees wife whom dee baptized theodorus trebonianus dee and raised as his own it is possible that this child was kelleys dee was  at the time edward kelley was  final yearsedit dees obsidian aztec scrying mirror john dee memorial plaque installed in  inside the church of st mary the virgin mortlake dee returned to mortlake after six years abroad to find his home vandalized his library ruined and many of his prized books and instruments stolen furthermore dee found that increasing criticism of occult practices had made england even more inhospitable to his magical practices and natural philosophy dee sought support from elizabeth who hoped he could persuade kelley to return and ease englands economic burdens through alchemy she finally appointed dee warden of christs college manchester in  this former college of priests had been reestablished as a protestant institution by a royal charter of  however he could not exert much control over the fellows of that college who despised or cheated him early in his tenure he was consulted on the demonic possession of seven children but took little interest in the matter although he did allow those involved to consult his still extensive library he left manchester in  to return to london however he remained warden until his death by that time elizabeth was dead and james i provided no support dee spent his final years in poverty at mortlake forced to sell off various of his possessions to support himself and his daughter katherine who cared for him until the end he died in mortlake late in  or early  aged  there are no extant records of the exact date as both the parish registers and dees gravestone are missing in  a memorial plaque to dee was placed on the south wall of the present church personal lifeedit dee was married three times and had eight children he first married katherine constable in  she died in  and their union resulted in no children his second also childless marriage to an unknown woman lasted only a year until her death in  from  to  dee kept a sporadic diary also referred to as his almanac from which most of what we know about his life during that time has been gleaned in  he married the yearold jane fromond dee was fiftyone at the time jane had her own connections to the elizabethan court she was a lady in waiting to elizabeth clinton countess of lincoln a position she gave up when she married dee when in  kelley informed dee of the angels wish that they share wives jane dee née fromond was the wife dee shared with him although dee complied with the angels supposed request for a while he was apparently distressed by the arrangement and it was one reason why the two men parted company not long thereafter some believe that dees son theodore born nine months later could have been kelleys son not dees jane died in manchester of the bubonic plague and was buried in the manchester cathedral burial grounds in march  michael born in prague died on his fathers birthday in  theodore born in trebona died in manchester in  his sons arthur dee and rowland survived him as did his daughter katherine who was his companion to the end no records exist for his youngest daughters madinia frances and margaret after  so it is widely assumed they died in the same epidemic that took their mother dee had by this time ceased keeping his diary while arthur was a student at the westminster school dee wrote a letter to his headmaster that echoes the worries of boarding school parents in every century arthur was an apprentice in much of his fathers alchemical and scientific work and was in fact often his scryer until kelley came along arthur went on to become an alchemist and hermetic author whose works were published by elias ashmole as regards dees physical appearance the antiquary john aubrey gives the following description he was tall and slender he wore a gown like an artists gown with hanging sleeves and a slit a very fair clear sanguine complexion a long beard as white as milk a very handsome man achievementsedit a chart from johannes trithemiuss steganographia in the hand of john dee who copied the entire manuscript in  thoughtedit dee was influenced by the hermetic and platonicpythagorean doctrines that were pervasive in the renaissance he believed that numbers were the basis of all things and the key to knowledge from hermeticism he drew the belief that man had the potential for divine power and he believed this divine power could be exercised through mathematics his ultimate goal was to help bring forth a unified world religion through the healing of the breach of the catholic and protestant churches and the recapture of the pure theology of the ancients advocacy of english expansionedit from  dee advocated a policy of political and economic strengthening of england and imperial expansion into the new world in his manuscript brytannicae reipublicae synopsis  he outlined the current state of the elizabethan realm and was concerned with trade ethics and national strength his  general and rare memorials pertayning to the perfect arte of navigation was the first volume in an unfinished series planned to advocate the rise of imperial expansion in the highly symbolic frontispiece dee included a figure of britannia kneeling by the shore beseeching elizabeth i to protect her empire by strengthening her navy dee used geoffreys inclusion of ireland in arthurs imperial conquests to argue that arthur had established a british empire abroad he further argued that england exploit new lands through colonisation and that this vision could become reality through maritime supremacy dee has been credited with the coining of the term british empire however humphrey llwyd has also been credited with the first use of the term in his commentarioli britannicae descriptionis fragmentum published eight years earlier in  dee posited a formal claim to north america on the back of a map drawn in – he noted circa  mr robert thorn his father and mr eliot of bristow discovered newfound land in his title royal of  he invented the claim that madog ab owain gwynedd had discovered america with the intention of ensuring that englands claim to the new world was stronger than that of spain he further asserted that brutus of britain and king arthur as well as madog had conquered lands in the americas and therefore their heir elizabeth i of england had a priority claim there reputation and significanceedit about ten years after dees death the antiquarian robert cotton purchased land around dees house and began digging in search of papers and artifacts he discovered several manuscripts mainly records of dees angelic communications cottons son gave these manuscripts to the scholar méric casaubon who published them in  together with a long introduction critical of their author as a true  faithful relation of what passed for many yeers between dr john dee a mathematician of great fame in q eliz and king james their reignes and some spirits as the first public revelation of dees spiritual conferences the book was extremely popular and sold quickly casaubon who believed in the reality of spirits argued in his introduction that dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels this book is largely responsible for the image prevalent for the following two and a half centuries of dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic around the same time the true and faithful relation was published members of the rosicrucian movement claimed dee as one of their number there is doubt however that an organized rosicrucian movement existed during dees lifetime and no evidence that he ever belonged to any secret fraternity dees reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with edward kelley have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to fabulists writers of horror stories and latterday magicians the accretion of false and often fanciful information about dee often obscures the facts of his life remarkable as they are in themselves it also does nothing to promote his christian leanings dee looked to the angels to speak to him about how he might heal the very deep and serious rifts between the roman catholic church the reformed church of england and the protestant movement in england queen elizabeth i used him as her court astronomer on a number of occasions not solely because he practised hermetic arts but because he was a deeply religious and learned man whom she trusted a reevaluation of dees character and significance came in the th century largely as a result of the work of the historians charlotte fellsmith and dame frances yates both writers brought into focus the parallel roles magic science and religion held in the elizabethan renaissance fellsmith writes there is perhaps no learned author in history who has been so persistently misjudged nay even slandered by his posterity and not a voice in all the three centuries uplifted even to claim for him a fair hearing surely it is time that the cause of all this universal condemnation should be examined in the light of reason and science and perhaps it will be found to exist mainly in the fact that he was too far advanced in speculative thought for his own age to understand  as a result of this and subsequent reevaluation dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and bookcollector a devoted christian albeit during a very confusing time for that faith an able scientist and one of the most learned men of his day his personal library at mortlake was the largest in the country before it was vandalized and was created at enormous and sometimes ruinous personal expense it was considered one of the finest in europe perhaps second only to that of de thou as well as being an astrological and scientific advisor to elizabeth and her court he was an early advocate of the colonisation of north america and a visionary of a british empire stretching across the north atlantic dee promoted the sciences of navigation and cartography he studied closely with gerardus mercator and he owned an important collection of maps globes and astronomical instruments he developed new instruments as well as special navigational techniques for use in polar regions dee served as an advisor to the english voyages of discovery and personally selected pilots and trained them in navigation he believed that mathematics which he understood mystically was central to the progress of human learning the centrality of mathematics to dees vision makes him to that extent more modern than francis bacon though some scholars believe bacon purposely downplayed mathematics in the antioccult atmosphere of the reign of james i it should be noted though that dees understanding of the role of mathematics is radically different from our contemporary view dees promotion of mathematics outside the universities was an enduring practical achievement as with most of his writings dee chose to write in english rather than latin to make his writings accessible to the general public his mathematical preface to euclid was meant to promote the study and application of mathematics by those without a university education and was very popular and influential among the mecanicians the new and growing class of technical craftsmen and artisans dees preface included demonstrations of mathematical principles that readers could perform themselves without special education or training during the th century the municipal borough of richmond now the london borough of richmond upon thames honoured john dee by naming a street near mortlake where he lived dee road after him calendaredit dee was a friend of tycho brahe and was familiar with the work translated into english by his ward and assistant thomas digges of nicolaus copernicus many of his astronomical calculations were based on copernican assumptions but he never openly espoused the heliocentric theory dee applied copernican theory to the problem of calendar reform in  he was asked to advise the queen about the new gregorian calendar that had been promulgated by pope gregory xiii from october  his advice was that england should accept it albeit with seven specific amendments the first of these was that the adjustment should not be the  days that would restore the calendar to the time of the council of nicaea in  ad but by  days which would restore it to the birth of christ another proposal of dees was to align the civil and liturgical years and to have them both start on  january perhaps predictably england chose to spurn any suggestions that had papist origins despite any merit they may objectively have and dees advice was rejected voynich manuscriptedit he has often been associated with the voynich manuscript wilfrid michael voynich who bought the manuscript in  suggested that dee may have owned the manuscript and sold it to rudolph ii dees contacts with rudolph were far less extensive than had previously been thought however and dees diaries show no evidence of the sale dee was however known to have possessed a copy of the book of soyga another enciphered book worksedit monas hieroglyphica  preface to billingsleys euclid billingsleys translation of euclids elements  on the mystical rule of the seven planets

mirror an obsidian aztec cult object in the shape of a handmirror brought to europe in the late s which was subsequently owned by horace walpole jennifer rampling has claimed that dee never actually owned this objectcitation needed the item now residing in the british museum was first attributed to dee by horace walpole lord frederick campbell had brought a round piece of shining black marble in a leathern case to walpole in an attempt to ascertain the objects provenance according to walpole he responded saying oh lord i am the only man in england that can tell you it is dr dees black stone there is no explicit reference to the mirror in any of dees surviving writings the provenance of the museums obsidian speculum as well as the crystal ball is in fact dubiouscitation needed the small wax seals used to support the legs of dees table of practice the table at which the scrying was performed the large elaborately decorated wax seal of god used to support the shewstone the crystal ball used for scrying a gold amulet engraved with a representation of one of kelleys visions a crystal globe six centimetres in diameter this item remained unnoticed for many years in the mineral collection possibly the one owned by dee but the provenance of this object is less certain than that of the others in december  both a shew stone a stone used for scrying formerly belonging to dee and a midth century explanation of its use written by nicholas culpeper were stolen from the science museum in london they were recovered shortly afterwards literary and cultural referencesedit this

queen elizabeth i he devoted much of his life to the study of alchemy divination and hermetic philosophy he was also an advocate of englands imperial expansion into a british empire a term he is generally credited with coining dee straddled the worlds of science and magic just as they were becoming distinguishable one of the most learned men of his age he had been invited to lecture on the geometry of euclid at the university of paris while still in his early twenties dee was an ardent promoter of mathematics and a respected astronomer as well as a leading expert in navigation having trained many of those who would conduct englands voyages of discovery simultaneously with these efforts dee immersed himself in the worlds of magic astrology and hermetic philosophy he devoted much time and effort in the last thirty years or so of his life to attempting to commune with angels in order to learn the universal language of creation and bring about the preapocalyptic unity of mankind a student of the renaissance neoplatonism of marsilio ficino dee did not draw distinctions between his mathematical research and his investigations into hermetic magic angel summoning and divination instead he considered all of his activities to constitute different facets of the same quest the search for a transcendent understanding of the divine forms which underlie the visible world which dee called pure verities in his lifetime dee amassed one of the largest libraries in england his high status as a scholar also allowed him to play a role in elizabethan politics he served as an occasional advisor and tutor to elizabeth i and nurtured relationships with her ministers francis walsingham and william cecil dee also tutored and enjoyed patronage relationships with sir philip sidney his

his surname dee derived from the welsh du black his grandfather was bedo ddu of nantygroes pilleth radnorshire and john retained his connection with the locality his father roland was a mercer and gentleman courtier to henry viii john dee claimed to be a descendant of rhodri the great prince of wales and constructed a pedigree showing his descent from rhodri dees family arrived in london in the wake of henry tudors coronation as henry vii jane dee was the daughter of william wild dee attended the chelmsford chantry school now king edward vi grammar school from  to  he entered st johns college cambridge in november  aged  graduating ba in  or early  his abilities recognised he became an original fellow of trinity college cambridge on its founding by henry viii in  at trinity the clever stage effects he produced for a production of aristophanes peace procured him the reputation of being a magician that clung to him through life in the late s and early s he travelled in europe studying at louvain  and brussels and lecturing in paris on euclid he studied with gemma frisius and became a close friend of the cartographer gerardus mercator and cartographer abraham ortelius returning to england with an important collection of mathematical and astronomical instruments in  he met gerolamo cardano in london during their acquaintance they investigated a perpetual motion machine as well as a gem purported to have magical properties rector at uptonuponsevern from  dee was offered a readership in mathematics at oxford in  which he declined he was occupied with writing and perhaps hoped for a better position at court in  dee became a member of the worshipful company of mercers as his father had through the companys system of patrimony that same year  he was arrested and charged with calculating for having cast horoscopes of queen mary and princess elizabeth the charges were expanded to treason against mary dee appeared in the star chamber and exonerated himself but was turned over to the catholic bishop bonner for religious examination his strong and lifelong penchant for secrecy perhaps worsening matters this entire episode was only the most dramatic in a series of attacks and slanders that would dog dee throughout his life clearing his name yet again he soon became a close associate of bonner dee presented queen mary with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library in  but his proposal was not taken up instead he expanded his personal library at his house in mortlake tirelessly acquiring books and manuscripts in england and on the european continent dees library a centre of learning outside the universities became the greatest in england and attracted many scholars dees glyph whose meaning he explained in monas hieroglyphica when elizabeth took the throne in  dee became her trusted advisor on astrological and scientific matters choosing elizabeths coronation date himself from the s through the s he served as an advisor to englands voyages of discovery providing technical assistance in navigation and ideological backing in the creation of a british empire a term that he was the first to use dee wrote a letter to william cecil st baron burghley in october  seeking patronage he claimed to have occult knowledge of treasure in the welsh marches and of valuable ancient manuscripts kept at wigmore castle knowing that the lord treasurers ancestors came from this area in  dee published general and rare memorials pertayning to the perfect arte of navigation a work that set out his vision of a maritime empire and asserted english territorial claims on the new world dee was acquainted with humphrey gilbert and was close to sir philip sidney and his circle in  dee wrote the hermetic work monas hieroglyphica the hieroglyphic monad an exhaustive cabalistic interpretation of a glyph of his own design meant to express the mystical unity of all creation having dedicated it to maximilian ii holy roman emperor in an effort to gain patronage dee attempted to present it to him during the time of his ascension to the throne of hungary this work was esteemed by many of dees contemporaries but the work can not be interpreted today without the secret oral tradition from that era he published a mathematical preface to henry billingsleys english translation of euclids elements in  arguing the central importance of mathematics and outlining mathematics influence on the other arts and sciences intended for an audience outside the universities it proved to be dees most widely influential and frequently reprinted work later lifeedit the seal of god british museum by the early s dee was growing dissatisfied with his progress in learning the secrets of nature as well as his failing influence and recognition in court circles failure of his proposed calendar revision imperial recommendations and ambivalent results from exploration of north america had nearly brought his hopes of political patronage to an end as a result he began a more energetic turn towards the supernatural as a means to acquire knowledge specifically he sought to contact spirits through the use of a scryer or crystalgazer which would act as an intermediary between dee and the angels dees first attempts with several scryers were not satisfactory but in  he met edward kelley then going under the name of edward talbot to disguise his conviction for coining or forgery who impressed him greatly with his abilities dee took kelley into his service and began to devote all his energies to his supernatural pursuits these spiritual conferences or actions were conducted with an air of intense christian piety always after periods of purification prayer and fasting dee was convinced of the benefits they could bring to mankind the character of kelley is harder to assess some have concluded that he acted with complete cynicism but delusion or selfdeception are not out of the question kelleys output is remarkable for its sheer volume its intricacy and its vividness dee maintained that the angels laboriously dictated several books to him this way through kelley some in a special angelic or enochian language edward kelley in  dee met the visiting impoverished yet popular polish nobleman albert łaski who after overstaying his welcome at court invited dee to accompany him on his return to poland with some prompting by the angels again through kelley and his worsening status at court dee was persuaded to go dee kelley and their families left for the continent in september  but łaski proved to be bankrupt and out of favour in his own country dee and kelley began a nomadic life in central europe meanwhile continuing their spiritual conferences which dee recorded meticulously in his diaries and almanacs they had audiences with emperor rudolf ii in prague castle and king stefan batory of poland whom they attempted to convince of the importance of angelic communication the meeting with the polish king stefan batory took place at the royal castle at niepołomice near kraków then the capital of poland and was later widely analyzed by polish historians ryszard zieliński roman żelewski roman bugaj and writers waldemar łysiakcitation needed while generally dee was accepted as a man of wide and deep knowledge they mistrusted his connection with the english monarch elizabeth i they could not be sure that their meetings were without political ramifications some thought and still do that dee was in fact a spy for the british monarch nevertheless the polish king a devout catholic and very cautious of supernatural media began their meetings with the affirmation that any prophetic revelations must be in keeping with the teachings of jesus christ the mission of the holy catholic church and the approval of the pope in  during a spiritual conference in bohemia kelley informed dee that the angel uriel had ordered the men to share all their possessions including their wives by this time kelley had gained some renown as an alchemist and in fact was more soughtafter than dee in this regard this was a line of work that had prospects for serious and longterm financial gain especially among the royal families of central europe dee on the other hand was more interested in communicating with the angels who he believed would help him solve the mysteries of the heavens through mathematics optics astrology science and navigation it may be that kelley in fact wished to end dees dependence on him as a scryer for their increasingly lengthy and frequent spiritual conferences the order for wifesharing caused dee great anguish but he apparently did not doubt its genuineness they apparently did share wives however dee broke off the conferences immediately afterwards dee returned to england in  kelley went on to be the alchemist for emperor rudolf ii nine months later on feb   a son was born to dees wife whom dee baptized theodorus trebonianus dee and raised as his own it is possible that this child was kelleys dee was  at the time edward kelley was  final yearsedit dees obsidian aztec scrying mirror john dee memorial plaque installed in  inside the church of st mary the virgin mortlake dee returned to mortlake after six years abroad to find his home vandalized his library ruined and many of his prized books and instruments stolen furthermore dee found that increasing criticism of occult practices had made england even more inhospitable to his magical practices and natural philosophy dee sought support from elizabeth who hoped he could persuade kelley to return and ease englands economic burdens through alchemy she finally appointed dee warden of christs college manchester in  this former college of priests had been reestablished as a protestant institution by a royal charter of  however he could not exert much control over the fellows of that college who despised or cheated him early in his tenure he was consulted on the demonic possession of seven children but took little interest in the matter although he did allow those involved to consult his still extensive library he left manchester in  to return to london however he remained warden until his death by that time elizabeth was dead and james i provided no support dee spent his final years in poverty at mortlake forced to sell off various of his possessions to support himself and his daughter katherine who cared for him until the end he died in mortlake late in  or early  aged  there are no extant records of the exact date as both the parish registers and dees gravestone are missing in  a memorial plaque to dee was placed on the south wall of the present church personal lifeedit dee was married three times and had eight children he first married katherine constable in  she died in  and their union resulted in no children his second also childless marriage to an unknown woman lasted only a year until her death in  from  to  dee kept a sporadic diary also referred to as his almanac from which most of what we know about his life during that time has been gleaned in  he married the yearold jane fromond dee was fiftyone at the time jane had her own connections to the elizabethan court she was a lady in waiting to elizabeth clinton countess of lincoln a position she gave up when she married dee when in  kelley informed dee of the angels wish that they share wives jane dee née fromond was the wife dee shared with him although dee complied with the angels supposed request for a while he was apparently distressed by the arrangement and it was one reason why the two men parted company not long thereafter some believe that dees son theodore born nine months later could have been kelleys son not dees jane died in manchester of the bubonic plague and was buried in the manchester cathedral burial grounds in march  michael born in prague died on his fathers birthday in  theodore born in trebona died in manchester in  his sons arthur dee and rowland survived him as did his daughter katherine who was his companion to the end no records exist for his youngest daughters madinia frances and margaret after  so it is widely assumed they died in the same epidemic that took their mother dee had by this time ceased keeping his diary while arthur was a student at the westminster school dee wrote a letter to his headmaster that echoes the worries of boarding school parents in every century arthur was an apprentice in much of his fathers alchemical and scientific work and was in fact often his scryer until kelley came along arthur went on to become an alchemist and hermetic author whose works were published by elias ashmole as regards dees physical appearance the antiquary john aubrey gives the following description he was tall and slender he wore a gown like an artists gown with hanging sleeves and a slit a very fair clear sanguine complexion a long beard as white as milk a very handsome man achievementsedit a chart from johannes trithemiuss steganographia in the hand of john dee who copied the entire manuscript in  thoughtedit dee was influenced by the hermetic and platonicpythagorean doctrines that were pervasive in the renaissance he believed that numbers were the basis of all things and the key to knowledge from hermeticism he drew the belief that man had the potential for divine power and he believed this divine power could be exercised through mathematics his ultimate goal was to help bring forth a unified world religion through the healing of the breach of the catholic and protestant churches and the recapture of the pure theology of the ancients advocacy of english expansionedit from  dee advocated a policy of political and economic strengthening of england and imperial expansion into the new world in his manuscript brytannicae reipublicae synopsis  he outlined the current state of the elizabethan realm and was concerned with trade ethics and national strength his  general and rare memorials pertayning to the perfect arte of navigation was the first volume in an unfinished series planned to advocate the rise of imperial expansion in the highly symbolic frontispiece dee included a figure of britannia kneeling by the shore beseeching elizabeth i to protect her empire by strengthening her navy dee used geoffreys inclusion of ireland in arthurs imperial conquests to argue that arthur had established a british empire abroad he further argued that england exploit new lands through colonisation and that this vision could become reality through maritime supremacy dee has been credited with the coining of the term british empire however humphrey llwyd has also been credited with the first use of the term in his commentarioli britannicae descriptionis fragmentum published eight years earlier in  dee posited a formal claim to north america on the back of a map drawn in – he noted circa  mr robert thorn his father and mr eliot of bristow discovered newfound land in his title royal of  he invented the claim that madog ab owain gwynedd had discovered america with the intention of ensuring that englands claim to the new world was stronger than that of spain he further asserted that brutus of britain and king arthur as well as madog had conquered lands in the americas and therefore their heir elizabeth i of england had a priority claim there reputation and significanceedit about ten years after dees death the antiquarian robert cotton purchased land around dees house and began digging in search of papers and artifacts he discovered several manuscripts mainly records of dees angelic communications cottons son gave these manuscripts to the scholar méric casaubon who published them in  together with a long introduction critical of their author as a true  faithful relation of what passed for many yeers between dr john dee a mathematician of great fame in q eliz and king james their reignes and some spirits as the first public revelation of dees spiritual conferences the book was extremely popular and sold quickly casaubon who believed in the reality of spirits argued in his introduction that dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels this book is largely responsible for the image prevalent for the following two and a half centuries of dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic around the same time the true and faithful relation was published members of the rosicrucian movement claimed dee as one of their number there is doubt however that an organized rosicrucian movement existed during dees lifetime and no evidence that he ever belonged to any secret fraternity dees reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with edward kelley have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to fabulists writers of horror stories and latterday magicians the accretion of false and often fanciful information about dee often obscures the facts of his life remarkable as they are in themselves it also does nothing to promote his christian leanings dee looked to the angels to speak to him about how he might heal the very deep and serious rifts between the roman catholic church the reformed church of england and the protestant movement in england queen elizabeth i used him as her court astronomer on a number of occasions not solely because he practised hermetic arts but because he was a deeply religious and learned man whom she trusted a reevaluation of dees character and significance came in the th century largely as a result of the work of the historians charlotte fellsmith and dame frances yates both writers brought into focus the parallel roles magic science and religion held in the elizabethan renaissance fellsmith writes there is perhaps no learned author in history who has been so persistently misjudged nay even slandered by his posterity and not a voice in all the three centuries uplifted even to claim for him a fair hearing surely it is time that the cause of all this universal condemnation should be examined in the light of reason and science and perhaps it will be found to exist mainly in the fact that he was too far advanced in speculative thought for his own age to understand  as a result of this and subsequent reevaluation dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and bookcollector a devoted christian albeit during a very confusing time for that faith an able scientist and one of the most learned men of his day his personal library at mortlake was the largest in the country before it was vandalized and was created at enormous and sometimes ruinous personal expense it was considered one of the finest in europe perhaps second only to that of de thou as well as being an astrological and scientific advisor to elizabeth and her court he was an early advocate of the colonisation of north america and a visionary of a british empire stretching across the north atlantic dee promoted the sciences of navigation and cartography he studied closely with gerardus mercator and he owned an important collection of maps globes and astronomical instruments he developed new instruments as well as special navigational techniques for use in polar regions dee served as an advisor to the english voyages of discovery and personally selected pilots and trained them in navigation he believed that mathematics which he understood mystically was central to the progress of human learning the centrality of mathematics to dees vision makes him to that extent more modern than francis bacon though some scholars believe bacon purposely downplayed mathematics in the antioccult atmosphere of the reign of james i it should be noted though that dees understanding of the role of mathematics is radically different from our contemporary view dees promotion of mathematics outside the universities was an enduring practical achievement as with most of his writings dee chose to write in english rather than latin to make his writings accessible to the general public his mathematical preface to euclid was meant to promote the study and application of mathematics by those without a university education and was very popular and influential among the mecanicians the new and growing class of technical craftsmen and artisans dees preface included demonstrations of mathematical principles that readers could perform themselves without special education or training during the th century the municipal borough of richmond now the london borough of richmond upon thames honoured john dee by naming a street near mortlake where he lived dee road after him calendaredit dee was a friend of tycho brahe and was familiar with the work translated into english by his ward and assistant thomas digges of nicolaus copernicus many of his astronomical calculations were based on copernican assumptions but he never openly espoused the heliocentric theory dee applied copernican theory to the problem of calendar reform in  he was asked to advise the queen about the new gregorian calendar that had been promulgated by pope gregory xiii from october  his advice was that england should accept it albeit with seven specific amendments the first of these was that the adjustment should not be the  days that would restore the calendar to the time of the council of nicaea in  ad but by  days which would restore it to the birth of christ another proposal of dees was to align the civil and liturgical years and to have them both start on  january perhaps predictably england chose to spurn any suggestions that had papist origins despite any merit they may objectively have and dees advice was rejected voynich manuscriptedit he has often been associated with the voynich manuscript wilfrid michael voynich who bought the manuscript in  suggested that dee may have owned the manuscript and sold it to rudolph ii dees contacts with rudolph were far less extensive than had previously been thought however and dees diaries show no evidence of the sale dee was however known to have possessed a copy of the book of soyga another enciphered book worksedit

british museum the british museum holds several items once owned by dee and associated with the spiritual conferences dees speculum or mirror an obsidian aztec cult object in the shape of a handmirror brought to europe in the late s which was subsequently owned by horace walpole jennifer rampling has claimed that dee never actually owned this objectcitation needed the item now residing in the british museum was first attributed to dee by horace walpole lord frederick campbell had brought a round piece of shining black marble in a leathern case to walpole in an attempt to ascertain the objects provenance according to walpole he responded saying oh lord i am the only man in england that can tell you it is dr dees black stone there is no explicit reference to the mirror in any of dees surviving writings the provenance of the museums obsidian speculum as well as the crystal ball is in fact dubiouscitation needed the small wax seals used to support the legs of dees table of practice the table at which the scrying was performed the large elaborately decorated wax seal of god used to support the shewstone the crystal ball used for scrying a gold amulet engraved with a representation of one of kelleys visions a crystal globe six centimetres in diameter this item remained unnoticed for many years in the mineral collection possibly the one owned by dee but the provenance of this object is less certain than that of the others in december  both a shew stone a stone used for scrying formerly belonging to dee and a midth century explanation of its use written

manchester alma mater st johns college cambridge louvain university academic advisors gemma frisius gerardus mercator notable students thomas digges known for advisor to queen elizabeth i john dee  july  –  or  was an english mathematician astronomer astrologer occult philosopher and advisor to queen elizabeth i he devoted much of his life to the study of alchemy divination and hermetic philosophy he was also an advocate of englands imperial expansion into a british empire a term he is generally credited with coining dee straddled the worlds of science and magic just as they were becoming distinguishable one of the most learned men of his age he had been invited to lecture on the geometry of euclid at the university of paris while still in his early twenties dee was an ardent promoter of mathematics and a respected astronomer as well as a leading expert in navigation having trained many of those who would conduct englands voyages of discovery simultaneously with these efforts dee immersed himself in the worlds of magic astrology and hermetic philosophy he devoted much time and effort in the last thirty years or so of his life to attempting to commune with angels in order to learn the universal language of creation and bring about the preapocalyptic unity of mankind a student of the renaissance neoplatonism of marsilio ficino dee did not draw distinctions between his mathematical research and his investigations into hermetic magic angel summoning and divination instead he considered all of his activities to constitute different facets of the same quest the search for a transcendent understanding of the divine forms which underlie the visible world which dee called pure verities in his lifetime dee amassed one of the largest libraries in england his high status as a scholar also allowed him to play a role in elizabethan politics he served as an occasional advisor and tutor to elizabeth i and nurtured relationships with her ministers francis walsingham and william cecil dee also tutored and enjoyed patronage relationships with sir philip sidney his uncle robert dudley st earl of leicester and edward dyer he also enjoyed patronage from sir

biographyedit early lifeedit dee was born in tower ward london to rowland dee of welsh descent and johanna wild his surname dee derived from the welsh du black his grandfather was bedo ddu of nantygroes pilleth radnorshire and john retained his connection with the locality his father roland was a mercer and gentleman courtier to henry viii john dee claimed to be a descendant of rhodri the great prince of wales and constructed a pedigree showing his descent from rhodri dees family arrived in london in the wake of henry tudors coronation as henry vii jane dee was the daughter of william wild dee attended the chelmsford chantry school now king edward vi grammar school from  to  he entered st johns college cambridge in november  aged  graduating ba in  or early  his abilities recognised he became an original fellow of trinity college cambridge on its founding by henry viii in  at trinity the clever stage effects he produced for a production of aristophanes peace procured him the reputation of being a magician that clung to him through life in the late s and early s he travelled in europe studying at louvain  and brussels and lecturing in paris on euclid he studied with gemma frisius and became a close friend of the cartographer gerardus mercator and cartographer abraham ortelius returning to england with an important collection of mathematical and astronomical instruments in  he met gerolamo cardano in london during their acquaintance they investigated a perpetual motion machine as well as a gem purported to have magical properties rector at uptonuponsevern from  dee was offered a readership in mathematics at oxford in  which he declined he was occupied with writing and perhaps hoped for a better position at court in  dee became a member of the worshipful company of mercers as his father had through the companys system of patrimony that same year  he was arrested and charged with calculating for having cast horoscopes of queen mary and princess elizabeth the charges were expanded to treason against mary dee appeared in the star chamber and exonerated himself but was turned over to the catholic bishop bonner for religious examination his strong and lifelong penchant for secrecy perhaps worsening matters this entire episode was only the most dramatic in a series of attacks and slanders that would dog dee throughout his life clearing his name yet again he soon became a close associate of bonner dee presented queen mary with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library in  but his proposal was not taken up instead he expanded his personal library at his house in mortlake tirelessly acquiring books and manuscripts in england and on the european continent dees library a centre of learning outside the universities became the greatest in england and attracted many scholars dees glyph whose meaning he explained in monas hieroglyphica when elizabeth took the throne in  dee became her trusted advisor on astrological and scientific matters choosing elizabeths coronation date himself from the s through the s he served as an advisor to englands voyages of discovery providing technical assistance in navigation and ideological backing in the creation of a british empire a term that he was the first to use dee wrote a letter to william cecil st baron burghley in october  seeking patronage he claimed to have occult knowledge of treasure in the welsh marches and of valuable ancient manuscripts kept at wigmore castle knowing that the lord treasurers ancestors came from this area in  dee published general and rare memorials pertayning to the perfect arte of navigation a work that set out his vision of a maritime empire and asserted english territorial claims on the new world dee was acquainted with humphrey gilbert and was close to sir philip sidney and his circle in  dee wrote the hermetic work monas hieroglyphica the hieroglyphic monad an exhaustive cabalistic interpretation of a glyph of his own design meant to express the mystical unity of all creation having dedicated it to maximilian ii holy roman emperor in an effort to gain patronage dee attempted to present it to him during the time of his ascension to the throne of hungary this work was esteemed by many of dees contemporaries but the work can not be interpreted today without the secret oral tradition from that era he published a mathematical preface to henry billingsleys english translation of euclids elements in  arguing the central importance of mathematics and outlining mathematics influence on the other arts and sciences intended for an audience outside the universities it proved to be dees most widely influential and frequently reprinted work later lifeedit the seal of god british museum by the early s dee was growing dissatisfied with his progress in learning the secrets of nature as well as his failing influence and recognition in court circles failure of his proposed calendar revision imperial recommendations and ambivalent results from exploration of north america had nearly brought his hopes of political patronage to an end as a result he began a more energetic turn towards the supernatural as a means to acquire knowledge specifically he sought to contact spirits through the use of a scryer or crystalgazer which would act as an intermediary between dee and the angels dees first attempts with several scryers were not satisfactory but in  he met edward kelley then going under the name of edward talbot to disguise his conviction for coining or forgery who impressed him greatly with his abilities dee took kelley into his service and began to devote all his energies to his supernatural pursuits these spiritual conferences or actions were conducted with an air of intense christian piety always after periods of purification prayer and fasting dee was convinced of the benefits they could bring to mankind the character of kelley is harder to assess some have concluded that he acted with complete cynicism but delusion or selfdeception are not out of the question kelleys output is remarkable for its sheer volume its intricacy and its vividness dee maintained that the angels laboriously dictated several books to him this way through kelley some in a special angelic or enochian language edward kelley in  dee met the visiting impoverished yet popular polish nobleman albert łaski who after overstaying his welcome at court invited dee to accompany him on his return to poland with some prompting by the angels again through kelley and his worsening status at court dee was persuaded to go dee kelley and their families left for the continent in september  but łaski proved to be bankrupt and out of favour in his own country dee and kelley began a nomadic life in central europe meanwhile continuing their spiritual conferences which dee recorded meticulously in his diaries and almanacs they had audiences with emperor rudolf ii in prague castle and king stefan batory of poland whom they attempted to convince of the importance of angelic communication the meeting with the polish king stefan batory took place at the royal castle at niepołomice near kraków then the capital of poland and was later widely analyzed by polish historians ryszard zieliński roman żelewski roman bugaj and writers waldemar łysiakcitation needed while generally dee was accepted as a man of wide and deep knowledge they mistrusted his connection with the english monarch elizabeth i they could not be sure that their meetings were without political ramifications some thought and still do that dee was in fact a spy for the british monarch nevertheless the polish king a devout catholic and very cautious of supernatural media began their meetings with the affirmation that any prophetic revelations must be in keeping with the teachings of jesus christ the mission of the holy catholic church and the approval of the pope in  during a spiritual conference in bohemia kelley informed dee that the angel uriel had ordered the men to share all their possessions including their wives by this time kelley had gained some renown as an alchemist and in fact was more soughtafter than dee in this regard this was a line of work that had prospects for serious and longterm financial gain especially among the royal families of central europe dee on the other hand was more interested in communicating with the angels who he believed would help him solve the mysteries of the heavens through mathematics optics astrology science and navigation it may be that kelley in fact wished to end dees dependence on him as a scryer for their increasingly lengthy and frequent spiritual conferences the order for wifesharing caused dee great anguish but he apparently did not doubt its genuineness they apparently did share wives however dee broke off the conferences immediately afterwards dee returned to england in  kelley went on to be the alchemist for emperor rudolf ii nine months later on feb   a son was born to dees wife whom dee baptized theodorus trebonianus dee and raised as his own it is possible that this child was kelleys dee was  at the time edward kelley was  final yearsedit dees obsidian aztec scrying mirror john dee memorial plaque installed in  inside the church of st mary the virgin mortlake dee returned to mortlake after six years abroad to find his home vandalized his library ruined and many of his prized books and instruments stolen furthermore dee found that increasing criticism of occult practices had made england even more inhospitable to his magical practices and natural philosophy dee sought support from elizabeth who hoped he could persuade kelley to return and ease englands economic burdens through alchemy she finally appointed dee warden of christs college manchester in  this former college of priests had been reestablished as a protestant institution by a royal charter of  however he could not exert much control over the fellows of that college who despised or cheated him early in his tenure he was consulted on the demonic possession of seven children but took little interest in the matter although he did allow those involved to consult his still extensive library he left manchester in  to return to london however he remained warden until his death by that time elizabeth was dead and james i provided no support dee spent his final years in poverty at mortlake forced to sell off various of his possessions to support himself and his daughter katherine who cared for him until the end he died in mortlake late in  or early  aged  there are no extant records of the exact date as both the parish registers and dees gravestone are missing in  a memorial plaque to dee was placed on the south wall of the present church personal lifeedit dee was married three times and had eight children he first married katherine constable in  she died in  and their union resulted in no children his second also childless marriage to an unknown woman lasted only a year until her death in  from  to  dee kept a sporadic diary also referred to as his almanac from which most of what we know about his life during that time has been gleaned in  he married the yearold jane fromond dee was fiftyone at the time jane had her own connections to the elizabethan court she was a lady in waiting to elizabeth clinton countess of lincoln a position she gave up when she married dee when in  kelley informed dee of the angels wish that they share wives jane dee née fromond was the wife dee shared with him although dee complied with the angels supposed request for a while he was apparently distressed by the arrangement and it was one reason why the two men parted company not long thereafter some believe that dees son theodore born nine months later could have been kelleys son not dees jane died in manchester of the bubonic plague and was buried in the manchester cathedral burial grounds in march  michael born in prague died on his fathers birthday in  theodore born in trebona died in manchester in  his sons arthur dee and rowland survived him as did his daughter katherine who was his companion to the end no records exist for his youngest daughters madinia frances and margaret after  so it is widely assumed they died in the same epidemic that took their mother dee had by this time ceased keeping his diary while arthur was a student at the westminster school dee wrote a letter to his headmaster that echoes the worries of boarding school parents in every century arthur was an apprentice in much of his fathers alchemical and scientific work and was in fact often his scryer until kelley came along arthur went on to become an alchemist and hermetic author whose works were published by elias ashmole as regards dees physical appearance the antiquary john aubrey gives the following description he was tall and slender he wore a gown like an artists gown with hanging sleeves and a slit a very fair clear sanguine complexion a long beard as white as milk a very handsome man achievementsedit a chart from johannes trithemiuss steganographia in the hand of john dee who copied the entire manuscript in  thoughtedit dee was influenced by the hermetic and platonicpythagorean doctrines that were pervasive in the renaissance he believed that numbers were the basis of all things and the key to knowledge from hermeticism he drew the belief that man had the potential for divine power and he believed this divine power could be exercised through mathematics his ultimate goal was to help bring forth a unified world religion through the healing of the breach of the catholic and protestant churches and the recapture of the pure theology of the ancients advocacy of english expansionedit from  dee advocated a policy of political and economic strengthening of england and imperial expansion into the new world in his manuscript brytannicae reipublicae synopsis  he outlined the current state of the elizabethan realm and was concerned with trade ethics and national strength his  general and rare memorials pertayning to the perfect arte of navigation was the first volume in an unfinished series planned to advocate the rise of imperial expansion in the highly symbolic frontispiece dee included a figure of britannia kneeling by the shore beseeching elizabeth i to protect her empire by strengthening her navy dee used geoffreys inclusion of ireland in arthurs imperial conquests to argue that arthur had established a british empire abroad he further argued that england exploit new lands through colonisation and that this vision could become reality through maritime supremacy dee has been credited with the coining of the term british empire however humphrey llwyd has also been credited with the first use of the term in his commentarioli britannicae descriptionis fragmentum published eight years earlier in  dee posited a formal claim to north america on the back of a map drawn in – he noted circa  mr robert thorn his father and mr eliot of bristow discovered newfound land in his title royal of  he invented the claim that madog ab owain gwynedd had discovered america with the intention of ensuring that englands claim to the new world was stronger than that of spain he further asserted that brutus of britain and king arthur as well as madog had conquered lands in the americas and therefore their heir elizabeth i of england had a priority claim there reputation and significanceedit about ten years after dees death the antiquarian robert cotton purchased land around dees house and began digging in search of papers and artifacts he discovered several manuscripts mainly records of dees angelic communications cottons son gave these manuscripts to the scholar méric casaubon who published them in  together with a long introduction critical of their author as a true  faithful relation of what passed for many yeers between dr john dee a mathematician of great fame in q eliz and king james their reignes and some spirits as the first public revelation of dees spiritual conferences the book was extremely popular and sold quickly casaubon who believed in the reality of spirits argued in his introduction that dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels this book is largely responsible for the image prevalent for the following two and a half centuries of dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic around the same time the true and faithful relation was published members of the rosicrucian movement claimed dee as one of their number there is doubt however that an organized rosicrucian movement existed during dees lifetime and no evidence that he ever belonged to any secret fraternity dees reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with edward kelley have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to fabulists writers of horror stories and latterday magicians the accretion of false and often fanciful information about dee often obscures the facts of his life remarkable as they are in themselves it also does nothing to promote his christian leanings dee looked to the angels to speak to him about how he might heal the very deep and serious rifts between the roman catholic church the reformed church of england and the protestant movement in england queen elizabeth i used him as her court astronomer on a number of occasions not solely because he practised hermetic arts but because he was a deeply religious and learned man whom she trusted a reevaluation of dees character and significance came in the th century largely as a result of the work of the historians charlotte fellsmith and dame frances yates both writers brought into focus the parallel roles magic science and religion held in the elizabethan renaissance fellsmith writes there is perhaps no learned author in history who has been so persistently misjudged nay even slandered by his posterity and not a voice in all the three centuries uplifted even to claim for him a fair hearing surely it is time that the cause of all this universal condemnation should be examined in the light of reason and science and perhaps it will be found to exist mainly in the fact that he was too far advanced in speculative thought for his own age to understand  as a result of this and subsequent reevaluation dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and bookcollector a devoted christian albeit during a very confusing time for that faith an able scientist and one of the most learned men of his day his personal library at mortlake was the largest in the country before it was vandalized and was created at enormous and sometimes ruinous personal expense it was considered one of the finest in europe perhaps second only to that of de thou as well as being an astrological and scientific advisor to elizabeth and her court he was an early advocate of the colonisation of north america and a visionary of a british empire stretching across the north atlantic dee promoted the sciences of navigation and cartography he studied closely with gerardus mercator and he owned an important collection of maps globes and astronomical instruments he developed new instruments as well as special navigational techniques for use in polar regions dee served as an advisor to the english voyages of discovery and personally selected pilots and trained them in navigation he believed that mathematics which he understood mystically was central to the progress of human learning the centrality of mathematics to dees vision makes him to that extent more modern than francis bacon though some scholars believe bacon purposely downplayed mathematics in the antioccult atmosphere of the reign of james i it should be noted though that dees understanding of the role of mathematics is radically different from our contemporary view dees promotion of mathematics outside the universities was an enduring practical achievement as with most of his writings dee chose to write in english rather than latin to make his writings accessible to the general public his mathematical preface to euclid was meant to promote the study and application of mathematics by those without a university education and was very popular and influential among the mecanicians the new and growing class of technical craftsmen and artisans dees preface included demonstrations of mathematical principles that readers could perform themselves without special education or training during the th century the municipal borough of richmond now the london borough of richmond upon thames honoured john dee by naming a street near mortlake where he lived dee road after him calendaredit dee was a friend of tycho brahe and was familiar with the work translated into english by his ward and assistant thomas digges of nicolaus copernicus many of his astronomical calculations were based on copernican assumptions but he never openly espoused the heliocentric theory dee applied copernican theory to the problem of calendar reform in  he was asked to advise the queen about the new gregorian calendar that had been promulgated by pope gregory xiii from october  his advice was that england should accept it albeit with seven specific amendments the first of these was that the adjustment should not be the  days that would restore the calendar to the time of the council of nicaea in  ad but by  days which would restore it to the birth of christ another proposal of dees was to align the civil and liturgical years and to have them both start on  january perhaps predictably england chose to spurn any suggestions that had papist origins despite any merit they may objectively have and dees advice was rejected voynich manuscriptedit he has often been associated with the voynich manuscript wilfrid michael voynich who bought the manuscript in  suggested that dee may have owned the manuscript and sold it to rudolph ii dees contacts with rudolph were far less extensive than had previously been thought however and dees diaries show no evidence of the sale dee was however known to have possessed a copy of the book of soyga another enciphered book worksedit monas hieroglyphica  preface to billingsleys euclid billingsleys translation of

walpole jennifer rampling has claimed that dee never actually owned this objectcitation needed the item now residing in the british museum was first attributed to dee by horace walpole lord frederick campbell had brought a round piece of shining black marble in a leathern case to walpole in an attempt to ascertain the objects provenance according to walpole he responded saying oh lord i am the only man in england that can tell you it is dr dees black stone there is no explicit reference to the mirror in any of dees surviving writings the provenance of the museums obsidian speculum as well

manchester alma mater st johns college cambridge louvain university academic advisors gemma frisius gerardus mercator notable students thomas digges known for advisor to queen elizabeth i john dee  july  –  or  was an english mathematician astronomer astrologer occult philosopher and advisor to queen elizabeth i he devoted much of his life to the study of alchemy divination and hermetic philosophy he was also an advocate of englands imperial expansion into a british empire a term he is generally credited with coining dee straddled the worlds of science and magic just as they were becoming distinguishable one of the most learned men of his age he had been invited to lecture on the geometry of euclid at the university of paris while still in his early twenties dee was an ardent promoter of mathematics and a respected astronomer as well as a leading expert in navigation having trained many of those who would conduct englands voyages of discovery simultaneously with these efforts dee immersed himself in the worlds of magic astrology and hermetic philosophy he devoted much time and effort in the last thirty years or so of his life to attempting to commune with angels in order to learn the universal language of creation and bring about the preapocalyptic unity of mankind a student of the renaissance neoplatonism of marsilio ficino dee did not draw distinctions between his mathematical research and his investigations into hermetic magic angel summoning and divination instead he considered all of his activities to constitute different facets of the same quest the search for a transcendent understanding of the divine forms which underlie the visible world which dee called pure verities in his lifetime dee amassed one of the largest libraries in england his high status as a scholar also allowed him to play a role in elizabethan politics he served as an occasional advisor and tutor to elizabeth i and nurtured relationships with her ministers francis walsingham and william cecil dee also tutored and enjoyed patronage relationships with sir philip sidney his uncle robert dudley st earl of leicester and edward dyer he also enjoyed patronage from sir

biographyedit early lifeedit dee was born in tower ward london to rowland dee of welsh descent and johanna wild his surname dee derived from the welsh du black his grandfather was bedo ddu of nantygroes pilleth radnorshire and john retained his connection with the locality his father roland was a mercer and gentleman courtier to henry viii john dee claimed to be a descendant of rhodri the great prince of wales and constructed a pedigree showing his descent from rhodri dees family arrived in london in the wake of henry tudors coronation as henry vii jane dee was the daughter of william wild dee attended the chelmsford chantry school now king edward vi grammar school from  to  he entered st johns college cambridge in november  aged  graduating ba in  or early  his abilities recognised he became an original fellow of trinity college cambridge on its founding by henry viii in  at trinity the clever stage effects he produced for a production of aristophanes peace procured him the reputation of being a magician that clung to him through life in the late s and early s he travelled in europe studying at louvain  and brussels and lecturing in paris on euclid he studied with gemma frisius and became a close friend of the cartographer gerardus mercator and cartographer abraham ortelius returning to england with an important collection of mathematical and astronomical instruments in  he met gerolamo cardano in london during their acquaintance they investigated a perpetual motion machine as well as a gem purported to have magical properties rector at uptonuponsevern from  dee was offered a readership in mathematics at oxford in  which he declined he was occupied with writing and perhaps hoped for a better position at court in  dee became a member of the worshipful company of mercers as his father had through the companys system of patrimony that same year  he was arrested and charged with calculating for having cast horoscopes of queen mary and princess elizabeth the charges were expanded to treason against mary dee appeared in the star chamber and exonerated himself but was turned over to the catholic bishop bonner for religious examination his strong and lifelong penchant for secrecy perhaps worsening matters this entire episode was only the most dramatic in a series of attacks and slanders that would dog dee throughout his life clearing his name yet again he soon became a close associate of bonner dee presented queen mary with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library in  but his proposal was not taken up instead he expanded his personal library at his house in mortlake tirelessly acquiring books and manuscripts in england and on the european continent dees library a centre of learning outside the universities became the greatest in england and attracted many scholars dees glyph whose meaning he explained in monas hieroglyphica when elizabeth took the throne in  dee became her trusted advisor on astrological and scientific matters choosing elizabeths coronation date himself from the s through the s he served as an advisor to englands voyages of discovery providing technical assistance in navigation and ideological backing in the creation of a british empire a term that he was the first to use dee wrote a letter to william cecil st baron burghley in october  seeking patronage he claimed to have occult knowledge of treasure in the welsh marches and of valuable ancient manuscripts kept at wigmore castle knowing that the lord treasurers ancestors came from this area in  dee published general and rare memorials pertayning to the perfect arte of navigation a work that set out his vision of a maritime empire and asserted english territorial claims on the new world dee was acquainted with humphrey gilbert and was close to sir philip sidney and his circle in  dee wrote the hermetic work monas hieroglyphica the hieroglyphic monad an exhaustive cabalistic interpretation of a glyph of his own design meant to express the mystical unity of all creation having dedicated it to maximilian ii holy roman emperor in an effort to gain patronage dee attempted to present it to him during the time of his ascension to the throne of hungary this work was esteemed by many of dees contemporaries but the work can not be interpreted today without the secret oral tradition from that era he published a mathematical preface to henry billingsleys english translation of euclids elements in  arguing the central importance of mathematics and outlining mathematics influence on the other arts and sciences intended for an audience outside the universities it proved to be dees most widely influential and frequently reprinted work later lifeedit the seal of god british museum by the early s dee was growing dissatisfied with his progress in learning the secrets of nature as well as his failing influence and recognition in court circles failure of his proposed calendar revision imperial recommendations and ambivalent results from exploration of north america had nearly brought his hopes of political patronage to an end as a result he began a more energetic turn towards the supernatural as a means to acquire knowledge specifically he sought to contact spirits through the use of a scryer or crystalgazer which would act as an intermediary between dee and the angels dees first attempts with several scryers were not satisfactory but in  he met edward kelley then going under the name of edward talbot to disguise his conviction for coining or forgery who impressed him greatly with his abilities dee took kelley into his service and began to devote all his energies to his supernatural pursuits these spiritual conferences or actions were conducted with an air of intense christian piety always after periods of purification prayer and fasting dee was convinced of the benefits they could bring to mankind the character of kelley is harder to assess some have concluded that he acted with complete cynicism but delusion or selfdeception are not out of the question kelleys output is remarkable for its sheer volume its intricacy and its vividness dee maintained that the angels laboriously dictated several books to him this way through kelley some in a special angelic or enochian language edward kelley in  dee met the visiting impoverished yet popular polish nobleman albert łaski who after overstaying his welcome at court invited dee to accompany him on his return to poland with some prompting by the angels again through kelley and his worsening status at court dee was persuaded to go dee kelley and their families left for the continent in september  but łaski proved to be bankrupt and out of favour in his own country dee and kelley began a nomadic life in central europe meanwhile continuing their spiritual conferences which dee recorded meticulously in his diaries and almanacs they had audiences with emperor rudolf ii in prague castle and king stefan batory of poland whom they attempted to convince of the importance of angelic communication the meeting with the polish king stefan batory took place at the royal castle at niepołomice near kraków then the capital of poland and was later widely analyzed by polish historians ryszard zieliński roman żelewski roman bugaj and writers waldemar łysiakcitation needed while generally dee was accepted as a man of wide and deep knowledge they mistrusted his connection with the english monarch elizabeth i they could not be sure that their meetings were without political ramifications some thought and still do that dee was in fact a spy for the british monarch nevertheless the polish king a devout catholic and very cautious of supernatural media began their meetings with the affirmation that any prophetic revelations must be in keeping with the teachings of jesus christ the mission of the holy catholic church and the approval of the pope in  during a spiritual conference in bohemia kelley informed dee that the angel uriel had ordered the men to share all their possessions including their wives by this time kelley had gained some renown as an alchemist and in fact was more soughtafter than dee in this regard this was a line of work that had prospects for serious and longterm financial gain especially among the royal families of central europe dee on the other hand was more interested in communicating with the angels who he believed would help him solve the mysteries of the heavens through mathematics optics astrology science and navigation it may be that kelley in fact wished to end dees dependence on him as a scryer for their increasingly lengthy and frequent spiritual conferences the order for wifesharing caused dee great anguish but he apparently did not doubt its genuineness they apparently did share wives however dee broke off the conferences immediately afterwards dee returned to england in  kelley went on to be the alchemist for emperor rudolf ii nine months later on feb   a son was born to dees wife whom dee baptized theodorus trebonianus dee and raised as his own it is possible that this child was kelleys dee was  at the time edward kelley was  final yearsedit dees obsidian aztec scrying mirror john dee memorial plaque installed in  inside the church of st mary the virgin mortlake dee returned to mortlake after six years abroad to find his home vandalized his library ruined and many of his prized books and instruments stolen furthermore dee found that increasing criticism of occult practices had made england even more inhospitable to his magical practices and natural philosophy dee sought support from elizabeth who hoped he could persuade kelley to return and ease englands economic burdens through alchemy she finally appointed dee warden of christs college manchester in  this former college of priests had been reestablished as a protestant institution by a royal charter of  however he could not exert much control over the fellows of that college who despised or cheated him early in his tenure he was consulted on the demonic possession of seven children but took little interest in the matter although he did allow those involved to consult his still extensive library he left manchester in  to return to london however he remained warden until his death by that time elizabeth was dead and james i provided no support dee spent his final years in poverty at mortlake forced to sell off various of his possessions to support himself and his daughter katherine who cared for him until the end he died in mortlake late in  or early  aged  there are no extant records of the exact date as both the parish registers and dees gravestone are missing in  a memorial plaque to dee was placed on the south wall of the present church personal lifeedit dee was married three times and had eight children he first married katherine constable in  she died in  and their union resulted in no children his second also childless marriage to an unknown woman lasted only a year until her death in  from  to  dee kept a sporadic diary also referred to as his almanac from which most of what we know about his life during that time has been gleaned in  he married the yearold jane fromond dee was fiftyone at the time jane had her own connections to the elizabethan court she was a lady in waiting to elizabeth clinton countess of lincoln a position she gave up when she married dee when in  kelley informed dee of the angels wish that they share wives jane dee née fromond was the wife dee shared with him although dee complied with the angels supposed request for a while he was apparently distressed by the arrangement and it was one reason why the two men parted company not long thereafter some believe that dees son theodore born nine months later could have been kelleys son not dees jane died in manchester of the bubonic plague and was buried in the manchester cathedral burial grounds in march  michael born in prague died on his fathers birthday in  theodore born in trebona died in manchester in  his sons arthur dee and rowland survived him as did his daughter katherine who was his companion to the end no records exist for his youngest daughters madinia frances and margaret after  so it is widely assumed they died in the same epidemic that took their mother dee had by this time ceased keeping his diary while arthur was a student at the westminster school dee wrote a letter to his headmaster that echoes the worries of boarding school parents in every century arthur was an apprentice in much of his fathers alchemical and scientific work and was in fact often his scryer until kelley came along arthur went on to become an alchemist and hermetic author whose works were published by elias ashmole as regards dees physical appearance the antiquary john aubrey gives the following description he was tall and slender he wore a gown like an artists gown with hanging sleeves and a slit a very fair clear sanguine complexion a long beard as white as milk a very handsome man achievementsedit a chart from johannes trithemiuss steganographia in the hand of john dee who copied the entire manuscript in  thoughtedit dee was influenced by the hermetic and platonicpythagorean doctrines that were pervasive in the renaissance he believed that numbers were the basis of all things and the key to knowledge from hermeticism he drew the belief that man had the potential for divine power and he believed this divine power could be exercised through mathematics his ultimate goal was to help bring forth a unified world religion through the healing of the breach of the catholic and protestant churches and the recapture of the pure theology of the ancients advocacy of english expansionedit from  dee advocated a policy of political and economic strengthening of england and imperial expansion into the new world in his manuscript brytannicae reipublicae synopsis  he outlined the current state of the elizabethan realm and was concerned with trade ethics and national strength his  general and rare memorials pertayning to the perfect arte of navigation was the first volume in an unfinished series planned to advocate the rise of imperial expansion in the highly symbolic frontispiece dee included a figure of britannia kneeling by the shore beseeching elizabeth i to protect her empire by strengthening her navy dee used geoffreys inclusion of ireland in arthurs imperial conquests to argue that arthur had established a british empire abroad he further argued that england exploit new lands through colonisation and that this vision could become reality through maritime supremacy dee has been credited with the coining of the term british empire however humphrey llwyd has also been credited with the first use of the term in his commentarioli britannicae descriptionis fragmentum published eight years earlier in  dee posited a formal claim to north america on the back of a map drawn in – he noted circa  mr robert thorn his father and mr eliot of bristow discovered newfound land in his title royal of  he invented the claim that madog ab owain gwynedd had discovered america with the intention of ensuring that englands claim to the new world was stronger than that of spain he further asserted that brutus of britain and king arthur as well as madog had conquered lands in the americas and therefore their heir elizabeth i of england had a priority claim there reputation and significanceedit about ten years after dees death the antiquarian robert cotton purchased land around dees house and began digging in search of papers and artifacts he discovered several manuscripts mainly records of dees angelic communications cottons son gave these manuscripts to the scholar méric casaubon who published them in  together with a long introduction critical of their author as a true  faithful relation of what passed for many yeers between dr john dee a mathematician of great fame in q eliz and king james their reignes and some spirits as the first public revelation of dees spiritual conferences the book was extremely popular and sold quickly casaubon who believed in the reality of spirits argued in his introduction that dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels this book is largely responsible for the image prevalent for the following two and a half centuries of dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic around the same time the true and faithful relation was published members of the rosicrucian movement claimed dee as one of their number there is doubt however that an organized rosicrucian movement existed during dees lifetime and no evidence that he ever belonged to any secret fraternity dees reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with edward kelley have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to fabulists writers of horror stories and latterday magicians the accretion of false and often fanciful information about dee often obscures the facts of his life remarkable as they are in themselves it also does nothing to promote his christian leanings dee looked to the angels to speak to him about how he might heal the very deep and serious rifts between the roman catholic church the reformed church of england and the protestant movement in england queen elizabeth i used him as her court astronomer on a number of occasions not solely because he practised hermetic arts but because he was a deeply religious and learned man whom she trusted a reevaluation of dees character and significance came in the th century largely as a result of the work of the historians charlotte fellsmith and dame frances yates both writers brought into focus the parallel roles magic science and religion held in the elizabethan renaissance fellsmith writes there is perhaps no learned author in history who has been so persistently misjudged nay even slandered by his posterity and not a voice in all the three centuries uplifted even to claim for him a fair hearing surely it is time that the cause of all this universal condemnation should be examined in the light of reason and science and perhaps it will be found to exist mainly in the fact that he was too far advanced in speculative thought for his own age to understand  as a result of this and subsequent reevaluation dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and bookcollector a devoted christian albeit during a very confusing time for that faith an able scientist and one of the most learned men of his day his personal library at mortlake was the largest in the country before it was vandalized and was created at enormous and sometimes ruinous personal expense it was considered one of the finest in europe perhaps second only to that of de thou as well as being an astrological and scientific advisor to elizabeth and her court he was an early advocate of the colonisation of north america and a visionary of a british empire stretching across the north atlantic dee promoted the sciences of navigation and cartography he studied closely with gerardus mercator and he owned an important collection of maps globes and astronomical instruments he developed new instruments as well as special navigational techniques for use in polar regions dee served as an advisor to the english voyages of discovery and personally selected pilots and trained them in navigation he believed that mathematics which he understood mystically was central to the progress of human learning the centrality of mathematics to dees vision makes him to that extent more modern than francis bacon though some scholars believe bacon purposely downplayed mathematics in the antioccult atmosphere of the reign of james i it should be noted though that dees understanding of the role of mathematics is radically different from our contemporary view dees promotion of mathematics outside the universities was an enduring practical achievement as with most of his writings dee chose to write in english rather than latin to make his writings accessible to the general public his mathematical preface to euclid was meant to promote the study and application of mathematics by those without a university education and was very popular and influential among the mecanicians the new and growing class of technical craftsmen and artisans dees preface included demonstrations of mathematical principles that readers could perform themselves without special education or training during the th century the municipal borough of richmond now the london borough of richmond upon thames honoured john dee by naming a street near mortlake where he lived dee road after him calendaredit dee was a friend of tycho brahe and was familiar with the work translated into english by his ward and assistant thomas digges of nicolaus copernicus many of his astronomical calculations were based on copernican assumptions but he never openly espoused the heliocentric theory dee applied copernican theory to the problem of calendar reform in  he was asked to advise the queen about the new gregorian calendar that had been promulgated by pope gregory xiii from october  his advice was that england should accept it albeit with seven specific amendments the first of these was that the adjustment should not be the  days that would restore the calendar to the time of the council of nicaea in  ad but by  days which would restore it to the birth of christ another proposal of dees was to align the civil and liturgical years and to have them both start on  january perhaps predictably england chose to spurn any suggestions that had papist origins despite any merit they may objectively have and dees advice was rejected voynich manuscriptedit he has often been associated with the voynich manuscript wilfrid michael voynich who bought the manuscript in  suggested that dee may have owned the manuscript and sold it to rudolph ii dees contacts with rudolph were far less extensive than had previously been thought however and dees diaries show no evidence of the sale dee was however known to have possessed a copy of the book of soyga another enciphered book worksedit monas hieroglyphica  preface to billingsleys euclid billingsleys translation of euclids elements  on the mystical rule of the seven planets – artefactsedit objects used by dee in his magic now in the british museum the british museum holds several items once owned by dee and associated with the spiritual conferences dees speculum or mirror an obsidian aztec cult object in the shape of a handmirror brought to europe in the late s which was subsequently owned by horace walpole jennifer rampling has claimed that dee never actually owned this objectcitation needed the item now residing in the british museum was first attributed to dee by horace walpole lord frederick campbell had brought a round piece of shining black marble in a leathern case to walpole in an attempt to ascertain the objects provenance according to walpole he responded saying oh lord i am the only man in england that can tell you it is dr dees black stone there is no explicit reference to the mirror in any of dees surviving writings the provenance of the museums obsidian speculum as well as the crystal ball is in fact dubiouscitation needed the small wax seals used to support the legs of dees table of practice the table at which the scrying was performed the large elaborately decorated wax seal of god used to support the shewstone the crystal ball used for scrying a gold amulet engraved with a representation of one of kelleys visions a crystal globe six centimetres in

manchester alma mater st johns college cambridge louvain university academic advisors gemma frisius gerardus mercator notable students thomas digges known for advisor to queen elizabeth i john dee  july  –  or  was an english mathematician astronomer astrologer occult philosopher and advisor to queen elizabeth i he devoted much of his life to the study of alchemy divination and hermetic philosophy he was also an advocate of englands imperial expansion into a british empire a term he is generally credited with coining dee straddled the worlds of science and magic just as they were becoming distinguishable one of the most learned men of his age he had been invited to lecture on the geometry of euclid at the university of paris while still in his early twenties dee was an ardent promoter of mathematics and a respected astronomer as well as a leading expert in navigation having trained many of those who would conduct englands voyages of discovery simultaneously with these efforts dee immersed himself in the worlds of magic astrology and hermetic philosophy he devoted much time and effort in the last thirty years or so of his life to attempting to commune with angels in order to learn the universal language of creation and bring about the preapocalyptic unity of mankind a student of the renaissance neoplatonism of marsilio ficino dee did not draw distinctions between his mathematical research and his investigations into hermetic magic angel summoning and divination instead he considered all of his activities to constitute different facets of the same quest the search for a transcendent understanding of the divine forms which underlie the visible world which dee called pure verities in his lifetime dee amassed one of the largest libraries in england his high status as a scholar also allowed him to play a role in elizabethan politics he served as an occasional advisor and tutor to elizabeth i and nurtured relationships with her ministers francis walsingham and william cecil dee also tutored and enjoyed patronage relationships with sir philip sidney his uncle robert dudley st earl of leicester and edward dyer he also enjoyed patronage from sir

biographyedit early lifeedit dee was born in tower ward london to rowland dee of welsh descent and johanna wild his surname dee derived from the welsh du black his grandfather was bedo ddu of nantygroes pilleth radnorshire and john retained his connection with the locality his father roland was a mercer and gentleman courtier to henry viii john dee claimed to be a descendant of rhodri the great prince of wales and constructed a pedigree showing his descent from rhodri dees family arrived in london in the wake of henry tudors coronation as henry vii jane dee was the daughter of william wild dee attended the chelmsford chantry school now king edward vi grammar school from  to  he entered st johns college cambridge in november  aged  graduating ba in  or early  his abilities recognised he became an original fellow of trinity college cambridge on its founding by henry viii in  at trinity the clever stage effects he produced for a production of aristophanes peace procured him the reputation of being a magician that clung to him through life in the late s and early s he travelled in europe studying at louvain  and brussels and lecturing in paris on euclid he studied with gemma frisius and became a close friend of the cartographer gerardus mercator and cartographer abraham ortelius returning to england with an important collection of mathematical and astronomical instruments in  he met gerolamo cardano in london during their acquaintance they investigated a perpetual motion machine as well as a gem purported to have magical properties rector at uptonuponsevern from  dee was offered a readership in mathematics at oxford in  which he declined he was occupied with writing and perhaps hoped for a better position at court in  dee became a member of the worshipful company of mercers as his father had through the companys system of patrimony that same year  he was arrested and charged with calculating for having cast horoscopes of queen mary and princess elizabeth the charges were expanded to treason against mary dee appeared in the star chamber and exonerated himself but was turned over to the catholic bishop bonner for religious examination his strong and lifelong penchant for secrecy perhaps worsening matters this entire episode was only the most dramatic in a series of attacks and slanders that would dog dee throughout his life clearing his name yet again he soon became a close associate of bonner dee presented queen mary with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library in  but his proposal was not taken up instead he expanded his personal library at his house in mortlake tirelessly acquiring books and manuscripts in england and on the european continent dees library a centre of learning outside the universities became the greatest in england and attracted many scholars dees glyph whose meaning he explained in monas hieroglyphica when elizabeth took the throne in  dee became her trusted advisor on astrological and scientific matters choosing elizabeths coronation date himself from the s through the s he served as an advisor to englands voyages of discovery providing technical assistance in navigation and ideological backing in the creation of a british empire a term that he was the first to use dee wrote a letter to william cecil st baron burghley in october  seeking patronage he claimed to have occult knowledge of treasure in the welsh marches and of valuable ancient manuscripts kept at wigmore castle knowing that the lord treasurers ancestors came from this area in  dee published general and rare memorials pertayning to the perfect arte of navigation a work that set out his vision of a maritime empire and asserted english territorial claims on the new world dee was acquainted with humphrey gilbert and was close to sir philip sidney and his circle in  dee wrote the hermetic work monas hieroglyphica the hieroglyphic monad an exhaustive cabalistic interpretation of a glyph of his own design meant to express the mystical unity of all creation having dedicated it to maximilian ii holy roman emperor in an effort to gain patronage dee attempted to present it to him during the time of his ascension to the throne of hungary this work was esteemed by many of dees contemporaries but the work can not be interpreted today without the secret oral tradition from that era he published a mathematical preface to henry billingsleys english translation of euclids elements in  arguing the central importance of mathematics and outlining mathematics influence on the other arts and sciences intended for an audience outside the universities it proved to be dees most widely influential and frequently reprinted work later lifeedit the seal of god british museum by the early s dee was growing dissatisfied with his progress in learning the secrets of nature as well as his failing influence and recognition in court circles failure of his proposed calendar revision imperial recommendations and ambivalent results from exploration of north america had nearly brought his hopes of political patronage to an end as a result he began a more energetic turn towards the supernatural as a means to acquire knowledge specifically he sought to contact spirits through the use of a scryer or crystalgazer which would act as an intermediary between dee and the angels dees first attempts with several scryers were not satisfactory but in  he met edward kelley then going under the name of edward talbot to disguise his conviction for coining or forgery who impressed him greatly with his abilities dee took kelley into his service and began to devote all his energies to his supernatural pursuits these spiritual conferences or actions were conducted with an air of intense christian piety always after periods of purification prayer and fasting dee was convinced of the benefits they could bring to mankind the character of kelley is harder to assess some have concluded that he acted with complete cynicism but delusion or selfdeception are not out of the question kelleys output is remarkable for its sheer volume its intricacy and its vividness dee maintained that the angels laboriously dictated several books to him this way through kelley some in a special angelic or enochian language edward kelley in  dee met the visiting impoverished yet popular polish nobleman albert łaski who after overstaying his welcome at court invited dee to accompany him on his return to poland with some prompting by the angels again through kelley and his worsening status at court dee was persuaded to go dee kelley and their families left for the continent in september  but łaski proved to be bankrupt and out of favour in his own country dee and kelley began a nomadic life in central europe meanwhile continuing their spiritual conferences which dee recorded meticulously in his diaries and almanacs they had audiences with emperor rudolf ii in prague castle and king stefan batory of poland whom they attempted to convince of the importance of angelic communication the meeting with the polish king stefan batory took place at the royal castle at niepołomice near kraków then the capital of poland and was later widely analyzed by polish historians ryszard zieliński roman żelewski roman bugaj and writers waldemar łysiakcitation needed while generally dee was accepted as a man of wide and deep knowledge they mistrusted his connection with the english monarch elizabeth i they could not be sure that their meetings were without political ramifications some thought and still do that dee was in fact a spy for the british monarch nevertheless the polish king a devout catholic and very cautious of supernatural media began their meetings with the affirmation that any prophetic revelations must be in keeping with the teachings of jesus christ the mission of the holy catholic church and the approval of the pope in  during a spiritual conference in bohemia kelley informed dee that the angel uriel had ordered the men to share all their possessions including their wives by this time kelley had gained some renown as an alchemist and in fact was more soughtafter than dee in this regard this was a line of work that had prospects for serious and longterm financial gain especially among the royal families of central europe dee on the other hand was more interested in communicating with the angels who he believed would help him solve the mysteries of the heavens through mathematics optics astrology science and navigation it may be that kelley in fact wished to end dees dependence on him as a scryer for their increasingly lengthy and frequent spiritual conferences the order for wifesharing caused dee great anguish but he apparently did not doubt its genuineness they apparently did share wives however dee broke off the conferences immediately afterwards dee returned to england in  kelley went on to be the alchemist for emperor rudolf ii nine months later on feb   a son was born to dees wife whom dee baptized theodorus trebonianus dee and raised as his own it is possible that this child was kelleys dee was  at the time edward kelley was  final yearsedit dees obsidian aztec scrying mirror john dee memorial plaque installed in  inside the church of st mary the virgin mortlake dee returned to mortlake after six years abroad to find his home vandalized his library ruined and many of his prized books and instruments stolen furthermore dee found that increasing criticism of occult practices had made england even more inhospitable to his magical practices and natural philosophy dee sought support from elizabeth who hoped he could persuade kelley to return and ease englands economic burdens through alchemy she finally appointed dee warden of christs college manchester in  this former college of priests had been reestablished as a protestant institution by a royal charter of  however he could not exert much control over the fellows of that college who despised or cheated him early in his tenure he was consulted on the demonic possession of seven children but took little interest in the matter although he did allow those involved to consult his still extensive library he left manchester in  to return to london however he remained warden until his death by that time elizabeth was dead and james i provided no support dee spent his final years in poverty at mortlake forced to sell off various of his possessions to support himself and his daughter katherine who cared for him until the end he died in mortlake late in  or early  aged  there are no extant records of the exact date as both the parish registers and dees gravestone are missing in  a memorial plaque to dee was placed on the south wall of the present church personal lifeedit dee was married three times and had eight children he first married katherine constable in  she died in  and their union resulted in no children his second also childless marriage to an unknown woman lasted only a year until her death in  from  to  dee kept a sporadic diary also referred to as his almanac from which most of what we know about his life during that time has been gleaned in  he married the yearold jane fromond dee was fiftyone at the time jane had her own connections to the elizabethan court she was a lady in waiting to elizabeth clinton countess of lincoln a position she gave up when she married dee when in  kelley informed dee of the angels wish that they share wives jane dee née fromond was the wife dee shared with him although dee complied with the angels supposed request for a while he was apparently distressed by the arrangement and it was one reason why the two men parted company not long thereafter some believe that dees son theodore born nine months later could have been kelleys son not dees jane died in manchester of the bubonic plague and was buried in the manchester cathedral burial grounds in march  michael born in prague died on his fathers birthday in  theodore born in trebona died in manchester in  his sons arthur dee and rowland survived him as did his daughter katherine who was his companion to the end no records exist for his youngest daughters madinia frances and margaret after  so it is widely assumed they died in the same epidemic that took their mother dee had by this time ceased keeping his diary while arthur was a student at the westminster school dee wrote a letter to his headmaster that echoes the worries of boarding school parents in every century arthur was an apprentice in much of his fathers alchemical and scientific work and was in fact often his scryer until kelley came along arthur went on to become an alchemist and hermetic author whose works were published by elias ashmole as regards dees physical appearance the antiquary john aubrey gives the following description he was tall and slender he wore a gown like an artists gown with hanging sleeves and a slit a very fair clear sanguine complexion a long beard as white as milk a very handsome man achievementsedit a chart from johannes trithemiuss steganographia in the hand of john dee who copied the entire manuscript in  thoughtedit dee was influenced by the hermetic and platonicpythagorean doctrines that were pervasive in the renaissance he believed that numbers were the basis of all things and the key to knowledge from hermeticism he drew the belief that man had the potential for divine power and he believed this divine power could be exercised through mathematics his ultimate goal was to help bring forth a unified world religion through the healing of the breach of the catholic and protestant churches and the recapture of the pure theology of the ancients advocacy of english expansionedit from  dee advocated a policy of political and economic strengthening of england and imperial expansion into the new world in his manuscript brytannicae reipublicae synopsis  he outlined the current state of the elizabethan realm and was concerned with trade ethics and national strength his  general and rare memorials pertayning to the perfect arte of navigation was the first volume in an unfinished series planned to advocate the rise of imperial expansion in the highly symbolic frontispiece dee included a figure of britannia kneeling by the shore beseeching elizabeth i to protect her empire by strengthening her navy dee used geoffreys inclusion of ireland in arthurs imperial conquests to argue that arthur had established a british empire abroad he further argued that england exploit new lands through colonisation and that this vision could become reality through maritime supremacy dee has been credited with the coining of the term british empire however humphrey llwyd has also been credited with the first use of the term in his commentarioli britannicae descriptionis fragmentum published eight years earlier in  dee posited a formal claim to north america on the back of a map drawn in – he noted circa  mr robert thorn his father and mr eliot of bristow discovered newfound land in his title royal of  he invented the claim that madog ab owain gwynedd had discovered america with the intention of ensuring that englands claim to the new world was stronger than that of spain he further asserted that brutus of britain and king arthur as well as madog had conquered lands in the americas and therefore their heir elizabeth i of england had a priority claim there reputation and significanceedit about ten years after dees death the antiquarian robert cotton purchased land around dees house and began digging in search of papers and artifacts he discovered several manuscripts mainly records of dees angelic communications cottons son gave these manuscripts to the scholar méric casaubon who published them in  together with a long introduction critical of their author as a true  faithful relation of what passed for many yeers between dr john dee a mathematician of great fame in q eliz and king james their reignes and some spirits as the first public revelation of dees spiritual conferences the book was extremely popular and sold quickly casaubon who believed in the reality of spirits argued in his introduction that dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels this book is largely responsible for the image prevalent for the following two and a half centuries of dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic around the same time the true and faithful relation was published members of the rosicrucian movement claimed dee as one of their number there is doubt however that an organized rosicrucian movement existed during dees lifetime and no evidence that he ever belonged to any secret fraternity dees reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with edward kelley have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to fabulists writers of horror stories and latterday magicians the accretion of false and often fanciful information about dee often obscures the facts of his life remarkable as they are in themselves it also does nothing to promote his christian leanings dee looked to the angels to speak to him about how he might heal the very deep and serious rifts between the roman catholic church the reformed church of england and the protestant movement in england queen elizabeth i used him as her court astronomer on a number of occasions not solely because he practised hermetic arts but because he was a deeply religious and learned man whom she trusted a reevaluation of dees character and significance came in the th century largely as a result of the work of the historians charlotte fellsmith and dame frances yates both writers brought into focus the parallel roles magic science and religion held in the elizabethan renaissance fellsmith writes there is perhaps no learned author in history who has been so persistently misjudged nay even slandered by his posterity and not a voice in all the three centuries uplifted even to claim for him a fair hearing surely it is time that the cause of all this universal condemnation should be examined in the light of reason and science and perhaps it will be found to exist mainly in the fact that he was too far advanced in speculative thought for his own age to understand  as a result of this and subsequent reevaluation dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and bookcollector a devoted christian albeit during a very confusing time for that faith an able scientist and one of the most learned men of his day his personal library at mortlake was the largest in the country before it was vandalized and was created at enormous and sometimes ruinous personal expense it was considered one of the finest in europe perhaps second only to that of de thou as well as being an astrological and scientific advisor to elizabeth and her court he was an early advocate of the colonisation of north america and a visionary of a british empire stretching across the north atlantic dee promoted the sciences of navigation and cartography he studied closely with gerardus mercator and he owned an important collection of maps globes and astronomical instruments he developed new instruments as well as special navigational techniques for use in polar regions dee served as an advisor to the english voyages of discovery and personally selected pilots and trained them in navigation he believed that mathematics which he understood mystically was central to the progress of human learning the centrality of mathematics to dees vision makes him to that extent more modern than francis bacon though some scholars believe bacon purposely downplayed mathematics in the antioccult atmosphere of the reign of james i it should be noted though that dees understanding of the role of mathematics is radically different from our contemporary view dees promotion of mathematics outside the universities was an enduring practical achievement as with most of his writings dee chose to write in english rather than latin to make his writings accessible to the general public his mathematical preface to euclid was meant to promote the study and application of mathematics by those without a university education and was very popular and influential among the mecanicians the new and growing class of technical craftsmen and artisans dees preface included demonstrations of mathematical principles that readers could perform themselves without special education or training during the th century the municipal borough of richmond now the london borough of richmond upon thames honoured john dee by naming a street near mortlake where he lived dee road after him calendaredit dee was a friend of tycho brahe and was familiar with the work translated into english by his ward and assistant thomas digges of nicolaus copernicus many of his astronomical calculations were based on copernican assumptions but he never openly espoused the heliocentric theory dee applied copernican theory to the problem of calendar reform in  he was asked to advise the queen about the new gregorian calendar that had been promulgated by pope gregory xiii from october  his advice was that england should accept it albeit with seven specific amendments the first of these was that the adjustment should not be the  days that would restore the calendar to the time of the council of nicaea in  ad but by  days which would restore it to the birth of christ another proposal of dees was to align the civil and liturgical years and to have them both start on  january perhaps predictably england chose to spurn any suggestions that had papist origins despite any merit they may objectively have and dees advice was rejected voynich manuscriptedit he has often been associated with the voynich manuscript wilfrid michael voynich who bought the manuscript in  suggested that dee may have owned the manuscript and sold it to rudolph ii dees contacts with rudolph were far less extensive than had previously been thought however and dees diaries show no evidence of the sale dee was however known to have possessed a copy of the book of soyga another enciphered book worksedit monas hieroglyphica  preface to billingsleys euclid billingsleys translation of

associated with the spiritual conferences dees speculum or mirror an obsidian aztec cult object in the shape of a handmirror brought to europe in the late s which was subsequently owned by horace walpole jennifer rampling has claimed that dee never actually owned this objectcitation needed the item now residing in the british museum was first attributed to dee by horace walpole lord frederick campbell had brought a round piece of shining black marble in a leathern case to walpole in an attempt to ascertain the objects provenance according to walpole he responded saying oh lord i am the only man in england that can tell you it is dr dees black stone there is no explicit reference to the mirror in any of dees surviving writings the provenance of the museums obsidian speculum as well as the crystal ball is in fact dubiouscitation needed the small wax seals used to support the legs of dees table of practice the table at which the scrying was performed the large elaborately decorated wax seal of god used to support the shewstone the crystal ball used for scrying a gold amulet engraved with a representation of one of kelleys visions a crystal globe six centimetres in diameter this item remained unnoticed for many years in the mineral collection possibly the one owned by dee but the provenance of this object is less certain than that of the others in december  both
