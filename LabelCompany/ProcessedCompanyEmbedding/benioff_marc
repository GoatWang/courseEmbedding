have thought microsoft would have been here on stage its a shock he said to laughter from the crowd im fascinated that he chose you as the representative of microsoft john thompson microsoft chairman

that young partnership at the conference which includes making salesforcecom and microsoft office apps work together with new windows and windows phone apps the reason this partnership is so shocking salesforcecom and microsoft have been bitter competitors in salesforcecoms breadandbutter market customer relationship management software that helps salespeople track contacts and make sales that competition isnt going to end either in fact a salesforce exec recently told new recruits  to view this partnership like means to grab share away from microsoft were gonna wrap our arms around

reach out to salesforcecom though the partnership may have been the brainchild of microsofts new chairman john thompson thompson became chairman when nadella was named ceo and bill gates stepped down

story explores the various ways values and social responsibility are having an impact at companies such as facebook airbnb and uber salesforce ceo marc benioff has long pushed his company and employees to make a positive difference in the world i spoke to him recently about his company’s approachadvertisementfast company you have talked about salesforce as a company with purpose beyond profit can you explain thatmarc benioff my goals for the company are to do well and do good the most important thing to me is that we bring along all our stakeholders with us we had a vision from the beginning that not only would we have a new technology model which was the cloud not only would we have a new business model which was subscription but we’d have a new philanthropic model which is  salesforce commits  of its equity employees’ time and product to nonprofit work as the ceo i need to embrace all of my stakeholders not just all of my shareholders what i’m trying to do is maximize stakeholder valuefc how does doing good help bottomline performancemb well we’re the fastest growing software company of all time so i hope it’s connected laughs if you go to my twitter page you can see the revenue chart it’s a direct connection to our values not only are we building a great product but we’re building a great company that is trying to create a great world certainly it’s a source of great talent people come to the company and stay because of the incredible opportunity and impact that they’re having on the world business is a great platform for change when a business like salesforce gets to scale with  employees and customers all over the world you have an opportunity to influence them in a positive way i do believe we’re having that impact you can see it in pledge  where the  idea has spread to thousands of companiesfc does wall street support this ideamb wall street is agnostic in terms of picking one philosophy or the other but they certainly do invest and support companies that do good work we’ve been public since  you look at our chart we’ve had a really good run and i do connect that back to the fact that we’re building a great company it is part of our differentiation as you differentiate against an sap or an oracle or a microsoft salesforce is indeed differentadvertisementfc there seems to be heightened discussion and activity from corporate leaders on policy issues in recent months is that directly related to a new administrationmb i think you saw it before that you’ve seen the rise of more activist ceos who stand for things and represent their employees and their stakeholders in the same way a politician would represent the people who vote for them i think ceos have to think this way they have to understand that they represent their stakeholders all of them they need to be able to speak and act on behalf of themwhen i went to school for business we were not taught this it was not part of my education i was taught marketing and organizational development that sort of thing i certainly was not taught stakeholder management this is something i’ve learned honestly since i started salesforcei’ll come back to the  because of  we got involved with so many nonprofits and ngos we support  of them many of these people i had never interacted with and they really impacted my consciousness how i think about the world they are working on health care and the environment and with developing nations areas where i have not spent that much time those conversations have been extremely valuable what i realized is we can help them and support them in our work as we’ve done that our employees get a much higher level of satisfaction and fulfillment knowing that they work for a company that supports thatwe give our employees the ability to have direct involvement too one of our executives just went to set up a school in africa we give them four hours a month paid time off six days a year—we’re paying them for their volunteerism that only creates a better company it’s quite selfish in many ways this has probably done more for salesforce and that’s why i encourage other ceos and entrepreneurs to take this onfc when you first started doing this  years ago it was novel do you feel the expectations on business leaders has changed since that timeadvertisementmb yes increasingly so i think you’ll see that continue to accelerate there’s a shift for ceos to be focused on all their stakeholders not just their shareholders and i think that will be more and more truefc are there cultural elements driving thismb absolutely you can look to millennials they have a desire to work for companies that have meaning yes they want a company that is making money focused on profitability and market share and all of that but also that there is meaning to their work that they’re actually improving the state of the worldwhen i was at oracle i felt deeply inside myself that there was this bifurcation i was working for this company and that was one way of life and there was another way of life that was nonprofit world or spiritual world whatever you want to call it i went on this tour of india in  talking to gurus incense wafting over us and all of a sudden it became clear to me that there was a way to integrate all of this that you could do both at the same time why do i have to be two people can’t i just be one person i want to live an integrated life i want to be an integrated leadera lot of people feel like they have multiple lives they compartmentalize i have an integrated life i have one set of values and i project that through all of my work i’m not perfect i have incongruency but i try to work on that this kind of integration is something we can all strive for i know that the work i’m doing is making the world better salesforce helps hospitals and schools and all kinds of nonprofits salesforce gives guidance to our employees to get out there and volunteer and i think that’s why we have high levels of satisfaction in our employees and why we can attract people we are creating an environment that gives them satisfaction in their work not just financial gainsfc the trust people have in government is waning is trust in business leaders growingadvertisementmb nothing is more important today for business than trust the edelman trust barometer says trust with ceos companies government is at the lowest point in a long time we are in a crisis of trust ceos get caught in this crisis of trust and it gets amplified for them that’s why i come back to that  model it brings a set of values into the company if you do have an incongruent moment you’re going to be able to seek forgiveness for that i’ve had those moments myself for those people who are only out there to make money when you hit that incongruent moment you don’t get air cover you’re going to be in trouble because you didn’t create the good karmayou have the opportunity to set up companies that do good in the world it’s easy there’s all this incredible energy in your company and you can unleash it for good if you’re not unleashing it you’re missing something i really think people are inherently good and want to give i think companies are inherently good and want to give the ability to do it is relatively straightforward all you have to do is open the doorfc so is this more important than meeting the expectations of wall streetmb you have to be able to do both it’s not an eitheror yes you better hit your revenue and earnings goals but there is no linear success if you look at my stock chart you’re going to see ups and downs but where is it over time from that same perspective your company isn’t always going to be perfect we’re human beings there are going to be problems and challenges along the way but when you aggregate it all up it’s like the stock what is your compound growth rate of your equity over the years what is your compound growth rate of good over the
