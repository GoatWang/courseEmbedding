the dots corner office by adam bryant sept   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story  this interview with mark b templeton president and ceo of citrix the internet software company was conducted and edited by adam bryant q you’ve been the chief executive of citrix since  that’s a long tenure compared to most ceo’sa i didn’t want to be ceo at first i had no interest and it was kind of accidental a lot of people i meet who have the title also have the ambition that goes with it and the desire to be ceo but i’ve never really had that ambition in my life i think there’s a bit of a lesson in it just generally in my career — and i’ve seen it in some team sports i’ve played like lacrosse and soccer — the guy who always says “give me the ball” is usually the one who probably shouldn’t have the ball it’s the guy who plays his position and is just doing his job that oftentimes is the guy you should give the ball toq why didn’t you have the ambition for the top joba it was probably a combination of two things before citrix i had a number of startup experiences one of them was as ceo and we ran out of money and i had to lay off about  people i had a pretty deep scar from that experience and i thought “ok that’s not for me” i decided that focusing on marketing and telling stories around products and understanding customers was really what i was best at advertisement continue reading the main story the other reason was that we were a public company and i didn’t really feel i was qualified to be ceo again there’s a lesson here you try as a manager to never put people in situations where it’s too big a stretch for them because it often doesn’t work out too well usually when people end up there it’s because the person who really wants the job has overestimated their own capabilities or management has overimagined someone’s capabilities and puts them there mistakenly i didn’t feel i was qualified continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story and there was a time a small gap when i lost the ceo job in the june quarter of  we really missed our expectations and by then i’d been ceo for six quarters and i was learning a lot especially about working with the board i had not kept the board informed about what was going on and some of the struggles we were having and i was trying to carry all of it myself which is what green leaders do after we missed our expectations hugely the board decided we would do a public search for a replacement and i was demoted to president and senior executive officer i deserved that because that’s part of the game being held accountable so we did a public search for a replacement and we had a candidate but the board decided they didn’t like him that was about six months in then we had a second one but the board decided that i was actually a viable candidate again they asked me if i’d be interested in having my title back it took me about a microsecond to say yesq so you were able to hit the reset button on the ceo job but with lessons learneda and what a set of lessons to learn no  remember you’re a member of the team and teams can take on big problems you don’t have to carry them yourself  in fact as ceo you have two teams your board and management and no  communication with the board is really critical to your success because that’s how you can get the kind of advice you need to lead a company through hard timesq what are your thoughts about company culturea you have to make sure you never confuse the hierarchy that you need for managing complexity with the respect that people deserve because that’s where a lot of organizations go off track confusing respect and hierarchy and thinking that low on hierarchy means low respect high on the hierarchy means high respect so hierarchy is a necessary evil of managing complexity but it in no way has anything to do with respect that is owed an individualif you say that to everyone over and over and over it allows people in the company to send me an email no matter what their title might be or to come up to me at any time and point out something — a great idea or a great problem or to seek advice or whateverq other thoughts on culturea the way we define culture over all is how companies get things done if you have a factory you get a lot of things done through machinery most companies in software get things done through people so our machinery is people and to put it in technology terms people are the hardware and our values are the operating system photo mark b templeton is president and ceo of citrix the internet software company credit earl wilsonthe new york times so the culture starts with people with a common operating system around values and then once you have that you can build processes around how you actually get things done on top of that but clarity around the hardware and the operating system to me is first and foremost so it’s about people and our three values respect integrity humility advertisement continue reading the main story it turns out that when you are that clear around people and values it empowers people and creates an entrepreneurial spirit that gives people space and rope rather than being in a commandandcontrol environmentq can you elaboratea first of all everyone feels that they’re birds of a feather because of common values  we have clarity around where we’re going and then they get to fill in how we’re going to get there — with the right kind of management of course and leadership and the right kind of processes and metrics but it’s very much seen as a giant startup newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address

us anytime i think people generally want to belong to something of greater purpose that’s larger than they are they’re just waiting for it to come along and i think a culture around values is part of that people say “i want to be on that team that club because they believe in something and i actually believe in that so i want to belong to that”so communicate it make it simple and clear and then whenever you observe a violation no matter what it is you shine a light on it and ask everyone to do that if they see a violation and hold everyone accountable to it including your manager and your colleagues what i also point out to people is that everyone participates in this because they are all on a hiring team so you have to understand the values because people will come through the filter with a great résumé and all the skills but have they demonstrated the right cultural characteristicsso we’re very clear about culture and the theory is that as long as we have a common operating system that sits on the hardware then we can have all kinds of ways of getting things doneq how do you hire what are you looking fora it starts with these values and then on top of that the things that i really value start with curiosity because curiosity is a measure of selfmotivation people who are curious will develop themselves they’ll discover things they’ll invent things you look for demonstrations of curiosity because that is where someone has done something on their own time that’s outside the band of what they would normally be doingthe second thing i look for is scars you can call it wisdom you can call it experience or the things that went wrong in your life that’s where i think knowledge turns into wisdom a lot of people will have facts and information i’m looking for wisdom and wisdom ends up being a measure of scars and things that went wrong and what you did about them and how they shaped you as a person and your beliefs because people usually lead around the beliefs they’ve developedand do you know how to motivate people  do you know how to align people who are in different organizations and work in a matrix kind of model do you have a vision  do you have opinions with people who have worked for me and failed the pattern is that they’re trying to guess what i believe and they’re trying to tell me what they think i want to hear i know what my opinions are i want your opinions and i want them to be something that you have some belief in and a reason to believe in them and i want to know whyq what kind of advice do you give business studentsa i’ve given this talk for a lot of years because this is what i’ve learned and observed  there are two strategies for your life and career one is paintbynumbers and the other is connectthedots i think most people remember their aunt who brought them a gift for their birthday or whatever and it was a paintbynumber set or a connectthedots book advertisement continue reading the main story so with the paintbynumber set you know ahead of time what it’s going to look like then by contrast with a connectthedots puzzle you can only guess at what it might look like by the time you finish and what you notice about that process is the further along you get the more clear it becomes it might be a beach ball or a seal in a sea world park or something the speed at which you connect dots gets faster as the picture starts coming into viewyou probably get the parallel this isn’t about what’s right and what’s wrong  this is about getting it right for you parents often want you to paint by numbers they want it so badly because they have a perception that it’s lower risk and that’s the encouragement they’re going to give you they’re going to push you down this road and faculty members will too because they want you to deliver on what they taught you it doesn’t make it wrong it’s just that there’s a bias in the system you have to decide for yourself the earlier you actually get it right for yourself the faster and the better that picture is going to lookand the more time you spend on paint by numbers when you’re a connectthedots person and vice versa the harder it’s going to be continue

objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
