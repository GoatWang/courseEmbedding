rating drivers consistent credit quality the collateral backing  is consistent with that of  with a weighted average wa fico score of  and an internal wa loss forecast score lfs of  the wa seasoning is approximately two months new vehicles total  and the pool is geographically diverse increased extendedterm contracts loans with terms of  months total  with  month term loans totalling  in  fitch applied a stress to the loss proxy to account for the risk posed by these loans since performance history is limited and the expectation is that they will perform worse than loans with terms less than

the prior sdart transaction while excess spread totals  stable portfoliosecuritization performance although within range of the  performance recent    losses are tracking slightly higher to date

evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization performance fitch deems scusa capable to service this series legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of scusa would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case this in turn could result in fitch taking negative rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to santander drive auto receivables trust  to increased credit losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses this shows a potential downgrade of one or two categories under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario especially for the subordinate bonds the notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating categories potentially leading to distressed ratings below bsf or possibly default under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario due diligence usage fitch was provided with thirdparty due diligence information from deloitte  touche llp the thirdparty due diligence focused on comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to  loans from the statistical data file fitch
