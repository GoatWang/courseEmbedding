schorsch lost his mojo how nick schorsch lost his mojo the reit king made hundreds of millions in real estate but an accounting scandal devastated his business by bruce kelly — september   todays publication of our story on nicholas schorsch offers readers a rare glimpse into the rise — and fall — of a man who in less than a decade built a multibilliondollar empire on the back of a littleunderstood and often overlooked investment vehicle known as a nontraded real estate investment trust along the way he got rich — fabulously rich many of the people around him the business partners and the firms and brokers who sold his reits also profited so too did many of the investors who poured money into his reits indeed making sure investors in his reits were rewarded was something of a mantra for mr schorsch “investors should get paid first” he said in an april   story in investmentnews “if we make investors money well all make money we have to align the interests of reit sponsors and their investors” at investmentnews we began asking questions about the sustainability of mr schorschs business model long before its cracks began to reveal themselves how long could he continue to raise huge amounts of capital would his formula for cycling investments falter if real estate prices tumbled and interest rates rose in that  article we wrote “with his current success in raising capital the question is whether he will crash and burn as other formerly hot managers in the industry” turns out he did crash and burn in embarking on this story it was never our intent to depict mr schorsch as a villain or a saint no one is one or the other instead we set out to chronicle the factors that led to mr schorschs rise and fall and hopefully to draw a universal lesson or two for readers about his journey to do that investmentnews senior columnist bruce kelly spent hundreds of hours sifting through court documents regulatory filings and newspaper clippings he also spoke to dozens of people who had dealings with mr schorsch including former employees business partners brokers and industry analysts there are many lessons to be drawn from this story lessons about money power and ambition i invite readers regulators and elected officials to decide for themselves what lessons may be learned from mr schorschs storyeditors note it was late october  and nicholas schorsch was riding high after a bruising campaign to acquire cole real estate investments he had won his prize  the acquisition of cole capped one of the most aggressive and feverish buying binges in retail real estate history in just two years one of the firms he headed american realty capital properties inc had made at least five major acquisitions costing  billion in total�cole which mr schorsch had pursued relentlessly for  months would cost the company another  billionbut to mr schorsch the price was worth it cole real estate investments inc was a large wellrespected real estate investment trust and management company and the combination of the two firms would turn arcp into a “juggernaut” that would be unrivaled among its peers he told investors on a conference call the morning the deal was announced“you could argue its the red sox merging with the yankees” he gushedarcp would now have a portfolio worth  billion up from just  million two years earlier in the same conference call mr schorsch bragged that arcp belonged in the sp  an index of the largest and most influential companies in the usan empire builder along the way the then yearold mr schorsch an entrepreneur who had never finished college had become a billionaire according to forbes magazine arcp was only one of dozens of companies in a real estate empire that he had put together in less than a decade it was an empire from which mr schorsch and his associates reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in fees –— compensation that would later be questioned by critics although he appeared to be a workaholic he also enjoyed the trappings of wealth living on manhattans upper east side and in mansions in virginia and newport ri where he collected vintage race cars basking in the glow after the purchase of cole that october day mr schorsch indicated it might finally be time to step back from arcps breakneck acquisition spree“this is the time for us to take a break” he said�what mr schorsch didnt realize that day was that just a year later his flagship reit would be rocked by a scandal that would all but gut the empire that he had worked so hard to build he would resign as chairman from arcp the giant reit he had created and from the boards of many of his other companies two of those firms are facing investigations from regulatory agencies and one is facing a criminal investigationhow did it all fall apart so quicklycritics say mr schorsch was more interested in making deals than being a manager the sheer volume of mergers stock market listings and other transactions he completed —� plus the lackluster performance of his publicly traded companies later on� — bears that out others say he was just interested in getting rich the amount of money he managed to collect from all of his transactions in such a short period of time bears that out as well�the bomb drops on oct   arcp dropped a bombshell on wall street when it revealed a  million accounting misstatement that had resulted in the company reporting inflated financial results whats more the company charged in a filing with the securities and exchange commission that the chief financial officer brian block and the chief accounting officer lisa mcalister were responsible for the misstatements and an ensuing coverup and that as a result they had resigned from the companythe most immediate impact of the stunning revelation was on arcp and another publicly traded company mr schorsch controlled rcs capital corp the stock of both companies plummeted and billions of dollars in market capitalization were lost but the reverberations spread throughout his empire and continue to be felt to this dayarcp now vereit takes a tumble source yahoo finance mr schorsch initially tried to minimize the accounting scandal and move on “the headline is mistakes were made identified and the people involved were identified” he said in a conference call with brokers “it will be fully corrected”but moving on would be difficult especially when one of the senior executives the company blamed for the accounting debacle ms mcalister sued the company for defamation two months later she claimed she had been made a scapegoat in the scandal she also implicated other senior executives in her lawsuit including arcps chairman mr schorsch who she alleged told mr block to conceal intentional accounting misstatements four days before ms mcalisters lawsuit was announced mr schorsch chief executive officer david kay and chief operating officer lisa beeson resigned from arcp�ms mcalister withdrew her lawsuit several weeks later although she maintained the right to sue the company at a later date meanwhile arcp is facing investigations and inquiries from the fbi the securities and exchange commission and the countrys most feared state securities regulator william galvin the secretary of the commonwealth of massachusetts�rcs capital also is being investigated by mr galvins office as well as by the financial industry regulatory authority inc the brokerage industrys selfregulator rcap stock plummets source yahoo finance the most damning criticism of mr schorschs empire to date however comes not from law enforcement or any regulator but in a civil suit brought by investors led by tiaacref the teacher retirement services provider the page suit claims that arcps accounting misstatement was part of a multiyear fraud perpetrated by the company to inflate financial results so it could raise capital to fuel the companys aggressive expansion that expansion in turn generated more than  million in fees for mr schorsch and other insiders according to the complaint“this is not the oneoff story of a rogue employee or two however senior involving a narrow scheme to defraud” according to the court filing “it is the story of a systematically corrupt corporate culture starting at the very top”mr schorsch declined to be interviewed for this story�as a result of the accounting scandal and ensuing legal troubles mr schorschs companies were seriously wounded in the highly regulated securities business many brokerdealers no longer wanted to sell his reits for fear they might become targets of government and industry regulators as well as plaintiffs attorneys representing disgruntled investors business dried up and losses mounted�last month mr schorsch sold a majority interest in another of his flagship companies the privately held ar capital formerly known as american realty capital to privateequity firm apollo global management inc apollo also bought part of rcs capitalmr schorsch has denied all allegations of wrongdoing against him made in the tiaacref and mcalister complaints according to an aug  motion to dismiss filed in us district court for new yorks southern district in manhattan�family connections mr schorsch was born in  into an entrepreneurial family his grandfather was a noted real estate investor in the philadelphia area who also raised and raced horses and his father ran a scrap metals companythe young nick schorsch in some ways had an idyllic life according to the longdefunct philadelphia bulletin newspaper his suburban philadelphia home resembled a farm complete with  lambs three goats and a donkey the chicken coop held five chickens and two peacocks� such a lifestyle stood in contrast to how mr schorschs father made a living through much of the s and early s his father irvin schorsch jr had runins with federal agencies in connection with his company metal bank of america�“the family was well known in the philadelphia area” said joseph distefano a longtime business columnist for the philadelphia inquirer who has followed the schorsch family for decades “the family was for many years in a tough business scrap metal and they also owned metal processing plants they tangled with federal regulators for years”�both the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency investigated metal bank and the epa sued the company over charges of pollution the metal bank site was added to the federal list of superfund cleanup sites in �twentythree years later after the company had been sold a federal court judge in philadelphia approved an  million settlement of which irvin schorsch jr agreed to pay  million“it was interesting to see nick move beyond that into the real estate investing world in the late s and s and to see him reemerge after the financial crisis to control significant assets in various markets” mr distefano said mr schorsch also had political connections edward rendell the former governor of pennsylvania served on the board of arcp from  to this past april “these guys are riverboat gamblers – with the best research due diligence standards and practices available” mr rendell told mr distefano referring to mr schorsch and his colleagues in a  article for the inquirer�mr schorschs drive and ambition are his dominant characteristics said mr distefano and he builds loyalty with the promise of a big payday “it was very clear nick demanded a lot of himself and people” he said “he runs full tilt and people believe in nick and what he is doing they believe that if they sacrifice upfront they will ultimately reap greater rewards in the end”apart from his business responsibilities mr schorsch serves on the board of trustees at the gateway middle school and is a past board member of the hewitt school both in new york he is a member of the advisory board and former honorary chairman of the charitable organization hearts of gold which fosters sustainable change and selfsufficiency among homeless mothers and their children �early career mr schorsch attended drexel university in philadelphia but never finished opting instead to follow his father into the metals business which was sold in  for about  million�mr schorschs wife shelley acted as a business partner in some of his early ventures “his wife told me he didnt need to go back into business” at that point mr distefano said� what do you think taking his cue from his grandfather mr schorsch began to think about investing in real estate�four years after selling the metals business mr schorsch heard about a bank merger between first union corp and corestates financial corp because they shared some of the same market about  overlapping branches in the philadelphia region were scheduled to be closedmr schorsch offered to buy the excess branches en masse for  million his plan was to lease the branches out to other banks he raised the equity for that deal by passing the hat around to friends and family according to a former executive who worked with him at the time it was an idea with potential large returns two months later at a dinner for the investment partners the investors found on each of their seats an envelope with a check for  of their principal according to the executive who asked not to be identified dividends would follow mr schorsch had hit a home run leasing the branches to other banks looking to expand was far stronger than anticipated� enter wall street legend lewis ranieri one of the inventors of the mortgagebacked security and a prominent figure in michael lewis semiautobiographical book about his experiences as a bond salesman during the s“liars poker”  ww norton  co in the early s while mr schorsch was busy buying bank branches mr ranieri separately was thinking of doing something similar when mr ranieris representative called first union and then bank of america he was rebuffed “the banks respond it sounds interesting but we already sell all our real estate to a guy in philly” according to the former executive�mr schorsch teamed up with mr ranieri who had access to wall streets capital markets because of his history as a rainmaker with salomon brothers in the s the duo eventually launched a publicly traded reit american financial realty trust raising  million in an initial public offering in june  a year after the ipo the reit made two large transactions at its peak it had a  billion portfolio including close to  bank branches and office buildings“nick was a master builder” the former executive said “he would take a tiny thing that people didnt think was significant — like a relationship with a banker and turn it into something that would build support and grow american financial realty trust”size matters after some initial success american financial realty trust wound up facing problems particularly due to its rapid expansion according to the former executive while  of the bank branch real estate the reit owned was occupied primarily by banks the rest was vacant according to the former executive who worked at the reit filling those vacancies with tenants proved to be difficult and over time it became more difficult to locate deals because banks were expanding into new territories building up the reit was important to mr schorsch the former executive said “it was very much my experience … that nick believed in the too big to fail theory” he said “bulk and size of assets owned and leased was not a cureall but an important objective to be achieved”�with american financial realty trust shares down and some board members reportedly concerned that mr schorsch was more interested with acquisitions than operations he and the board agreed that he would resign according to a  article in the philadelphia inquirer he received a  million severance according to an sec filing�“his thesis ran its course” the former executive said “the interesting thing or lesson he learned was that capital markets are almost bottomless if he could figure a way to get to them he didnt need a lew ranieri the second time around”mr ranieri praised mr schorsch “his efforts were instrumental in getting banks� and other financial institutions to recognize and appreciate the value american financial realty trust could bring to their business” he told the inquirershareholders did not fare as well as mr schorsch financially�during its ipo in  american financial realty trust stock was sold at  per share it closed at  the day he resigned when the company was sold to another reit in  shareholders received cash and stock worth  a share if investors had held onto those shares since the ipo they would have seen losses of �next stop new york in  mr schorsch and william kahane a former trustee at american financial realty trust launched american realty capital a private real estate management company in new york arc developed or sponsored nontraded reits which at the time was a financial services backwaterthe idea of a nontraded reit is to raise a pool of money from investors quickly buy a portfolio of properties and create an income stream for investors from the rents of the tenants who lease them unlike an investment in publicly traded reits which can be liquidated because investors can sell immediately on the stock exchange where the company is listed the shares of nontraded reits generally have to be held for five to seven years until the reit is sold or listed on an exchange at that time investors can cash out the amount they receive for their shares generally depends on the appreciation — or depreciation — of the underlying real estate over the time period the nontraded reit existedadvisers working for independent brokerdealers sell nontraded reits to individual investors as a way to diversify their stockandbond portfolios for the advisers and brokerdealers it doesnt hurt that the sales earn sizable commissions — often  to the adviser and another  to  to the brokerdealer additional commissions and fees from the sponsor and its affiliates can drive up the cost of nontraded reits to  or more the first year and thats why some advisers refuse to sell them they believe the steep fees and commissions make it difficult for the investor to earn the return of his or her principal�good timing mr schorsch was ramping up his nontradedreit business at an opportune time after the financial crisis retail investors were looking for safe alternatives to stocks that would pay them more than the  or  they could earn in treasuries with annual dividends of around  to  nontraded reits promised attractive returns besides their high commissions a significant downside for some investors was that they had to commit their money for a multiyear period mr schorsch realized that the illiquid nature of reits was a drawback for many investors he sought an advantage over competitors by cutting the time investors money was tied up by trying to sell his reits or list them on stock exchanges to two three or four years rather than five to seven�the strategy was not only good for investors it was good for mr schorsch and the advisers who sold his reits after cashing out their investment many investors reinvested in another of mr schorschs nontraded reits generating yet more commissions for the advisers and more fees for arc“nick realized he could raise unlimited amounts of money from retail investors and their money was sticky” said frank chandler a former arc executive who for a time would serve as president of realty capital securities the wholesaling division of rcs capital “the key was returning capital he knew it from the beginning he also knew that if he returned  the investor would then send the broker  or ”�to help market his nontraded reits mr schorsch kept them simple they focused on freestanding properties that were occupied by nationally known retailers such as lowes walgreens cvs and dollar general the properties were rented on a net lease basis meaning tenants were responsible for maintenance taxes and other charges the rents that were paid were distributed to shareholders after management fees were deducted�mr schorsch took the nontraded reit industry as well as the independentbrokerdealer community by storm while other nontradedreit sponsors have started quickly none have matched the speed of arc according to industry executivesaggressive moves arc was much more aggressive than other firms in trying to get advisers to sell its products said john rooney managing principal of commonwealth financial network an independent brokerdealer what do you think “the number of calls they made to the firm was unusual” he said “they were very tenacious”while the competition was marketing one or two deals at a time mr schorsch was handling several “it was clear that he had substantial goals” mr chandler said “billions not millions came out of his mouth from the beginning”what he lacked in experience mr schorsch made up for in ambition personal drive and persistence“in  and  he began pitching to brokerdealers but nobody knew nick” mr chandler said “he was far more aggressive than the average person he would call a firm and then follow up in three days while the competition took three months he would get on a plane to see a guy” and mr schorsch and his executive team were also demanding with employees and others representing arc mr chandler said during meetings he said they also would scream at senior lawyers and accountants at major firms over the telephone“that part was the posturing and setting the tone” at arc mr chandler said “every day was an emergency at arc until you realized it wasnt thats the way business was done”“i saw nothing illegal or immoral but the people at arc were aggressive much more than i had seen before in my life” mr chandler saidarcs early deals paid off handsomely for investors with returns of   and  on principal plus dividendscommonwealth was one of a few large brokerdealers that would not let its advisers sell mr schorschs reitspoints of concern “a sponsor raising tons of dollars with dozens of products and flipping or merging the products quickly are points of concern” mr rooney said�arcps accounting scandal he said “would appear to confirm suspicions of a company moving fast and willing to cut corners”but mr schorsch also had supporters“ive admired everything theyve done but they may have done it too fast” said richard bryant president and part owner of capital investment group inc an independent brokerdealer that sold mr schorschs reits�“what they did particularly arcs and nicks stellar growth of the reits was unprecedented” mr bryant said arc and mr schorsch “made my clients hundreds of thousands of dollars”�“arc has been very aggressive but on the back end they took reits full cycle” said dan wildermuth chief executive and founder of kalos capital management a brokerdealer that focuses on alternative investment strategies including reits he noted that other nontraded reit managers and sponsors had older reits in which investors were stuck those reits whose portfolios declined in value after the financial crisis were unable to come up with a liquidation strategythose nontraded reit players — there were only a handful in the industry — did not exactly welcome mr schorsch into their clubby world from the moment he got to new york mr schorsch began talking publicly about changes he wanted to bring to the industry including more transparency and the need for companies to better align their interests with those of their shareholdersperhaps nothing illustrated the conflict between mr schorsch and the established industry than his dogged pursuit of cole real estate investments cole initially rejected arcps offer to buy the company out of hand and complained in an open letter to the industry that arcp was interfering with its businessundaunted mr schorsch made four more bids for cole eventually increasing his initial offer  from  per share to  per share driving up the price to  billion including debt according to a company proxymr schorsch had a big impact on the industry nontraded reit sales were  billion in  according to investment bank robert a stanger  co inc by  they had increased to  billion and a substantial amount of that gain was directly attributable to mr schorsch and his companies�from  through may arc and related companies had raised  billion exactly onefourth of the total amount of equity raised  billion by the entire industry in that period�birth of an empire between  and  mr schorsch created an intricate web of companies many of them with similar sounding names in its suit tiaacref identified  companies that mr schorsch either owned or controlled many of them doing business with each other�such arrangements proved highly lucrative for mr schorsch and his partners according to the complaint in fact the source of most of his income was not the salary or bonuses he earned from his management positions at these companies but the fees and stock awards the entities he controlled received from the hundreds of transactions the companies were involved in during this time� according to tiaacrefs lawsuit mr schorsch headed a company called arc properties advisors that was the external manager responsible for arcps affairs on a daytoday basis that firm and its affiliates received more than  million in  and  for expenses related to arcp acquisitions the complaint states in addition arc properties advisors collected another  million in  and  for “subordinated distribution fees” and “strategic advisory services” in connection with arcps acquisition of two reits that had been started by arc according to the lawsuit and an additional  million for “general and administrative expenses” and  million for “management fees”in one instance the lawsuit charges that arc properties advisors received a  million fee from arcp for furniture fixtures and equipment in sec filings arcp later acknowledged that it could not confirm the value of those items because it could not even verify that it had ever received thembuyer and seller mr schorschs empire was so interconnected that his companies were sometimes able to collect fees from both the buyer and seller in the same transaction according to the tiaacref complaint in one case when mr schorsch was still ceo of arcp it purchased a reit called arc iv which was also controlled by mr schorsch yet another schorsch firm acted as an adviser to both arcp and arc iv in the transaction and collected a  million fee from each of the firms or a total of  million according to the tiaacref suitin all the tiaacref suit alleges that arc properties advisors and its affiliates received more than  million from arcp in just three years most of which consisted of fees commissions services and acquisitionrelated expensesmr schorsch in his motion to dismiss the suit claimed that the math in the complaint is faulty while the assertion that nearly  billion was funneled to entities controlled by mr schorsch is the “linchpin” of the complaint he said tiaacref “fails to explain how that  million figure was calculated” apart from the size of the fees such deals raise questions about conflicts of interest especially when mr schorsch and his associates served as executives or board members on so many different companies in the schorsch empire that conducted business with one anotherfor example a close confidant from mr schorschs days in philadelphia at his first reit michael weil served as arcps president treasurer and secretary from its startup until january  he also served as president chief operating officer and director of arc iv and another ar capital reit arc iii which was also acquired by arcp mr weil and mr schorsch who also had management positions at both firms abstained from the actual votes to approve those acquisitions but one observer questioned whether there was at the very least an appearance of a conflict of interest“its the same management team buying assets from each other” said brad thomas editor of forbes real estate investor a publication that focuses on reits “how do you serve two masters”anatomy of a deal investmentnews asked a forensic accountant gordon yale to look at one of the deals the sale of arc iii arcp paid  billion for arc iii in  representing a premium of  over the gross equity invested in the reit however mr yale noted that  of the arc iii real estate portfolio had been purchased within the previous year how could the properties have appreciated that much in a year or less to justify such a high price what do you think although  was a good year for commercial real estate returns on benchmark indexes were in the  to  range significantly lower than the premium arcp paid for arc iii�“given that approximately  billion of the  billion arc iii real estate portfolio had been purchased in  the  premium paid to arc iii shareholders was simply massive” mr yale saidbut arc iii shareholders were not the only ones who enjoyed a windfall from the sale according to a filing with the sec mr schorsch and his partners received  million in compensation when the deal closed in early �the payday from the sale of another reit american realty capital healthcare trust was even bigger when the arcsponsored reit was sold to ventas inc a giant health care reit not controlled by mr schorsch he received one share of ventas stock for each operating partnership unit he controlled that worked out to  million�“why is nick being paid so much for this” asked forbes mr thomas “nick made a lot of money those numbers are mindboggling”the central argument made in the tiaacref suit is that mr schorsch and his lieutenants were more interested in collecting high fees and payouts from acquisitions at arcp than working legitimately to improve the performance of arcp on behalf of its shareholders in fact the complaint charges that the entire purpose of arcps aggressive acquisition spree was to generate fees for mr schorsch and his associatesshortly after its initial public offering in september  arcps shares fell below the ipo price of  as the company reported only modest growth in a key metric used to measure reit performance — adjusted funds from operations or affo arcps antidote was to manipulate its books through a series of improper accounting tricks to artificially inflate affo and hopefully its stock price according to the lawsuit the stock price did begin to rise after sinking to a low of  a share in june  arcps stock began climbing almost a year later it peaked at  the reason was clear the lawsuit maintains the company had begun reporting higher and higher affo figures –— though they later turned out to be inflated the suit chargesgiven the improved stock price arcp began building a war chest selling  billion in corporate debt and  million shares of arcp stock that allowed arcp to make no less than five billiondollar acquisitions including the deal for cole and to generate the generous fees for mr schorsch and his associates the suit maintainsbut mr schorsch asserts in court filings that arcps growth was “not indicative of fraud” in his response to the suit he said tiaacref and the other plaintiffs “certainly do not claim that these acquisitions were harmful to shareholders — nor can they as the acquisitions were wellreceived by the market”the empire crumbles the good times at arcp — and eventually the rest of the schorsch empire — started to come crashing down when the accounting misstatements were disclosed last october arcp acknowledged that the affo number had been inflated by  million in the first quarter of  and  million in the second quarter the inflated affo figures had caused the company to understate its loss in the second quarter alone by  million even more startling was arcps admission in an sec filing that two of its senior executives knew about the misstatements but intentionally left them uncorrectedthe stock market pounced arcps shares dropped from  on the day before the announcement to  almost a week later a  decline that erased over  billion in market capitalization in roughly the same period shares at another major company controlled by mr schorsch rcs capital corp dropped  wiping out hundreds of millions of investor equity�five months later in an sec filing arcp acknowledged that the company had been overstating affo all the way back to  and that certain payments to schorschrelated entities “were not sufficiently documented”companies interrelated mr schorsch and his lieutenants tried to separate the scandal at arcp from rcs capital and his other holdings but it didnt work mr schorschs empire had so many interrelated companies and personnel serving in multiple roles at those companies that when one part of the company encountered difficulty so did everything else�rcs capital or rcap for example comprises realty capital securities the reit wholesaler that marketed primarily nontraded reits to advisers at independent brokerdealers and a network of  advisers cetera financial group that mr schorsch had acquired over the previous year or so because of the association with arcp sales at the wholesaling division plunged the brokerage business is highly regulated and brokerdealers were afraid of attracting attention from the sec and finra “it was difficult from the outside looking in to determine precisely how much overlap in practice there was between the various schorsch entities” said mr rooney of commonwealth financialrealty capital securities was recently sold to apollo global management for  million and rcaps ceo michael weil — the same mr weil who had formerly worked at arcp and mr schorschs first reit  years ago in philadelphia — along with the companys cfo are leaving rcap shares have yet to recover in fact following the recent reorganization and a  million quarterly loss the stock dropped even further and shares are now trading at around  a year ago those same shares hovered around  altogether more than  billion of equity has been lopped off the stock since the accounting scandal first broke�arc another major part of the schorsch empire was also damaged arc which depended on the creation and sale of nontraded reits raised cash from investors at about half the rate after the scandal than before according to stanger the investment bank arc also recently signed a deal with apollo the privateequity firm bought a  interest for  million in cash and stock and renamed the company ar global investments an apollo executive told the wall street journal that the purchase would have cost the firm “billions of dollars” prior to the accounting scandalshares of arcp which changed its name to vereit at the end of july have not recovered either and are trading in the  range despite the hiring of a new ceo glenn rufrano who is highly regarded since the beginning of  vereit has released restated financials established new leadership added independent directors to its board and improved the companys internal infrastructure including the adoption of new corporate governance initiatives a company spokesman said in a statement members of the arcp management team that left the company during the fourth quarter of  are no longer affiliated with vereitthe company which was highly leveraged from its acquisition spree recently announced it is selling off about  billion worth of properties and is trying to reduce its debt so far it has disposed of  million worth of properties toward that goal vereits spokesman said mr schorsch faces an uncertain future forbes which at one point estimated that he was worth  billion recently revised that figure to  million while he is expected to work for ar global under new management some of the firms he once headed are facing investigations and lawsuits stemming from the accounting scandaluncertain future he may also be facing a legal battle with vereit according to its most recent quarterly report mr schorsch and his affiliates are seeking  million related to the period when they served as arcps external manager prior to january  in an sec filing vereit has indicated that it will challenge that requestone industry veteran pointed to past nontraded reit managers who had boom andbust cycles as a way of understanding the impact of mr schorsch on the securities industry� “nick is the latest in a line of nontraded reit sponsors who raised a boatload of money did an adequate job for investors and then paid himself” said mr rooney of commonwealth “certainly the reits that went full cycle did well for advisers and clients in an adverse interest rate environment”�“what separates nick from his predecessors is the rapidity of the composition of his empire and the haste of which it all went bad” he said “that usually plays out over a decade with nick it unwound as fast as it sprang up” please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus subscribe to print newsletter signup register now in print this weeks issue to download the full

albert alfonsoalbert alfonso dividend investing dividend growth investing master limited partnerships oil  gassummaryrcs capital and new york reit say goodbye to nick schorschfurthermore nick schorsch has stepped down from the board of  nontraded reits and direct investment programs sponsored by ar capitalthese events follow his recent surprise resignation from arcp and the worrying allegations brought forward in a lawsuitwhat a whirlwind of news surrounding nick schorsch and his various nontraded reit entities according to various reports mr schorsch has stepped down as director and executive chairman of the board of rcs capital corporation nysercap in addition mr schorsch has stepped down from his position as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of new york reit inc nysenyrt if this were all not enough mr schorsch also announced that he was stepping down from the board of  nontraded reits sponsored by ar capital a company which he cofounded as part of these initiatives and in order to reduce complexity ar capital cofounder nicholas s schorsch has notified the boards of directors of rcs capital corporation rcs capital new york reit inc nyrt and  nontraded reits and direct investment programs sponsored by ar capital of his decision to step down from his board positions at these companies effective immediately mr schorsch has made this decision in order to focus his attention on strategic initiatives and potential liquidity events of closed programs sponsored by ar capital and new strategies for the future suite of ar capital investment programs these actions should greatly minimize distractions and immediately eliminate any perceived or potential conflicts created as a result of mr schorschs involvement on the boards of ar capitalsponsored programs or on the board of rcs capital whose subsidiary realty capital securities is the wholesale broker dealer that distributes those programs these are all quite stunning developments however if one were reading the tea leaves signs of trouble for mr schorsch were everywhere soon after the accounting errors at arcp were disclosed sales of schorschlinked nontraded reits those sponsored by cole capital and ar capital pretty much collapsed numerous registered reps and investment advisers stopped selling the products indeed things have gotten so bad that rcs capital walked away from an agreement to purchase cole capital from arcp requiring rcs capital to reach settlement for m according to investmentnews sales of american realty capital nontraded reits plunged  in november compared with october and sales of cole capital nontraded reits dropped  month over month only two weeks ago mr schorsch resigned as executive chairman of american realty capital properties arcp however arcp made it pretty clear that this resignation was not fully voluntary noting that in connection with mr schorschs departure as executive chairman arcp will be unwinding all of its relationships with entities in which mr schorsch maintains an executive or directorlevel role or is a significant stockholder these steps will not only enhance the companys corporate governance structure but will also lead to further simplification of its business relationships so basically arcp forced mr schorsch out and cut all ties in addition bloomberg estimated that he was walking away from a compensation package of worth about  million while this point is somewhat speculative this resignation and those of other senior arcp executives may have been influenced by the lawsuit filed by lisa p mcalister former chief accounting officer of arcp in which it was alleged that mr schorsch had ordered subordinates to manipulate financial results at the company you can read more about this in my earlier article the wsj article and the related pdf of the full complaint conclusion mr schorschs nontraded reit empire is pretty much in ruins while rcs capital ar capital and cole capital will try to pick up the pieces and move on the damage done is likely permanent furthermore investors are wising up to the risks and high fees associated with nontraded reits which were often portrayed as as alternatives to bonds and other fixedincome investmentsthere is now a severe stigma associated with these products which will not be helped given the disgraceful downfall of the biggest name in the
