propertycasualty marketplace the once distinct line between standard and specialty business has blurred to the point where some even question its existence with standard carriers moving aggressively beyond their usual bounds excesssurplus and specialty lines insurers are facing intense competition on both pricing and capacity what the seasoned veterans of specialty business understand better than anyone else is probably their saving grace that over time competition comes and goes but theres nothing more important to longterm success than maintaining a stable presence in the specialty

underwriting expertise in a number of markets excess casualty property primary general liability professional liability and programs the group also writes a small amount of highvalue homeowners business currently fsmg is focusing on two areas it believes offer significant growth and profit opportunities property and professional liability professional liability is an area weve been highlighting in our strategic planning and growth objectives for the next three to five years palmieri explains our involvement in the errors and omissions market dates back to the 9s we wrote the first eo policy for the mutual fund industry we still have policies in force that go back several decades chris maciejewski who is responsible for field operations emphasizes first states flexibility in accommodating regional differences fsmg is organized into divisions by type of specialty underwriters for all of our major product lines are located in our regional offices palmieri explains they have substantial underwriting authority and they also interface with our home office people lets look at the products and coverages each division offers then explore in more detail how first state

available focus on financial services some  of first states total professional liability premium volume is derived from financial services business heading up the professional liability division through which these coverages are written is first vice president edward neuberger in financial services he emphasizes stability and longevity are major determinants of first states successcoupled with creative underwriting and a thorough understanding of the industry many of our customers in financial servicesmutual funds institutional investment advisershave been with us for many years because of the pioneering efforts of our predecessors neuberger explains we stay current with trends in the industry and we make sure our policies are consistent with the needs of our insureds an area in which first state has a long history of underwriting competence he says is fiduciary liability fiduciary liability was greatly affected in the 9s with the passage of erisa employee retirement income security act which essentially codified that coverage first state was a pioneer in developing policies to comply with the requirements of the law as was mentioned earlier first state has targeted its professional liability business as a major growth area in the years ahead in our  strategic planning we assessed our position in professional liability palmieri says we had a sound but somewhat static platform from which to grow this business at that point we brought in ed neuberger he has extensive knowledge of the business plus producer contacts nationwide many people know him and they came to first state when he joined us hes been busy putting together an impressive team of underwriters and were placing some of them in our branch offices so theyll be closer to our markets neuberger clearly is having a substantial impact on first states professional liability operation our professional liability operation is a strong growth engine for us and weve experienced significant premium growth every year since  in fact if we meet our projections by the end of 9 well have achieved growth of 0 since  palmieri says the market for professional liability is extremely competitive but were growing through additional product offerings as well as additional penetration of regional markets moving into epli when i came to first state there was a solid base of financial services and erisa products neuberger explains since then weve brought on several major new products one of which is employment practices liability insurance or epli we decided early that we wanted to be a responsive player in the market for employers with  to  employees we crafted products with broad definitions of employment practices and who is covered weve continued to fine tune this product its being modified and amended in the marketplace in this process first state goes right to the source its customers we work with customer groups to identify coverage enhancements and meaningful services we can offer with the product neuberger says its in the area of services that we have the best opportunity to differentiate ourselves for instance our tollfree help line and our cdrombased employer handbook are valuable tools to help our clients manage their exposures an attractive new market that neubergers group is currently cultivating is epli for real estate agents real estate agents are typically independent contractors and their coverage requirements are different from those of the ordinary employeremployee relationship neuberger explains were also becoming a player in the market for real estate agents eo he says we met with a producer and several real estate firms to analyze their existing coverages and determine how we could enhance them weve tried to make deductibles more affordable for individual agents and we now offer a range of deductibles weve also analyzed and revamped our lock box liability coverage to make it more responsive to our insureds needs in developing coverage grants for its wide variety of professional liability policies neuberger adds we generally try to use language thats familiar to the particular industry popular products a product that is very popular today according to neuberger is miscellaneous eo this works very well as part of a package and it can be applied to many different industries he notes we have broadbased capabilities here its an area where our underwriters can get excited and be really creative also enjoying rapid growth ralph palmieri says is first states lawyers professional liability program which under the direction of senior vice president for field operations chris maciejewski is expanding from the new england states to other parts of the country with respect to professional liability in general were keenly aware that our insureds reputation is at stake palmieri says in professional liability our guiding principle is if youre a professional your reputation is sacrosanct and well do everything in our power to protect you for this reason we focus strongly on loss control and claims handling we really feel that our claims service quality is such that if every one of our insureds had a claim our retention rate would be  in designing coverages and services for this market he emphasizes we take a valueadded approach in conjunction with the rhode island bar association we offer seminars that allow attorneys to qualify for continuing education credit this year we purchased a loss control brochure on yk exposures and distributed it to all of our clients we also assist our broker in publishing a loss control newsletter media liability another hot product in specialty markets these days is media liability were just starting to unveil our media liability facility neuberger says weve joined with partners in kansas city to roll out stateoftheart media liability coverages for newspapers book and magazine publishers and radio and television stations this area is really heating up in the marketplace as with professional liability in general he observes protecting the customers reputation is the utmost priority so topquality loss prevention and claims service are essential adds palmieri in media liability theres a smaller community of knowledgeable underwriters than in many other lines we dont expect it to be as widespread as epli media liability is an area where defense lawyers really have to know their business in terms of first amendment and constitutional law an important role first state plays as part of the hartford conglomerate palmieri explains is partnering with hartfords standard commercial lines underwriters to fill gaps in their insureds professional liability coverages we deal with knowledgeable experienced wholesalers and they in turn share their expertise with the retail independent agent who may need an epli or miscellaneous liability policy only occasionally a competitive edge its no secret that todays specialty lines marketplace is intensely competitive with standard carriers delving into areas they never would have considered entering just a few years ago today theres an abundance of capacity or even an overabundance palmieri comments we encounter competition from both admitted and surplus lines carriers and the lines continue to be blurred with the advent of commercial deregulation one of our strengths is that we offer both admitted and nonadmitted facilitiesand we provide a degree of regional presence and flexibility that isnt available from every carrier throughout first state field operations executive chris maciejewski says were very flexible in accommodating regional differences for example insureds in some regions want property and casualty products to be packaged whereas in other areas theres a demand for professional liability and epli coverages to be packaged with other coverages so in each case we do our best to meet our insureds needs adds palmieri we have a strong customer focus and we concentrate on adding value in our products as well as our underwriting loss control and claims service and the stability of hartford is a strong factor when prospects are evaluating us against competitors we have more than enough capacity to differentiate ourselves from competitors that may have lesser capacity concerning competition palmieri observes weve heard a fair amount of rhetoric over the last six to nine months with respect to carriers beginning to draw the line on the commercial side we may see evidence of this soonbut in our strategic planning were not counting on any big changes instead were focusing on lines that offer the best profit potential using our strength in underwriting expertise if the market changes for the better that would be a bonus an exercise in reinvention most of us have been together a long time as a management team and this gives us a good perspective on the market and on the opportunities in the market palmieri comments ten or twelve years ago our largest product line was umbrella given the deterioration in pricing umbrella is now a very small part of our operation since  our facility for primary general liability has paid off very handsomely and in  after hurricane andrew we increased our property writings in the catastrophe area because pricing had become very favorable over a long span of time first state has reinvented itself along the way avoiding pitfalls and taking advantage of its strengths if that sounds like a formula for success it is with its valueadded approach underwriting creativity and regional flexibility first state management group is more than ready to meet the challenges of the new millenniumand beyond  copyright the rough notes magazine 9 ralph palmieris phone number email
