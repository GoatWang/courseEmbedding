bunte bros v standard chocolates  f supp  d mass  sign in or register to save a favorite click to dismiss district court d massachusetts filed may th  precedential status precedential citations  f supp  docket number  author francis joseph william ford  f supp   bunte bros v standard chocolates inc no  district court d massachusetts may    nathan heard and frederick a tennant both of boston mass and john a marzall of chicago ill for plaintiff david stoneman and singer stoneman  kurland all of boston mass for defendant ford district judge this is a suit in which the plaintiff relies for relief solely on its claim for technical trademark infringement the plaintiff is an illinois corporation manufacturing and distributing candy with its principal place of business in chicago the defendant also a manufacturer and distributor of candy is a massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in boston on may   the plaintiff registered in the united states patent office the trademark diana no  alleging it had adopted and used this trademark in the sale and distribution of candy since august   this registration was renewed on may   for several years before the date of the complaint and up to the present time the plaintiff has sold hard candy in glass and metal containers throughout the united states including massachusetts a picture of the mythical goddess diana appears on a label on these containers and near the top of the label is the word bunte appearing above the name diana bunte is in script and diana is in block type the confections in the containers are described either above or below the picture as stuft confections in  the defendant began the manufacture and sale and still sells in various states including massachusetts a small flat paper box containing twelve chocolates of good quality upon which appears the name diana deane there are no other marks of similarity on the defendants small box beyond the use of the name diana deane diana deane appears on the defendants letterheads and advertising without the presence of its firm name the firm name standard chocolates inc is also absent from its boxes the evidence adduced by the defendant showed that none of the containers of hard  candy or any other type of candy such as chocolates distributed for many years past by the plaintiff bore the name of diana alone but in all instances as far as representatives of the trade who testified knew the containers bore the names bunte diana appearing in the manner described above or merely bunte the name bunte was also used alone on some sizes of glass containers of hard candy on the other hand the defendant stipulated paragraph  of stipulation that the plaintiff is and has for several years past been selling candy bearing upon the containers the trademark diana the defendant showed through a number of candy retailers and a jobber of confections that the hard or stuft confections of the plaintiff were known in the trade as buntes diana and these witnesses all testified they never heard of a single instance of confusion on the part of a purchaser with respect to the respective products of the plaintiff and the defendant the plaintiff produced no evidence of actual instances of confusion and i find that the defendant made no sales of its chocolates that could be attributed to the use of the infringing mark on these facts the defendant argues  that the plaintiff does not own diana as a common law trademark but in reality its trademark is bunte diana and  that even if it owns diana as common law trademark there is little likelihood of confusion between that mark and diana deane no question was raised by the defendant that the chocolates it sold were merchandise of the same descriptive quality as that set forth in the plaintiffs registration of its trademark the plaintiff alleged in its complaint that it was the owner of the trademark diana for candy and that it had been registered in the patent office on the date stated above and also that it had used this trademark continuously up to the date of the complaint the defendant stipulated that the plaintiff is the grantee of is now and has ever since the grant thereof been the owner of united states trade mark registration no  which registration was duly renewed may   paragraph  of stipulation the defendant did not question the validity of the registration it was quite evident at the trial that the plaintiff did not come into court with any idea that it would have to meet the defense that the plaintiff was not the owner of the trademark diana because as the defendant contended it had never adopted or used any such trademark the case heavily relied upon by the defendant i e armour  co v louisville provision co  cir  f  is not applicable to the facts of this case in the armour case the plaintiff had not registered the word star as a trademark and there was no admission as there was here paragraph  stipulation that armour  co had ever adopted and used star as a trademark further the court found as a fact that armour  co always used star in conjunction with armours and that never at any time had it adopted and used star alone there being no user of star alone in connection with its products armour  co had no trademark in star in the instant case the registration under the  act created a presumption of adoption and use sufficient to make out a prima facie case and the defendant conceded the validity of this registration federal trademark act of  §   usca §  chapinsacks mfg co v hendler creamery co et al  cir  f  nims unfair competition and trademarks rd ed c xvi section  further the defendant stipulated diana was used by the plaintiff on its containers for several years past it may be well in view of the facts here to consider briefly whether there is any evidence of abandonment in the case i do not believe so the burden is on the defendant to prove abandonment and the latter is purely a question of intent hanover star milling co v metcalf  us   s ct   l ed  burt v tucker  mass   ne   lra   am st rep  nims unfair competition and trademarks section  p  it cannot be said that the plaintiff intended to abandon its trademark merely by using its own name in conjunction with it and certainly abandonment cannot be found in view of the admission of user in paragraph  of the stipulation the only question remaining is whether the defendant did within the meaning of the provisions of section  of the  act  usca §  reproduce counterfeit copy or colorably imitate the plaintiffs  trademark diana in the sale of its candies under the circumstances outlined above most of the cases cited by the parties are federal cases there is no need to make any distinction between these and the applicable massachusetts cases they both stand for the same principles the test with regard to this latter issue is whether the words diana deane are so similar to diana that any person with such reasonable care and observation as the public are so generally capable of using and may be expected to exercise would mistake one product for another gilman v hunnewell  mass  mclean v fleming  us   l ed  under the facts here would the purchaser who merely looks or hears as the ordinary purchaser does be misled there was no similarity in the containers used for the different candies by the respective parties there was no similarity of labels the only similarity was in the use of the word diana the court said in saxlehner v eisner  mendelson co  us  at page   s ct    l ed  it is not necessary to constitute an infringement that every word of a trademark should be appropriated it is sufficient that enough be taken to deceive the public in the purchase of a protected article cf ammon  person v narragansett dairy co ltd  cir  f   where the plaintiff had a trademark queen of the west and the defendant infringed by the use of queen and the addition of other words by an infringer may not destroy the identity of a trademark or name and relieve the infringer of the consequences of infringement the court in the case of cocacola co v stevenson et al dc  f   stated the principle in the following language added words and their embellishment do not destroy property rights in a trademark in thomas g plant co v may co  cir  f  quality was added by the plaintiff to queen which was a trademark of the plaintiff it was held here that the plaintiff was entitled to protection against the use of queen by another manufacturer and seller of ladies shoes the addition did not destroy the identity of the trademark in century distilling co v continental distilling co  cir  fd  it was held that dixiana and dixie dew infringed the trademarks dixie belle and dixie beau in nashville syrup co v coca cola co  cir  f   anncasb  coca cola was held infringed by the name fletchers coca cola used on the same product in northam warren corp v universal cosmetic co  cir  fd  cutex was held to be infringed by cuticlean the court said that infringement did not depend on the use of identical words  f d page  a further citation of cases seems unnecessary each case stands on its own facts and the basic question involved in all of them is whether there is likelihood of confusion it is of no moment that there is no direct evidence of confusion or intention to confuse which elements i find missing in the present case the plaintiffs trademark consisted of one word and that word or name was adopted by the defendant as the first word of its tradename first names in trademarks catch the eye and ear they are very likely to be the dominant words where an only word or first word of a trademark is adopted by a competitor as the first word in its trademark there is more likelihood of confusion than when second or later words are used cf cocacola co v carlisle bottling co dc  fd  affirmed  cir  fd  there is no intimation here that if only later words are used or first words are used as later words in a competitors trademark there is not likely to be confusion as stated above each case is bottomed on its own facts and it is my conclusion in this case that the defendants diana deane was likely to be confused by the purchaser with the plaintiffs diana another point the defendant argues in its brief is to the effect that the plaintiff which admittedly used diana on three different kinds of its hard candy used it to denote grade or quality and this fact has deprived it of any right of protection by this court what the defendant means by the words i have quoted from its brief i do not exactly know if it means the plaintiff has no trademark in diana because of this i do not believe this question is open to it the validity of the trademark being admitted by the stipulation however it might be well to go on and say that even if the validity of the trademark were being questioned diana is not the use of a word to designate  or identify a grade or quality of merchandise and consequently is not invalid as a trademark diana is an arbitrary word and used to denote origin and properly registerable if adopted and used the only remaining question in view of the finding of technical trademark infringement is the measure of relief the plaintiff offered no evidence of its own actual damage or of the defendants profits section  of the act of   usca §  the defendant acted in good faith in using diana deane there was no attempt at any time to deceive the public the defendant proved there was no instance of actual confusion in the sale of its chocolates and it made its sales for a reason other than the association of the infringing mark the infringement consequently hardly bore any relation to any profits made by the defendant in other words the infringement had no cash value in sales made by it cf mishawaka rubber  woolen mfg co v s s kresge co may    s ct   led  under the circumstances judgment will be to the effect that a permanent injunction will issue restraining the defendant from using the name diana in the manufacture and sale of its candies  facebook facebook   ？ facebook ？？：？，。english us한국어français francebahasa indonesiapolskiespañolportuguês
