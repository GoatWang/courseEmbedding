fixedrate aasfexp outlook stable  class c fixedrate asfexp outlook stable  class d fixedrate nrexp key rating drivers fitchs expected ratings are based on the underlying receivables pool available credit enhancement synchrony banks underwriting synchrony financials servicing and the transactions legal and cash flow structures which employ early redemption triggers rating sensitivities fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card assetbacked securities transactions  increased defaults  a reduction in purchase rate and  a combination stress of higher defaults and lower monthly payment rate mpr increasing defaults and reducing purchase rate alone have the least impact on rating migration even in the most severe scenario of a  increase in defaults the harshest scenario assumes both stresses in increased chargeoffs and reduction to mpr to occur simultaneously similarly the ratings would only be downgraded under the moderate stress of a  increase in defaults and  reduction in mpr however the severe stress could lead to more drastic downgrades to all classes to date the transactions have exhibited strong performance with all performance metrics within fitchs initial expectations for further discussion of our sensitivity analysis please see the related presale report for a discussion
