control surfaces and engine components facilities of das are located in el mirage ca gardena ca monrovia ca orange ca parsons ks coxsackie ny and guaymas mexico  ducommun technologies dti dti designs engineers and manufactures electromechanical subassemblies and provides engineering technical and program management services principally for the aerospace and military markets a principle role of dti is in manufacturing complex mechanical and electromechanical enclosure products more specifically these products include electromechanical illuminated push button switches advanced microwave switches and highperformance motors and resolvers through its miltec subsidiary dti offers missile and aerospace systems design development integration and testing dti facilities are strategically placed in carson ca newbury park ca phoenix az huntsville al colorado springs co iuka ms and oxford ms  and thailand  industry analysis porters five forces threat of entry low entering the aerospace and defense services industry requires a substantial amount of capital requirements ducommuns main reason for success has been its historical record of over  years for example ducommun occupies approximately  facilities with a total office and manufacturing area of over  square feet including both owned and leased properties  a start up company would require exceptional amount of human and financial capital to even considering opening a single manufacturing facility ducommun also prides itself on its strong brand identity it is very hard for a start up company to build that reputation and gain the respect by its customers suppliers and competitors competitive rivalry high the aerospace and defense industry is highly competitive and the products and services are affected by varying degrees of competition ducommuns direct competitors focus on offering the same services such as manufacturing aerostructure components or electromechanical components on the other hand ducommun has competitors worldwide some of which are much larger with respect to resources available to them they have greater financial technical and personnel advantages than what ducommun operates with these larger competitors also offer a wider variety of products and service this can be a problem for ducommun due to the competitors ability to offer customers bundled products threat of substitutes med products offered by ducommun to the commercial and military markets are also offered by other competitors however ducommun is a proven leader in terms of quality with the products that it sells the company has right to various patents that allow it to maintain its competitive advantage on its products das has some of the largest and most sophisticated stretchforming presses in the united states these patented processes allow das to form the aerostructural components at a higher quality than the available substitutes blue chip customers bargaining power of suppliers low ducommun is not materially dependent upon any individual rawmaterial supplier a majority of the products are obtained on the openmarkets domestically and internationally therefore no supplier offers a unique enough product for ducommun to rely on bargaining power of customers high boeing company ba raytheon and united technologies utx accounted for  of the companies total revenues in  during  sales to boeing were  or approximately  of total sales sales to raytheon were  or approximately  of total sales sales to the united technologies were  or approximately  of total sales the fact that just under half of the overall revenues come from three companies these customers have a large influence on the operations of ducommun competitors lmi aerospace inc lmia lmi aerospace inc is a leading provider of design engineering services structural assemblies kits and components to the aerospace defense and technology markets lmia provides a broad array of manufacturing capabilities as well as engineering and valueadded services to the commercial and military aircraft markets in addition the company also provides prototyping testing and design capabilities to customers in support of new product development lmia was founded in  and is based in st charles missouri astronics corporation atro founded in  astronics corporation designs and manufactures products for the aerospace and defense industries it

manufacturing closetolerance titanium and aluminum components  composites and metal bonding das produces helicopter main and tail rotor blades and adhesive bonded assemblies including winglets spoilers and fuselage structural panels for aircraft chemical milling chemical milling is used to remove materials in specific areas to reduce weights in regions where full thickness in materials is not required some of the products that use this type of milling are jet engine components wing leading edges and fuselage skins  dti panels and switches dti offers manufactures illuminated switches switch assemblies keyboard panels edge lit panels microwave and millimeterwave switches mechanical and electromechanical subassemblies dtis products include sophisticated radar enclosures gyroscopes and indicators aircraft avionics racks and shipboard communications and control enclosures engineering technical and program management services these services are offered principally for advanced weapons systems and missile defense primarily for united states defense space and homeland security programs  price as with many other aerospace services companies in the industry ducommun will rarely if ever market any of their products based on price it would be quite uncommon for any firm in this industry to market their products with a low price strategy as means to attract new customers ducommun makes multiyear firm fixedprice commitments to its customers however without assurance to the companys anticipated production costs the company faces a risk of experiencing negative losses place ducommun provides its products and services both domestically in the united states and internationally the company has manufacturing facilities in thailand and mexico in  sales to foreign customers worldwide were  or  of total revenues  promotion in respect of the current customers ducommun promotes its products through its reputation of superior quality products in order to attract new contracts ducommun relies on presentations at aerospace and defense conferences however the marketing for companies in this industry is a very difficult area to measure the data provided in the  annual report did not provide much information to give more insight for a better understanding of ducommun marketing techniques supply chain the ducommun supply chain team works with the global supply base to ensure the highest level of performance in the areas of quality cost delivery and service ducommun continues to develop mutually benefit supplier relationships resulting in positive growth for all members of the supply chain cost reductions are being accomplished through commodity management and resulting in an increase of long term agreements and supplier alliances human resources ducommuns success is powered by the development and full commitment of its employees at the end of  the company reported a total of  employees  key personnel  executive compensation  ducommun acquisitions in the past five years acquisitions ducommun has deployed more than  million in the last five years completing multiple strategic acquisitions dynabill industries is a leading provider of titanium and aluminum structural components and assemblies for commercial and military aerospace applications the company was acquired for  cmp display system was bought by ducommun for  cmp manufactures incandescent electroluminescent and led edge lit panels and assemblies for the aerospace and defense industries wisewave is a manufacturer of microwave and millimeterwave products for both aerospace and nonaerospace applications the price of the transaction to ducommun was  miltec provides its services through engineering technical and program management this includes design development integration and test of prototype product mainly for the aerospace and military segment this company was bought for  strategy analysis strengths patented processes and technical superiority the company has several patents that allow their products to be of top quality despite having a wide array of patents ducommun does not believe that its operations are dependent on any single patent or group of patents rather the company prides itself on its technical superiority continual product improvement exclusive product features superior lead time ontime delivery performance quality and customer relationships to maintain its competitive advantage  growth initiative strong order backlog the order backlog is the value of the orders that a manufacturer has signed but not completed and been paid for yet at the end of  backlog was approximately  compared to  at the end of  this value of unfilled orders assures the company a steady stream of revenues in the future years despite any occurrences of unusual events focus on organic and inorganic growth the company follows its operations to be in line with its strategic long term goals the company had revenues of  million in  ducommun currently has a growth initiative to raise this revenue level to the  billion mark by the end of   it plans to achieve this through a combination of organic and inorganic growth organic growth is the growth rate that a company can achieve by increasing output and enhancing sales with the current resources it has on the other hand inorganic growth is growth in the operations of a business that arises from mergers or takeovers rather than an increase in the companies own business activity error creating thumbnail weaknesses high reliance on defense spending by militaryspace products in  approximately  of sales were derived from military and space markets these markets largely depend on government spending particularly the united states government despite forecasts of increasing defense spending forecasts are just forecasts high dependence on boeing raytheon and united technologies in  ducommun sales were approximately  for boeing aircraft programs  for raytheon military aircraft programs and  for united technologies specifically the sikorsky blackhawk helicopter program  with just under  of the entire revenues coming from three companies ducommun loses a lot of supplier power to these companies losses on fixedprice contracts ducommun sells many of its products under fixedprice contracts this means that the company would be receiving a set revenue for the contract despite the costs incurred by the company as a result if any manufacturing inefficiencies startup costs or other factors cause an increase in production costs ducommun is very susceptible to experiencing losses opportunities rising global defense spending the united states remains the global leader in defense spending surpassing the next closest country by more than eight times the global financial and economic crisis has resulted in many nations cutting back on all sorts of public spending  and yet military spending seems to be increasing  growing demand of commercial airplanes the growth in commercial airplane market is be  trillion by  by that year  the commercial airplane fleet globally is expected increase to twice the size as compared to the current fleet size it is forecasted that the passenger traffic would grow at around  annually till  requiring approximately  additional commercial airplanes to meet the rising traffic the asiapacific region is projected to be the largest market making up  of the  trillion market north america is second with  of the market share  threats consolidation in the aerospace industry the industry that ducommun operates in is experiencing significant consolidation this includes the companys suppliers customers and competitors if the suppliers face consolidation ducommun faces the threat of fewer resources of supply andor higher costs consolidation in the customers has the potential to result in delays in the time ducommun takes to receive a contract award or the loss of existingpotential customers consolidation in the competitors may create competitors with higher resources and therefore cause a loss in the companys market share financial analysis general  ducommon is on the smaller end when compared in market capitalization to the industry however it is very similar to its two competitors lmia and atro looking at the beta the average of dco and its competitors is a little below  showing very a higher than usual sensitivity to the market conditions one thing to note from the above comparable is that dco has a large number of employees compared to lmia and atro which are similar market cap companies valuation  due the ducommun’s positive earnings pe price to book and evebitda ratios are the most appropriate valuation measures the price to sales ratio is less informative than the pe since the company has positive earnings comparing dco to its competitors and the industry we see that the company is undervalued in all measures this can be a good sign showing that the company is expected by the financial markets to record high earnings and sales and eventually increase its book value growth and profitability  error creating thumbnail dco revenue vs net income  the company’s margin percentages are slightly lower when compared to the industry and competitor averages a point to note from the image on the right is that the company had a compound annual growth rate of  in the past  years  was the first time in  years where the revenue had a negative growth however on a more positive note dco grew earnings in the face of decreased revenues over the past twelve months this is a trend that is not sustainable if profits are to continue to decrease at this rate however this result was better than that of the average company in the aerospace  defense industry financial strength  dco uses little debt in its capital structure at a total debttotal capital ratio of  the company is substantially less exposed to debt compared to the competitors and industry it has been also decreasing its debt quarter over quarter at a faster rate than the industry overall dco has less financial risk than the industry aggregate dco also has very good liquidity ratios with a quick ratio of  and an interest coverage of  the company should be able to comfortably pay back any short term obligations management effectiveness  dco is doing an acceptable job in comparison to its peers with a return on assets and return on investment of  and  respectively despite average performance at managing their resources the company is below average at generating revenues from employees and managing their owners equity compared to other companies in the aerospace  defense industry dco has a roe of  compared to the industry average of  revenue per employee at dco equals  much below the  average of the industry overall dco is not managing its resources as effectively as its competitors and the industry as a whole references ↑          ducommun inc k  annual report ↑ das facilities ↑
