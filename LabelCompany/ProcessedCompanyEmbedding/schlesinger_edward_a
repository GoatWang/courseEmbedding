about pathological psychology i greatly appreciated this honour and tried to sum up before the american students some elementary psychological researches about a wellknown disease hysteria in order to show them how the study of the mental state of the patient can sometimes be useful to explain many disturbances and to give some unity to apparently discordant symptoms the fifteen lectures presented in this book were given in the harvard medical school between the fifteenth of october and the end of november  some of these lectures were also delivered in johns hopkins university at baltimore at

worldwide this book lays no claim to be a comprehensive treatise upon the psychology of insanity the number of independent schools of thought existing at the present day and the fundamental divergence in their methods of investigation make it obviously impossible to compress such a treatise into the limits of a small volume all that has been attempted here is the presentation of certain recent developments in abnormal psychology which have already yielded results of fundamental importance and which seem to offer an exceptionally promising field for further investigation many of the theories to which he will be introduced have not as yet been firmly established a very large number of the general principles enunciated in this book are due to the genius of prof freud of vienna probably the most original and fertile thinker who has yet entered the field of abnormal psychology although however i cannot easily express the extent to which i am indebted to him i am by no means prepared to embrace the whole of the vast body of doctrines which freud and his followers have now laid downpreface psycinfo database record c  apa all rights reserved equilibrium and vertigo by isaac h jones book  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide a presentday conception of mental disorders by c macfie campbell book  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this lecture proposes to deal with human nature working under difficulties and to choose one small portion of that broad problem i should like to interest you in some facts rather than in words in a sample of the real stuff of human life rather than in the traditional and threadbare phrases with which we too often disguise the actual world giving ourselves a pleasing illusion of knowledge i ask you therefore to consider our topic to be not mental disorders but men women and children in difficulty suffering hoping thwarted groping many people are suffering from a mental disorder who in the current estimate of their friends are considered only as eccentric model disagreeable extreme wicked virtuous emancipated etc the same situation is met in regard to other disorders in referring to a reaction as a mental disorder we do not necessarily mean that the condition is severe or serious mental disorders may be mild just as physical disorders may be mental indigestion may be of as many degrees as physical indigestion and an emotional disturbance may be as mild as an attack of chickenpox mental disorder may masquerade under many disguises and human nature in difficulties may resort to many subtle evasions and modes of defense we are so much under the spell of oldfashioned conceptions of human behavior that the real driving forces of the personality escape us while we label behavior with the conventional ethical or social terms there are a group of patients of people who recognize that they are sick and come to the physician for treatment they admit that they have a disorder but they are perhaps indignant at the suggestion that their trouble is mental their symptoms may have nothing mental about them but may be the ordinary symptoms of respectable ailments they come for their headache or dizziness or weakness or they have palpitation or fainting attacks or their digestive system is a source of much interest and annoyance or they have indications that some of the other internal organs are out of gear yet these apparently simple symptoms may be of complex origin they may be the outcroppings above the surface of important emotional reactions only to be understood in the setting of these reactions we have to discard our mediæval attitude toward these sick or handicapped people and to study the problem which they present as a problem of human nature working under difficulties we have to study the disordered behavior of the total organism in the same way in which we study the disordered behavior of a single organ when we come to those farreaching disorders of the personality in which the patient suffers from profound melancholy or gives way to exuberant excitement or is dominated by sounds or voices of subjective origin or sees the world banded against him in a strange web of persecution the principles of explanation so far utilized seem to leave us in the lurch neither structural damage nor chronic poisoning of the brain nor simple disorder of the instincts explains these specifically human disorders a modern attitude to these ailments means that at the earliest indication of trouble when treatment has most chance of being useful these patients will be encouraged to seek advice where there are available suitable facilities for diagnosis and treatmentbook psycinfo database record c
