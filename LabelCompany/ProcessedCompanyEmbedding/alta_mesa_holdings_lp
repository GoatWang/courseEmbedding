credo over the companys history  it shapes our longterm vision and guides our daytoday strategies alta mesa is a privately held company engaged in onshore oil and natural gas acquisition exploitation exploration and production whose focus is to maximize the profitability of our assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner we seek to maintain a portfolio of lower risk properties in plays where we identify a large inventory of drilling development and enhanced recovery and exploitation opportunities in known resources we believe our balanced portfolio of assets in the oklahoma stack play and south louisiana has decades of future development potential we maximize the profitability of our assets by focusing on advanced engineering analytics enhanced geological techniques including d seismic analysis and proven drilling stimulation completion and production methods  our areas of focus are typically characterized by multiple hydrocarbon pay zones and because we are redeveloping fields and areas left behind by major oil and natural gas companies and other previous operators our assets are typically served by existing infrastructure  as a result our approach lowers geological mechanical and marketrelated risks we focus on properties within our core operating areas that we believe have significant development and exploration opportunities and where we can apply our technical experience and economies of scale to increase production and proved reserves while lowering lease operating and capital costs additionally we have consistently created value through workovers and recompletions of existing wells infill drilling operations improvements secondary recovery and d seismicdriven drilling  we expect to continue production growth in our core areas through continued well workovers enhanced drilling and recovery programs and disciplined exploration we periodically enter into and actively manage hedging transactions for a portion of our oil and natural gas production  this allows us to reduce exposure to price fluctuations and achieve more predictable cash flows while retaining commodity upside through future production and reserve growth the alta mesa

over  years and are located in the eastern portion of the anadarko basin referred to as the stack the stack is an acronym describing both its location—sooner trend anadarko basin canadian and kingfisher county—and the multiple stacked productive formations present in the area the stack is a prolific hydrocarbon system with high oil and liquidsrich natural gas content multiple horizontal target horizons extensive production history and historically high drilling success ratesthe fields were originally developed by texaco exxon and conoco and have historically been shallowdecline longlived oil wells originally drilled on acre spacing and waterflooded to varying degrees beginning in the early s our stack operations were focused on vertical wells and waterfloods since late  however we have concentrated on the horizontal development of the mississippianage osage and meramec formations as well as the pennsylvanianage oswego formation generally speaking these formations are made up of siliceous carbonate and have highly naturally fractured reservoir and geologic systems we intend to further develop other formations with demonstrated vertical production using horizontal drilling including the pennsylvanianage big lime prue skinner red fork and cherokee shale mississippianage manning lime devonianage woodford shale and silurianage hunton lime given the predictable geology of the stack formations this allows for a repeatable drilling inventory we have about  potential drilling locations across four benches with multiple upside locations possible through optimized spacing and targeting of additional producing horizons  the stack is among the lowest cost basins in the us with asset quality comparable to the permian alta mesa is an efficient operator with a proven track record and focus on continuous improvement we have worked diligently to reduce the drilling and completion costs per well thru operating and drilling efficiencies we have doubled our stack acreage position to over k net highly contiguous acres since january  most of which are held by production our contiguous acreage positions allows for efficient field development through optimal spacing and pad drilling  the legacy infrastructure systems in this area that will support the development of our stack assets is mature extensive and readily expandable new systems with high capacity for development have been built to accommodate higher individual well rates from horizontal wells and the anticipated significant growth expected from our use of multiwell pads the kingfisher midstream cryogenic plant is a larger capacity system and modern plant that has a capacity of  mmcf per day and ties newer acreage to central legacy leasehold   south louisianaalta mesa has three major areas of operation in south louisiana in fields originally developed by major oil companies where we have working interests in over  producing wells and approximately  gross developed and undeveloped acres  acres net these areas have multiple lowrisk exploration and development targets potential for exploiting substantial bypassed and overlooked oil pay zones and opportunities to increase profitability through facilities debottlenecking production enhancements and drilling weeks island field  weeks island located in iberia parish contains some of our largest developed oil reserves it is a historicallyprolific oil field with  potential pay zones that are structurally trapped against a piercement salt dome which we believe offer significant future opportunities for added production and reserves the main field pay zones are characterized by high stable production rates due to the predominant waterdrive production mechanism and highporosity sands the field was discovered in  by shell and subsequently developed by shell and exxon we acquired these properties in  with our acquisition of meridian which had purchased them in  we operate all of the wells in this field in which we have an interest since mid we have continuously employed one drilling rig and one completion rig in weeks island to exploit its potential for development through sidetracking new drilling and recompletions additionally weeks island oil sales prices are based on the louisiana light sweet crude market price index which has trended appreciably higher than the west texas
