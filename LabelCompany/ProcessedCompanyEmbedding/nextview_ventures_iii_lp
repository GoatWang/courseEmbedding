traction the nextview podcast           fundraising how to evaluate investors for a seed vc syndicate david beisel • june   •  min read when raising a round of seed venture capital founders often focus the bulk of their time and energy on securing meetings and nailing their pitches — and rightfully so it’s absolutely critical to secure that first interested party in order to more easily convince other investors to join and complete your round of funding but what about that latter part what happens when you actually do succeed in generating interest and now the task is to round out the fundraise with multiple firms on board the process wherein a vc syndicate crystallizes to close a seedstage investment can be complex and unclear from the outside yet it represents a vital step in the process for founders below i aim to shed light on the decisionmaking process to help entrepreneurs better evaluate firms for a seed vc syndicate before we begin it’s important to acknowledge that there are actually two common and distinct strategies for raising a seed round of capital  subscription approach – an entrepreneur sets a structure usually a convertible note and recruits individual angel investors who subscribe to the round all without a termdriving lead investor  termdriving investor approach – an entrepreneur finds a lead institutional investor or quasiinstitutional to price and set the structure and dynamics of the round working together to bring in additional syndicate partners these syndicate partners might be other seedstage funds individual angels or both as a quick aside the subscription approach might also include venture capital firms but this is typically for very “hot” companies or in a competitive environment like at a y combinator demo day  deciding between the above two options is a post for another day but when entrepreneurs select the latter route and multiple vcs invest together founders are then faced with the daunting task of navigating the murky waters of all the various firms who are active seedstage investors — and many more who at least market themselves as such despite their sweet spot lying somewhere in later rounds and while we’ve seen an increasing amount of information and transparency about the players in this market it can be challenging to embark on a set of initial meetings with investors without an understanding of how these vc syndicates are formed factors to consider for a vc syndicate every firm whether it follows a dedicated seed venture strategy a full lifecycle approach or somewhere in between has a set of qualities that affect how they would fit into a seed venture round syndicate editor’s note we hope you find this post useful regardless of whether you interact with nextview ventures however since we often receive questions about our approach to each of these factors nextviewspecific information has been added after each check size some firms have a typical seed check size which is their standard bite size as low as fivefigures as high as seven others are check size agnostic and therefore very flexible because it’s just about the option on the following round still others have different decisionmaking processes for different check sizes within a seed round unfortunately this figure is rarely if ever on a firm’s website and must be asked during the first meeting at nextview check size varies but generally falls between k and m per investment willingness to lead this leadership dynamic is important especially when talking with seedonly funds as many firms have an explicit strategy of only participating in a round coming together with a thirdparty lead syndicate vc partner i’ve seen many entrepreneurs find themselves with numerous parties “interested to follow” but without a firm willing to catalyze the process there is some correlation here though not complete alignment to check size ie larger check writers have a greater tendency to lead rounds at nextview we have a bias but not a requirement towards leading a round and we always syndicate with other institutional and individual investors since we are a seedfocused firm the only time nextview leads is during a seed round though we reserve followon capital for our existing portfolio company’s future rounds of financing level of lead investor’s involvement postfinancing venture firms approach involvement after a seed round wildly differently for larger full lifecycle firms which also make a number of earlystage investments partner involvement can be little to none at the seed stage yet for some of these firms the partner may be more hands on if the startup “counts” as a full investment within their partnership dynamics it all depends on a specific firm’s approach similarly even for dedicated seedstage vcs partner involvement can vary depending on a firm’s strategy in both cases the amount of time spent is generally inversely proportional to the number of new seed investments the firm does a whole each year at nextvew each partner makes just a handful of investments per year where there’s high conviction and alignment with founders as we believe in being handson and offering support during the first few formative years of a company’s growth board seat requirements partner involvement after seed financing can but doesn’t always require codification with a board seat the board seat dance at the seed stage can be a challenge on either direction occasionally no firms want to designate someone’s time for the role while other times more than one investor may be looking for an official board role despite not being a fit at this stage this dynamic typically unfolds based on how involved a partner plans to be with a given company ie more time spent translates into more desire for board seat but some firms are satisfied with “inbetween” measures like official board observer status and defined information rights at nextview we typically like to take a board seat or board observer role during the first  months when we feel we can have the greatest impact and provide the most guidance additional systematic valueadd after investment some vcs can add an additional set of benefits for instance corporate strategic investors often offer unique support for operating businesses while firms with large portfolios may have network effects among its companies partners and staff additionally some larger vcs might offer a range of “fullservice” support options including pr recruiting and other functions there are many ways that venture firms can help their portfolio ceos during the seedstage in lieu of — or in addition to — partner involvement all of which can be a real plus but may not be immediately obvious to founders during the fundraise process at nextview we aim to add additional value through a suite of educational and business development initiatives for both the portfolio and greater startup community run by our director of platform geography it’s always easiest for a vc to make an investment in his or her own backyard especially at the seed stage where partner involvement is so critical geography thus becomes a more acute issue so as a general rule seedstage firms have a greater tendency than larger firms to follow a strategy which focuses on a particular city or region of all the attributes in this list geographic preference is perhaps the easiest for founders to discern just from looking at a portfolio company list on a vc’s site but actions speak louder than words – sometimes vc firms would like to market geographic focus or agnosticism but in practice it deviates no matter what a vc says the proverbial bar is higher in making an investment outside their typical geography however that’s defined at nextview we invest solely in usheadquartered companies with about  of that activity happening between boston and new york sector focus or lack thereof like geography sector focus can be more readily gleaned from a portfolio company list than from a firm’s marketing as the two sometimes differ after all where a firm has been and where it wants to go can be two different things some funds promote themselves as completely focusing on a particular space while others take a broader approach it’s important for the partner and firm to have some background in the area of a new investment but extremely heavy investor concentration in a particular space can have risks in addition to rewards for an entrepreneur at nextview our focus tends to come from other factors such as stage of growth and geography and as a result we invest across a number of sectors from bb saas to consumer apps to platform companies to deeper technical plays like ad tech infrastructure and much more this is best seen on our site under “investments” followon capital many people have covered this topic in the blogosphere about the perils of venture firms’ signaling in followon financing subsequent to seed rounds for those unfamiliar the quick summary if a laterstage vc invests in your seed round but declines future rounds that signals to other investors that something might be amiss making later rounds harder to raise it’s not worth rehashing the dialogue in full here other than to say that signaling issue of larger lifecycle vcs is real period we’ve seen it directly in our portfolio companies raising successive rounds that being said there are indeed clear benefits to having deep pockets at the table immediately from the seed round i think that the most important aspect of this issue is for a venture firm to state a clear followon approach and be consistent in implementing it the most trouble comes when a player’s intentions are unknown or undefined or inconsistently applied so that there are surprises in the subsequent followon process at nextview since we don’t lead later rounds and won’t invest for the first time unless it’s seedstage potential signaling issues are nonexistent and again we do reserve followon capital for our existing portfolio company’s future rounds of financing led by other investors conflicts of interest in existing portfolio especially given that some seedonly funds follow a rapid deployment strategy in making dozens of investments annually competitive conflicts of new investments and even existing investments with others in a portfolio can be a real factor some firms are lax about these conflicts which indeed are sometimes inevitable when startups pivot while others are very strict about not having more than one company in a general space but i have observed vc firms intentionally invest in competitive offerings at nextview we won’t make a new investment in a startup which at the time of that investment would be competitive with one of our existing portfolio companies prestige of a firm or investor nobody explicitly talks about it because it’s implied prestige matters it matters in a lot of things from recruiting all the way to attracting that next round of financing on the margin higherprestige seed investors attract higher quality series a investors at nextview we strive to earn the respect of entrepreneurs and coinvestors with whom we work every day to build great companies institutional lps and standard vc fund structure why a vc’s fund structure matters to an entrepreneur isn’t immediately obvious it’s about consistency of behavior for example the more traditional “plain vanilla” the structure the more the investors are going to be motivated based on financial gains on a consistent basis that’s not to say that these traditional vcs are going to behave badly just that any and all behavior and expectations from your investors should be consistent so at least you know the driving force motivating their actions less formalized sources or nontraditional structures of capital on the other hand can sometimes exhibit more erratic nonfinancially motivated behavior thus when a syndicate forms understanding structural bounds and consistency in investor actions is key for each member of the partnership to avoid surprises down the road at nextview this is best explained by visiting our site and clicking “approach” to view our investment model and more info on our partnership dynamics personal dynamics last but certainly not least is the answer to an extremely important question do you as the entrepreneur want to work with both the person and partnership on the other side of the table are you merely holding your nose because the money is green or do you truly want to work alongside this person for the months and years to come at nextview we’re solely focused on seed and go to painstaking lengths to invest in a small number of companies in order to be handson partners we therefore believe this is one of or even the most important factor to consider when a founder evaluates other firms to syndicate a round building an optimal seed vc syndicate putting together a seed vc syndicate of one or more firms is like fitting together many puzzle pieces there are different “right” attributes for a startup’s round depending on the situation and even then those characteristics can be assembled by selecting one firm which most closely matches or by aggregating a series of participants which bring a couple of those attributes to the table the key in building the optimal seed vc syndicate is to figure out what qualities should be present and then construct a scenario which includes them with one or more partners without doing easy homework and asking the right questions up front entrepreneurs can miss out on including valuable investors in the round or add too many nonvaluable or “redundant” constituents which just complicate the composition and communication going forward at times larger lifecycle vcs aren’t as consistent in their approach to the above list because the exact parameters of a seed investment aren’t clearly defined internally it’s not their main focus or even a major priority in some cases dedicated seed firms on the other hand often have a fairly set and consistent answer to most of these questions as participating in seed rounds is their bread and butter yet even then it’s not ever black and white or wholly consistent my hope is that this list helps you navigate this increasingly complex process this post originally appeared on nextview cofounder and partner david beisel’s

templates for great startup pitch decks direct from vcs david beisel • february   •  min read today nextview ventures is excited to release a pillar project in our growth guides series pitch deck templates for raising seed capital these help address a common question which we frequently receive from entrepreneurs about how to create startup pitch decks for this crucial financial milestone for context last year based on questions from our existing portfolio we launched two board deck templates for seedstage startups these were wellreceived so we next turned our attention to entrepreneurs outside the portfolio to ask what questions we could address in a similar fashion the response was consistent and clear “thanks for those board decks — hope to use them someday — but i’m still raising a seed round right now what makes a great pitch deck” this answer was somewhat surprising — there seem to be several templates like this which already exist but the feedback we received was that those decks a are somewhat generic and not built specifically for seedstage startups which often require more art than science during the pitch and b lack storytelling components and design and layout sensibility so we hope these two deck resources can address both issues we also aimed to take these one step further by adding our own vc commentary throughout the slides and by providing two different somewhat unique versions of great pitch decks read on for more context or download your templates right here download pitch deck templates clicking will take you to a dropbox page where you can download the file two unique pitch deck styles jay acunzo our vp of platform who largely created these slides asked us a poignant question before we began this project aside from the accepted format of pitch decks today what did we as vcs wish they could be if we’re designing a great earlystage startup pitch from the ground up what would that look like from our perspective at nextview startup pitch meetings should come in two flavors the first is a conversation usually when raising a seed round your pitch process with a vc firm starts with a small number of meetings with just one or two team members — or else you’re pitching angel investors individually in those contexts it’s a lot less likely that you’ll want to stand up and “pitch” a deck usually a more human interaction works better you introduce yourself you talk about why you started your company and you start digging into the details in a conversational way this is the way my partners and i tend to operate in our initial meetings too whether we’re being pitched or raising money ourselves in the end i think discussionbased meetings are simply the way people want to interact with others they’re speaking with for the first time it just feels more human and natural in addition to helping both sides learn a great deal about the other the second type of pitch is more of a show maybe you are presenting in front of a crowd in a demoday scenario or perhaps it’s to a larger group like the full partnership of a big firm in these cases the interaction is very very different it tends to be more oneway — more of a presentation than a discussion in these pitches you have to carefully choose the details into which you dive more deeply since you don’t want anything to go over people’s heads nor do you want to confuse an audience that lacks the ability to have a backandforth discussion to find clarity instead what you actually want to do is drive home the story and the excitement of the opportunity as well as the inevitability of your success emotion is a bit more crucial here since this may be the first or only major interaction you have with these people during your fundraise but here’s the problem we often encounter with the standard pitch deck most fundraising decks are a poor compromise between the needs of both of these meetings — conversation and show — and so they leave much to be desired as an investor generally speaking to address this and slightly rethink what pitches should be we created two different suggested templates for fundraising decks a short explainer with a “kitchen sink” faq section and another style we’ve dubbed “the show” some quick context on each pitch deck template  explainer  kitchen sink appendix the first template you’ll encounter is designed for a discussionbased pitch it’s super short – just a handful of slides to convey the basic critical details up front however it includes a “kitchen sink” of faqs in the appendix the shortness of the up front pitch can be incredibly helpful oneonone when you’re speaking to an investor you can say “i have a few slides that might help introduce the company but we can keep it pretty conversational and dive into specific questions once you get the gist” it fits the format but it also allows you to demonstrate mastery over the details of your business by pulling up a slide from the appendix ifwhen the discussion requires it does the vc have a detailed question about the product roadmap no problem just turn to page  in the appendix did the discussion evolve into an exploration of your gotomarket strategy perfect — easily pull up page  in the appendix as a backdrop to the conversation also you don’t need to sweat the order of the details in the appendix to weave the pieces together like a highschool essay the first few slides are neatly and logically ordered while the appendix serves as backup as my partner rob go points out this approach puts you on more equal footing with an investor “it’s less of a ‘pitch to me’ kind of interaction and more of a discussion which is really good in building early trust and rapport” the appendix becomes a flexible goto resource to augment a genuine dialog with the investor this explainerkitchen sink approach allows for a natural discussion to unfold while still clearly demonstrating that you’ve come fully prepared and have a strong handle on your business in a oneonone setting this format is going to have much more of an impact than the more rote “flipbook” of slide after slide pitch deck template  the show this second deck is great for the second type of meeting where there’s a larger audience this is when emotiondriven stories delivered start to finish make more sense the show is longer and very focused on telling a cohesive narrative that elicits a hopefully positive emotional response by including the show in our templates we’re also acknowledging that certain settings aren’t well suited to digging into all of the details of the business and that different members of the audience likely start from different places in their understanding of what’s going in on your company and your market that said the show isn’t just fluff it should demonstrate good prioritization of the details that matter from the entrepreneur you need to have just as much mastery over your business as in the case of the other pitch deck in the event that an investor wants to dig in a bit further like all templates these are just guides and you probably don’t want to include absolutely everything in your own deck as you flip through the slides which we’ve created look for the callouts from my partners and i to inform your own versions pitching nextview some context although we hope this helps entrepreneurs generally we recognize that some of the audience reading might eventually meet with someone at nextview to that end i wanted to share at least a little context which is simply this stay true to your own style and comfort level don’t feel the need to directly utilize either or both of these templates — they’re merely suggested guides for those at the beginning of the deck creation process not prescriptions on how things have to be done every startup is unique and so are the best ways to present them without further ado i encourage you to download these templates and share with anyone that might benefit

the same dates…for example we worked on these priority tasks for a three month period here are the raw numbers in the traction column and the growth rates in the growth column what numbers would go in the tractiongrowth columns for “drive initial signups” i’m confused because there is a “target results” row that says “x initial users” sorry if i’m asking the wrong questions or have completely misinterpreted this slide i’d like to figure out what’s going on best omeid jay acunzo if i’m understanding your questions correctly you’re looking at the exact inputs of certain slides you should treat those as merely placeholders and rework all of them based on your specific business for example you might not say “drive user signups” in general the slides are meant to be directional to show
