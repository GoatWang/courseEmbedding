word chipmakers remain wary of data sharinga letter from ali salehpour—slimming down and scaling up how thin devices are transforming the osat industryali salehpoursenior vice president and general manager new markets and service groupevery so often it happens our industry reaches a major inflection point and suddenly everything changes we experienced it when the internet became ubiquitous and pcs drove chip demand we experienced it again when smartphones and other mobile devices shifted chip demand and as mobile devices become thinner and thinner we’ve reached a new inflection point the line between where wafer processing ends and packaging begins is now blurred and the result is nothing less than the transformation of the outsourced semiconductor assembly and test osat industrynot so long ago product packaging was a pretty straightforward proposition the first iphone used just  waferlevel packages the latest iphone  uses  today’s consumers clearly want it all thin mobile devices that provide complex functions in a convenient form factor it’s a challenge our industry has to meet but howthat’s the focus of this issue of nanochip fab solutions in these pages you’ll learn why chip manufacturing can no longer be neatly divided between frontend and backend processes we discuss how osats are implementing fablike advanced control processes and wafer fab equipment to deliver on the demand for more complex packaging and you’ll learn why fanout wafer scale packaging throughsilicon vias tsvs and fab automation technologies are key enablers for this industry transitionautomation technology has wider implications for both frontend and osat manufacturers and it’s another theme we explore in multiple articles when it comes to fab productivity increasing the yield and output side of the equation has a far greater impact than simply reducing costs you’ll read how using automation software to optimize every production step—from planning to dispatching— can overcome fab inefficiencies and enable manufacturers to meet the demand of fastchanging marketsan outstanding example is rf supplier qorvo in richardson texas which we profile in this issue by investing in fab automation software and hardware qorvo has empowered its workforce and increased production of bulk acoustic wave baw filters x over the last  years using refurbished mm and mm tools that growth will undoubtedly continue as demand for g smartphones proliferates worldwide—and applied’s commitment to supporting legacy tools will enable qorvo to meet itin addition new applied tools are being developed to help customers maximize the value of big data one example discussed in this issue is our nextgeneration fault detection and classification ngfdc solution it includes enhancements that significantly reduce setup times improve fault detection with fewer false alarms and leverage big data capabilities to decrease response times and increase depth of analysisno matter how this current inflection point reshapes our industry however applied’s essential goal remains the same to solve problems for customers enabling their success whether you’re an osat who depends on highly reliable legacy tools or a fab manager who needs stateoftheart solutions our product and service portfolio is designed for you as mobile and wearable devices continue to slim down we will
