timewe raised k so its happening were young entrepreneurs who are passionate about design community and the small things in life that help us all feel better we all met at the university of minnesota in the start up capital of the north our team includes left to right alexander ham hambrock coleman iverson nadya nguyen daniel worku and alexandra feeken were a team of engineers designers marketers and developers  in september  our ceo nadya pulled together a team of fellow university of minnesota students for the google startup weekend in minneapolis minnesota to build the first smart water bottle prototype in just  hours we built a water bottle that tracked water intake and synced to a mobile app on a smartphone we won third place and people began asking when the water bottles would be available for purchase that’s the moment we knew they were on to something the team worked evenings and weekends for  months before being accepted into the sprint mobile health accelerator powered by techstars  we quit our jobs and left everything behind to work on a product that we believed in the program is a  monthlong intensive onsite experience in kansas city mo in which  mobilehealth companies selected from around the world receive funding and mentorship to accelerate their businesses we reiterated multiple bottle designs before deciding to go with the final hidrate me the lid was another challenge in itself and we d printed and tested several before finalizing our design        risks and challenges manufacturing the bottle many small companies face difficulties when it comes to manufacturing new products from design problems to unexpected costs thats why weve made it a priority from the very beginning to involve manufacturers every step of the way catching issues before they had a chance to become problems members of our team have seen multiple products through from concept to manufacturing shipping in winter  we plan to place the manufacturing order by the end of june  well be reviewing samples in august and september december of   january  is our shipping estimate when we account for both making revisions and getting the first shipment in from the factory battery life our testing shows that the included battery will power the hidrate me bottle for well over a year we are still doing additional testing and tweaking to make sure that the battery life will be at least a year learn about accountability on kickstarter questions about this project check out the faq report this project to kickstarter support this project select this reward pledge  or

foundation to help fight against kidney disease i want one hidratesparkpeople love their hidrate spark bottles  customer reviews based on  reviews write a review   utc matt said i may seem dumb i have been doing a lot of traveling and unfortunately i am not always able to keep track of how much fluid ive been drinking in a given day i usually try to drink as much as possible but then again i dont like to be stopping to go to a bathroom every  minutes either enter the spark  which through the apps simple circular tracking bar i know if i have been drinking enough for the time of day temperature and the number of steps ive taken it is incredibly helpful to have my spark water bottle reminding me to keep drinking as there have been too many days of running around a desert and flopping down for the night with a splitting dehydration headache the app is also very consistant at syncing with fitbit so if i am looking at the weekly fitness goals i can see if i have been keeping up my water consumption by looking at the fitbit dashboard i highly recommend this waterbottle   utc kathy glass said well worth the wait initially i was disappointed that my husband purchased this bottle as a mothers day gift and he wasnt aware of the backlog on orders so fast forward  months and im so pleased with my hydrate  the motivational messages really have you reaching for the bottle and once you get it calibrated youre on your way   utc josh said nice design its design makes me haapy i gonna buy a different colour one   utc karen said love it i have purchased my water bottle in january i just love it its great that you can add friends to it and watch how much they are drinking along with you if anyone is looking for friends to add here is my email address bttrflykmhotmailcom   utc julie said a teachers best friend i absolutely love my bottle because i usually dont drink enough water during the day when im teaching and sometimes come home with a horrible headache now i simply put my bottle on my desk and my students alert me as soon as it starts to light up and then i simply have to make time to drink or my students will complain no more headaches since i have the bottle and now all my colleagues want one too please deliver in europe soon because i was lucky enough to get one via a friend in the us but my colleagues want one too and they dont have the right connections   utc megan said wonderful overall i love this water bottle it has put me back on track drinking water and i love the app however i wish it kept the streak going longer than each week such as weeks or months or ever years if you make it that far i will say i had a few times with syncing in the beginning but the tech support people were wonderful and i also had a faulty lid but they fixed that issue the only thing i have noticed since those two issues were resolved is the rubber band thing that helps flip the lid open broke a few months after i got the replacement lid and i was surprised since i only hand wash my bottle and its parts and i take excellent care of my bottle since i love it so much so now i have to manually flip my lid open since it wont flippop open anymore since the band broke and it syncs to my fitbit which i love though i do wish it would log the water in myfitnesspal also since i love in that as well but overall i love this bottle and will definitely always have one   utc kristyn said love it i purchased my bottle after my second kidney stone results came back my doctor said my body was not processing salt properly and that i needed to drink at least  ounces of water a day i tried to keep track on my own but would loose track throughout the day i purchased this bottle and fell in love i have drank more water since getting than i ever have i love how it flashes and sends me a text to remind me to drink more   utc stacey said hidrate spark helps my sick child i just wanted to say how much the hidrate spark has helped my five year old daughter in the last two years she has been very sick due to chronic kidney infections and has had many er visits doctors visits and one week stay in the hospital due to her not ever being thirsty or wanting to drink we finally got to the bottom of why she was getting so sick and it was bc no matter how hard we tried she just never wanted to drink anything and when she doesnt drink she gets sick within a day or so to the point of vomiting i have purchased many cups and water bottles over the last two years trying to entice her to drink and each time being a failure they specialist told us that if she doesnt drink like she needs to she will end up with a kidney transplant by the time she is a teenager one day i happened to see the video about the hidrate spark bottle on facebook and went out on a limb and purchased the water bottle and to see how much it is holding she and i accountable and how she likes to beat the clock to drink her water she had beat her goal each day this week and i am so proud and also thankful for your invention i have recommended your water bottle to several of my clients bc i am so happy with the results thank you so much hidrate spark for helping my baby stay healthy   utc jill said heartyourkidneys with some unexpected delays this is the best decision ive made customer service has been fantastic and i love the water bottle with the notifications   utc amanda said awesome product when i saw this i thought how much water can it really help me drink well the answer is a whole heck of a lot i drink at least twice as much as i used to and now feel the benefits if you are on the fence do it   utc teri said love i love my new water bottle never leave home without and have been definitely been drinking more water the only thing i dont like is the finish on the bottle is peeling from going in and out of the cup holder in my car   utc marsha said love would go any other brand knowing i am getting my  ounces water everyday and one thing more i have dropped mine so many times already and still works not even a chip i have to agree when you drank water else without your glass and forgot to add it in before  am you dont make your goal   utc jenn said absolutely in love absolutely am in love with this water bottle well worth the wait although i wish i had ordered two now the notifications that are sent to my phone are funny but helpful it took a little bit to get it to sync to my fitbit app but once i did ive been using both religiously now love love love ❤️ i will say that if more than one is purchased there should be a discount   utc sc said great bottle and all bottle should have a way to track like this so im an og backer as we like to say since i backed this way back in kickstarter days the first bottle was an amazing thing to carry around with and when it would glow and people ask what is going on with your bottle  had a few problems which you can understand being the first and customers service was a tad bit rough in the beings as well glad to say the version  of bottle fixed almost all the problems the first one had and customer service has improved they just updated the app which fixed allot of the problems we had with that but still needs improving things still needed for the app to integrate with more apps misfit lostit myfitnesspal these are some that just need to be within any health app thank you for the hard work your doing to bring us the best water bottle on the market today and please keep up the work to improve the software experience which i think is the main focus should be on for awhile   utc amanda w said first product effective in getting me to drink water this thing is great had it about a week and it has helped me get my rear in gear to drink water more regularly love the feel of the bottle it fits in my cup holder in my car nice color and works great with the app and my apple health definitely recommend it   utc rachel towns said love my bottle i ordered the teal it took a while to come in due to demand but hidrate spark constantly communicated via emails about the status i never felt like i wouldnt get it i love it you can change the settings to fit you best and the notifications are cool definitely recommend   utc leslie said love this bottle i work as a dispatcher  it is very way for me to forget to drink water especially when im at work i am in love with this bottle   utc deb said works great and its tough i waited many weeks before writing this review i thought i drank a lot of water but now i know otherwise this bottle works like a charm and is very well made today i accidentally knocked it off my kitchen table onto a ceramic tile floor the stem got dislodged i was mortified put it back in and it is working fine and not a crack or dent in the bottle after that rough tumble love that it syncs with the fibit app   utc gpooh said amazing i absolutely love this product i purchased my hidrate buddy a few months ago when i received it two days ago i was so elated it took a little while to realized the batteries installed were just to show you how to place the additional batteries in now i understand why i was having migraine and muscle spasms ill give it a couple of months before another review thanks hidrate i think ill buy a second bottle just in case by daughter snags it   utc swatanter said a must have i bought mine and absolutely love it best investment ever the reminders are so cute and i cant tell u how much im glad i spent the money i told all my friends about it and they are thinking about joining me in my quest to become healthier one sip at a time   utc shayla said great bottle  company i love this bottle this is exactly what i needed to get me to drink more water and it works i went from drinking  to at least  cups a day which is a big deal for me im continuing my goal to drink more i love how it lights up and how it syncs to my fitbit also this company is really thoughtful they were having issues with bottles being shipped with half powered batteries so they started shipping batteries along with the bottles and then when i was having issues with my bottle they spent a few days helping me out to fix it just shows how thoughtful they are and how they want to do right by the customer you wont regret buying this bottle    utc daniel ramos said amazing customer service omg so the background is that my girlfriend and i celebrate our anniversary on a monthly basis cheesy i know but we find it helps us grow in our relationship and reaffirm our love for each other this month i bought her a hidrate water bottle to celebrate us being together  months i knew she was wanting a smart water bottle and after several hours of research i decided to purchase her a hidrate water bottle it was going to be perfect and in the color she loves well i thought hey purchase this a week in advance and it should be no problem right i didnt realize how popular this magnificent bottle was and saw that it could potentially be a long time before i received the bottlewell after a couple days of not receiving an email stating it had shipped i decided to take matters into my own hands and reach out to the company to maybe get the water bottle delivered by our anniversary after only a few hours i received an email stating they would try hard to get it shipped out asap but couldnt make any guarantees i honestly doubted the company would honor my request but low and behold i received the best email the next day that it had been shipped omg i constantly checked the tracking number and the next day the tracking information said the expected delivery was going to be on our anniversary well it was delivered to my place in time and i actually met the postman at my mailbox because i was so eager to receive it lol i cant say it enough hidrate thank you for making this possible and you truly take care of your customers   utc liz said worth the wait i just received my bottle today and am already obsessed it is worth the wait syncs very fast with the app and motivates me to drink more often great product    utc tara said love my hidrate spark i debated for a few months before i finally bought my bottle after reading reviews and researching the product i finally decided to get one i am so happy i did this is the best water bottle ever i did have to wait a few weeks for shipping but it was well worth the wait i chose the purple bottle and i was worried i wouldnt see the flashing reminders very well through the dark bottle but you can see them just fine i like to drink my water through a stray but the opening on this bottle works for me and i dont miss my straw at all the texture of the bottle is awesome and has gotten the attention of many people who see me with it the finger strap is something i really like too it makes it super easy to carry the bottle when my hands are full its very easy to set up and clean the bottle as well as change the batteries the app is great easy to use and pleasing to the eye i love how it syncs with my fitbit and adjusts my water needs based on my activity the push reminders are the best i even take screen shots and share them with friends i have had a few connectivity issues but they seem to work themselves out i have also had to contact customer service and got quick responses i highly recommend this bottle its amazing   utc donald said awesome i bought these a few months agobut got sick and never got to use them feeling better i just connected it to my iphone which literally took secondsthe app is absolutely amazing the bottle fits

about it today and as soon as i had time i came home and ordered it i think this can really help me i have lost  pounds so far and i am the worst with remembering to drink water i am very excited to

what i thought and now feel noticeably better because i am getting the proper amount of water not only is the bottle amazing but the customer service is more like  stars i emailed about a shipping location change because i was moving and instead of changing the location they said they will send it out immediately and will rush it to my address before i move fast forward two months and my boyfriend knocks it off the counter and breaks the lid ugh men and i emailed asking if i could purchase just a replacement lid and they said that because they didnt want my boyfriend to be in the doghouse forever they would send me a free lid how fricken awesome customer service like this is hard to find nowadays great company great product   utc kristy y said love it i know that i never drank

cant even drink my coffee because i am dying of thirst i am so thankful that customer service is so wonderful in helping me get my hidrate back together quickly after an accident their response time is excellent much quicker than my own i cant wait to get it back together again so that i can get back on track because im still not completing my goal but im doing better over each week that passes i do wish i could add my intake for days past because i have forgotten my bottle once or twice at work and didnt remember til the next day that i needed to add my intake otherwise love it im so thirsty without its glowing goodness to remind me   utc alex k said i would marry this bottle i love this bottle its smart funny beautiful instagrammable and nice to hold basically the perfect partner everyone who sees this bottle it really catches the eye when it starts blinking when reminding me to drink wants one at least  people in the past  weeks have bought this bottle after seeing mine wheres my referral bonus   utc crystal c said weird to love this so much i really love my new water bottle so easy to setup works great and just makes me happy it really is very nicely designed the feel of it is awesome and just so nice the push notifications are awesome makes me smile instead of it being so official to drink water keep it up next idea put in a carbon stick to purify    utc kathy said love it❤❤❤ once i got it working it works amazing turns out ive been drinking the right amount of water  i also love the real color will possibly get another one just different color  teal   utc nichole m said awesome this bottle is as awesome as the company it comes from i have had nothing but great interactions with them   utc michelle said love i just love all the little notifications they make me laugh   utc brian derrow said the choice is clear fantastic product simply put this is the best water bottle i have ever owned it magnificently blends form  function from its intelligent electronics the feel of it in your hands ease of cleaning to the easy to use data driven app on my smartphone well done to hidrate awesome iot device keep up the great work   utc michelle said keeps me on track i had no idea how little water i was drinking this bottle and app keep me in track i take it everywhere with me being a nurse its hard to stay hydrated during your shifts but this helps me stay on track so im not so thirsty at the end of the day i love that it know how much water i need and changes based on activity and location it also helps me not to overeat sometimes i feel hungry when i really just need water   utc anne w said love my bottles  great for family competitions love the bottles and customer service is bar none hot pink and white are the colors my husband and i are competing at times to see who is actually drinking more water nice feature my only issue is that the app does not link to myfitness pal to track the water the only feature it may use is the steps counter which i am already wearing a garmin vivofit hr for that the only issue i see in the future is removing the sensor stick as mine came preassembled to the lid im not sure i can get it off to switch to the new lid the only other odd thing is the glow is happening after or before notifications to drink perhaps on the next version  a stronger fill line indication  its very hard to spot on my colored bottle  maybe a dark black and have the line thickness on the plastic all the way around the bottle   utc patty watkins said love it just started using this three days ago but i love it it helps me keep track of my water and i find myself drinking more than my daily allowance is set at would highly recommend it ❤   utc meg said great with one exception i love my hydrate spark bottle my only complaint is with the app there is no way to adjust the water intake once it rolls to the next day for example i forgot my bottle at home the other day and did not add my intake now that it has rolled to the next day it will forever be a  for that day and ruin my stats it would be a really simple fix to let you go back and adjust   utc thomas said innovative and fashionable i workout daily and i generally carry a gallon jug around at the office  i always feel weird carrying a jug around like some tool ooh look at me i have a gallon of water this bottle is fashionable in that its sleek and i love its tracking capability and integration with my apple watch the reminder notifications are hilarious as well whoever wrote the content for them is witty and when the bottle sends you a reminder you will generally laugh out loud  i do wish i could have more than just the red and white glow notification in the bottle but apparently that is still being developed  this is a must have    utc chris williams said love this bottle i purchased this bottle in hopes that it would help me keep track of the water that i drank each day this bottle is truly amazing and i love this bottle i highly recommend purchasing this bottle   utc dawn said love it feels like a gameat least to me try to get my water in before the bottle blinks or sends a reminder to my apple ⌚️ or  when i hit the goal that i set love watching the fireworks   utc alexa torres said love this bottle i bought this bottle for my mom and she absolutely loves it she loves the app too the only recommendations she has are that she thinks the bottle should have another small hole above the drinking hole in order to be able to drink more at once kind of like how coffee cup covers are and also on the app being able to take water intake away she said she spilled it one day and it records that thats the amount you drank i know youre able to add more water but she feels you should be able to take some away too cant wait to get one for myself   utc rosanna said fun with friends i am really enjoying this water bottle the best feature is that you can follow your friends i bought one for myself and my best friend she and i keep track of each others progress and encourage each other to drink more ive used another water tracking bottle but i prefer hidrate spark for a couple reasons one being the ability to

makes sure that you will never lose your water bottle again with this feature you will get a reminder and location to where the bottle was last seen if you left your water bottle somewhere for an extended period of timewe raised k so its happening were young entrepreneurs who are passionate about design community and the small things in life that help us all feel better we all met at the university of minnesota in the start up capital of the north our team includes left to right alexander ham hambrock coleman iverson nadya nguyen daniel worku and alexandra feeken were a team of engineers designers marketers and developers  in september  our ceo nadya pulled together a team of fellow university of minnesota students for the google startup weekend in minneapolis minnesota to build the first smart water bottle prototype in just  hours we built a water bottle that tracked water intake and synced to a mobile app on a smartphone we won third place and people began asking when the water bottles would be available for purchase that’s the moment we knew they were on to something the team worked evenings and weekends for  months before being accepted into the sprint mobile health accelerator powered by techstars  we quit our jobs and left everything behind to work on a product that we believed in the program is a  monthlong intensive onsite experience in kansas city mo in which  mobilehealth companies selected from around the world receive funding and mentorship to accelerate their businesses we reiterated multiple bottle designs before deciding to go with the final hidrate me the lid was another challenge in itself and we d printed and tested several before finalizing our design        risks and challenges manufacturing the bottle many small companies face difficulties when it comes to manufacturing new products from design problems to unexpected costs thats why weve made it a priority from the very beginning to involve manufacturers every step of the way catching issues before they had a chance to become problems members of our team have seen multiple products through from concept to manufacturing shipping in winter  we plan to place the manufacturing order by the end of june  well be reviewing samples in august and september december of   january  is our shipping estimate when we account for both making revisions and getting the first shipment in from the factory battery life our testing shows that the included battery will power the hidrate me bottle for well over a year we are still doing additional testing and tweaking to make sure that the battery life will be at least a year learn about accountability on kickstarter questions about this project check out the faq report this project to kickstarter support this project
