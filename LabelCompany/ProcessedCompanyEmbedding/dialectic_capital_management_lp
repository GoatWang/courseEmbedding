resolution to reconstitute the board in a manner that is in the best interests of all shareholders news provided by dialectic capital management lp jun    et share this article norwalk conn june   prnewswire  dialectic capital management lp together with its affiliates dialectic one of the largest shareholders of covisint corporation covisint or the company nasdaq covs with beneficial ownership of approximately  of the outstanding common stock of the company today announced that it has delivered a letter to the companys board of directors the board the full text of which is included below  dialectic also announced that it has nominated a slate of five highly qualified candidates for election to the board at the companys  annual meeting of shareholders the full text of the letter to the board follows  june   covisint corporation   evergreen rd suite   southfield michigan   attn board of directors dear members of the board dialectic capital management lp together with its affiliates dialectic currently owns approximately  of the outstanding common stock of covisint corporation covisint or the company making us one of the companys largest shareholders we initially invested in the company over a year ago because we were encouraged by the new management teams vision to turn around covisint which included a twopart plan to grow the company  unfortunately by the end of  management not only missed its own targets and timeline for growth but failed to disclose its previously promised plan b for the operating business if the company missed its  targets plan b after numerous delays management finally stated that it would announce plan b on the q conference call which it delayed until june   days after the deadline for nominating director candidates for election to the board of directors of the company the board at the  annual meeting of shareholders the  annual meeting we have serious concerns with covisints strategic direction recent performance and delayed plan b under the direction of its current management team and board  we therefore believe change is needed on the board to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to implement a clear strategy for the benefit of all covisint shareholders  we tried to engage constructively with members of the management team to reach an amicable resolution to reconstitute the board and avoid a proxy contest but to no avail to that end last week we nominated a slate of five highly qualified director candidates for election at the  annual meeting including scott daniels alan b howe john fichthorn john mutch and edward rose managements failed strategy as noted above we initially invested in the company in light of the new management teams twopart plan to turnaround the company which was clearly laid out to shareholders  the first part of the plan was focused on growing the company with a target of  million in revenue and a willingness to burn cash down to  million if necessary by the end of  if that plan was not achieved management promised shareholders an alternative plan to meet its strategic objectives which involved a return to profits and the consideration of a potential sale of the company by the end of  despite having  million in cash none of the revenue and profit targets originally outlined by covisint management had been met notably on the q earnings call not only did management fail to describe plan b but it refused to answer our questions or our subsequent calls apparently only accepting inquiries from sellside analysts  when management finally returned our calls two weeks later we reiterated our desire to understand plan b and management noted that it would be disclosed on the q earnings call which was conveniently delayed until june   nine days after the nomination deadline for the  annual meeting  we were therefore left with no choice but to submit a formal nomination of director candidates for election at the  annual meeting  we believe other shareholders are likewise frustrated with managements inability to communicate a clear strategy for the company both roumell asset management llc roumell and vector capital iv lp vector have filed schedule ds with respect to their investments in covisint and have outlined their concerns with the companys strategic direction specifically roumell has requested that the company appoint two independent directors and explore strategic alternatives while vector has determined that the board should undertake a strategic review process to sell the company we attempted to engage constructively with the company on multiple occasions to discuss our concerns regarding managements lack of a strategic plan as well as the concerns and requests publicized by the companys other large shareholders we also attempted to reach an amicable resolution with the company to avoid a proxy contest which included a proposal that the company undertake a process to replace two existing board members with two independent companyselected directors no later than september   despite our sincere efforts to reach a resolution covisint failed to respond to our proposed settlement until the eleventh hour just before the nomination deadline for the  annual meeting only to inform us that the company had rejected our proposed resolution we believe management purposefully delayed its response to our proposal in an attempt to thwart our lawful nomination which only solidifies our belief that change is desperately needed on the board dialectics solution in order to address managements failed strategy and apparent inability to communicate a clear strategy for the company moving forward we believe the board must be reconstituted with directors that will bring a fresh perspective and shareholderoriented mindset to the board  it is time for accountability at covisint  we have therefore nominated five highly qualified director candidates for election at the  annual meeting who we believe have the requisite skill sets and relevant business and financial experience to ensure that the company evaluates with an open mind and a keen sense of urgency all alternative strategies to determine the best path forward to maximize value for all shareholders  it is unfortunate – but not surprising given the companys apparent inability to communicate clearly with its shareholders – that covisint has chosen to waste additional shareholder resources on a proxy contest rather than work constructively with some of its largest shareholders to implement meaningful change at the company we are open to continuing our discussions with covisint regarding board composition and corporate strategy and remain amenable to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution that is in the best interests of all shareholders however if an agreement is not reached we are fully prepared to solicit the support of our fellow shareholders to elect our highly qualified director candidates at the  annual meeting sincerely           john
