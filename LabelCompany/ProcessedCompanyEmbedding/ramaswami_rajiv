them to stick with stem and give them a handson lesson in code students get to build and program a raspberry pi navigate a lifesized maze and investigate historic methods of computer programming each projectbased learning activity is guided by industry experts some from broadcom rajiv emphasized that students can become creators of technology not just consumers he spoke about growing up in india his childhood fascination with the trains that his father designed and built and how his curiosity drove him to study engineering “science explains the world around you and engineering is when you put that science to work” he said rajiv went into engineering to figure out “how things work”  today at broadcom he explained how its technology is everywhere “we build chips that connect things together” he said “your computer phone the internet – how you get your information as an engineer you can change the world it’s one of the most satisfying careers you can have” watch rajiv’s full presentation

vsphere environments in the private cloud that continues to be the biggest market opportunity for ussneha jha    etcio    may 0 0 0 ist newsletter a a in an interview with etciocom rajiv ramaswami coo products and services vmware lays down the vision behind vmware’s product portfolioyou mentioned earlier that every major initiative at vmware right now has your cross cloud architecture nsx as a part of it so what are the three primary use cases for nsx in the market as far as the roadmap for nsx is concerned what can we expect this yearthe three primary use cases are automation microsegmentation or security and application continuity disaster recovery roughly i would say 0 is automation 0 is microsegmentation and then the rest is disaster recovery application continuity we are also seeing that customers start with one use case but then potentially add other use cases over time because it is the same software and they can they can start doing more typically automation is with some of the larger customers who have bigger infrastructures that they need to fully automate security can go from very small deployments to very large deployments and disaster recovery once you have two datacenters in play so those are the three use cases that we see for network virtualizationas far as the roadmap for nsx is concerned what can we expect this yearso we started out with nsx primarily deployed in vsphere environments in the private cloud that continues to be the biggest market opportunity for us this year what you will see coming out from us we are extending nsx into the public cloud what that means is that you will start seeing nsx now running along with our vmware cloud foundation on aws wherever our vmware cloud foundation stack is run in the cloud you will also see nsx natively available on aws this year so when customers do cloud native applications on aws they can secure that and automate that with nsx the other thing that you will see is the ability to extend virtual networking into containers the third thing is that we are continuing to enhance the capabilities and features of nsx the platform itself more security features more network services features etc so think about it in three vectors public cloud containers and more network services and continuing to enhance featurescan you give me a user reference example to show how it works for organizations using itthere are many public references we can count on let me pick on a few here so let us take an insurance company an insurance company is based on fundamentally the notion of trust customers trust them because customers are paying them buying policies and some day this policy needs to get paid out when you are in that business of trust data integrity and privacy become paramount if you are an insurance company and you get hacked and your customer data gets released that is a make or break you lose the trust that you have with your customers so security is top of mind for them we have many insurance companies that have implemented microsegmentation in a proactive way inside their datacenters today mostly all private cloud datacenters today to secure that infrastructure that is a very strong use case we have seen lots of deploymentstoday we have over  customers and we have deployments continuing to accelerate and the business has been growing we announced at the end of last quarter that we are on a  billion  run rate another example particularly with large scale companies like citibank for example is automation citibank has these hundreds of thousands of vms and for them to automate deployment of their private cloud they need to automate all the network services and doing that with the physical network is almost next to impossible so they have implemented nsx in a very broad basis one of the largest deployments we have to help them automate they are also now with us on a journey to the public cloud citibank looks at what they do in the public cloud they would like to use the nsx capabilities that we are bringing out potentially to secure they would like to think about using vmware cloud on aws etc so that is just a couple of different exampleswe have other companies that have disaster recovery scenarios these are smaller companies maybe they have two datacenters and what they are able to do with nsx is okay now i can run these two datacenters in activeactive mode and stretch the network across and make those two datacenters look like one logical datacenter think of them as one pool of resources things can be moved flexibly back and forth across these datacenters and yes if one datacenter fails then the other datacenter picks uphow do you play in the hyperconverged datacenter marketwe believe we are the number one in hyperconverged as of the end of last quarter we had 0 plus customers we were on a  million  annual run rate and keep in mind that is a pure software business when our competitors talk about hyperconverged they think about it as a combined softwarehardware appliance business typically the hardware component of it is four to five times the software if you are  million  equivalent run rate could represent something like a billion and a half revenue if you include hardware bundled in but we are a pure software companyso in hyperconverged the product is called vsan and it is built into vsphere which is our server virtualization platform that provides two advantages first is we do run in the kernel we get higher performance than our competition which allows us in turn to run more vms per host which delivers better tco you need fewer servers to run the same workloads that is number one second if you look at hyperconverged lot of people buying hyperconverged are actually looking at it in the context of servers when they do a server refresh they look at buying hyperconverged because from a hardware perspective it is the servers bundled with either ssds or as traditional disks so in that mindset if you are a vsphere admin you are operating vsan in a natural extension it is exactly the same tools that you used to manage your vmware environment that you then use to manage vsan that is number two third we provide a very flexible way for customers to consume hyperconverged lots of choices if you want to buy a traditional appliance you can buy that through dell today we have an appliance called vxrail which includes vsan coupled with dell hardware all bundled preengineered as a solution that is available today but we also sell vsan as pure software and in fact if you look at what is going to happen over time and if you look at the model that has happened in vsphere initially a lot of vsphere was sold bundled with hardware but if you look at what has happened to vsphere today people are very comfortable buying vsphere as software and they run it on all kinds of hardware and we support any does not matter what hardware it is dell server hp server lenovo server quanta server does not matter in much the same way with vsan we have the most flexible software offering customers can buy the vsan software from us once you buy vsphere you can add on a vsan license if you like and you can run it on a whole range of underlying hardware we support a range of different options we provide a lot of flexibility in terms of how customers can consume hyperconverged not just restricting to an appliancewhat do you think of the web scale it and datacenters how do you think organizations should rebuild their datacenters in this era of cloud and digital transformationin a nutshell you consolidate you virtualize your full datacenter including compute storage networking and then you add cloud management and automation for both operations as well as blue printing and provision and if enterprises do that it allows them to build a web scale right datacenter with a full private cloud consumption model that looks much like a public cloudhow does vmware view india as a market where do you see the opportunities lyingindia is a strategic emerging market for us we see a lot of opportunities both in terms of what you are doing basics as well as new technology adoption we still see a lot of customers in india who have not fully virtualized particularly virtualization is relatively low today i was talking to a large public sector company that is barely virtualized so just taking our customers on that step of the journey in terms of basic cycle of consolidate virtualize automate and driving that is one anglebut at the same time we have customers who are doing full scale large scale digital transformations like sbi and bharti airtel so these are large customers that are engaged much further along in their journey in terms of transforming them so we see both kind of what i would say blocking and attacking small scale getting our customers on this journey start pushing them on one side to very large transformational opportunities like what i just described so we see the entire range of solutions that we talked about being applicable to the indian market it is just that different customers are at different stages in their journey related like madonna a cio has to
