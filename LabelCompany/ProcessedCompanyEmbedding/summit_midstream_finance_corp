reported a net loss of  million for the first quarter of  compared to a net loss of  million for the prioryear period  net cash provided by operations totaled  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in the prioryear period  adjusted ebitda totaled  million and distributable cash flow totaled  million for the first quarter of  compared to  million and  million respectively for

prioryear period and a decrease of  compared to  mbbld in the fourth quarter of   smlps natural gas volume throughput metrics exclude its proportionate share of volume throughput from its  ownership interest in ohio gathering steve newby president and chief executive officer commented smlps first quarter  financial and operating results correspond with our expectations and full year  financial guidance  over the last several months drilling activity has increased significantly across our systems  we expect volume growth from this drilling activity to positively impact our operating and financial results in the second half of the year we took advantage of a favorable capital markets environment in the first quarter of  by accessing the bond market for  million of senior notes at a  coupon  this opportunistic financing enabled us to repay all of the outstanding debt under our  senior notes extend our debt maturity profile and term out  million of revolver borrowings  we continue to have a positive outlook on our business and we believe well see growth accelerate as we move throughout the year  our customers are increasing their drilling and completion activity behind our systems and many have taken steps to strengthen their balance sheets and enhance their capital position to execute their growth plans  in addition we are encouraged by the level of commercial activity we are seeing and we are evaluating a number of opportunities around our existing system footprints and in new basins  financial guidance smlp is reaffirming its  financial guidance with adjusted ebitda expected to range from  million to  million and an annualized fourth quarter  adjusted ebitda run rate between  million and  million  smlp expects to incur  million to  million of capex in

gathering average daily throughput mmcfd     exclusive of volume throughput for ohio gathering  gross basis represents  of volume throughput for ohio gathering based on a onemonth lag utica shale the utica shale reportable segment includes our  ownership interest in ohio gathering a natural gas gathering system in service and under development spanning the condensate liquidsrich and dry gas windows of the utica shale in harrison guernsey noble belmont and monroe counties in southeastern ohio  segment adjusted ebitda for the utica shale includes our proportional share of adjusted ebitda from ohio gathering based on a onemonth lag  the utica shale reportable segment also includes summit utica the natural gas gathering system we operate which is currently in service and under development in belmont and monroe counties in southeastern ohio  summit utica gathers and delivers dry natural gas to interconnections with a thirdparty intrastate pipeline which provides access to the clarington hub  segment adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  totaled  million up  from  million for the prioryear period primarily due to significantly higher volume throughput across summit utica partially offset by lower volume throughput on ohio gathering and lower stabilization revenue at ohio condensate  volume throughput on the ohio gathering system which is based on a onemonth lag averaged  mmcfd gross in the first quarter of  compared to  mmcfd gross in the prioryear period and  mmcfd gross in the fourth quarter of   volume throughput on ohio gathering in the first quarter of  was impacted by natural declines from existing wells on the system  ohio gathering commissioned the larew compressor station in march  which is expected to facilitate incremental dry gas production beginning in the second quarter of  and generates an incremental compression fee on all dry gas volumes  currently our customers are running five drilling rigs across the ohio gathering footprint and we expect to see the volume benefit from this activity beginning in the second half of   volume throughput on the summit utica system averaged  mmcfd in the first quarter of  compared to  mmcfd in the prioryear period and  mmcfd in the fourth quarter of   volume throughput for the first quarter of  increased relative to the prioryear period due to our continued buildout of the summit utica gathering system and our connection of  new wells throughout  and another four new wells during the first quarter of   we expect volumes on summit utica will continue to grow throughout the balance of the year as new wells located on new and existing pad sites are completed  in april  we commissioned a new project to offload capacity constrained natural gas from a thirdparty gathering system adjacent to the summit utica system  we expect this project to significantly increase volumes on summit utica beginning in the second quarter of  albeit at a lower gathering rate given that we are providing highpressure gathering and compression services and not lowpressure wellhead gathering services williston basin the bison midstream polar and divide and tioga midstream systems provide our midstream services for the williston basin reportable segment  bison midstream gathers associated natural gas production in mountrail and burke counties in north dakota and delivers to thirdparty pipelines serving a thirdparty processing plant in channahon illinois  the polar and divide system gathers crude oil production in williams and divide counties in north dakota and delivers to the colt and basin transload rail terminals as well as other thirdparty intra and interstate pipelines  the polar and divide system also gathers and delivers produced water to various thirdparty disposal wells in the region  tioga midstream is a crude oil produced water and associated natural gas gathering system in williams county north dakota  all crude oil and natural gas gathered on the tioga midstream system is delivered to thirdparty pipelines and all produced water is delivered to thirdparty disposal wells segment adjusted ebitda for the williston basin segment totaled  million for the first quarter of  compared to  million for the prioryear period  compared to the prioryear period first quarter  volumes were negatively impacted due to a minimal number of new wells being commissioned behind our gathering systems during the first quarter of   in addition to lower volumes a certain williston customer has gathering rates that reset up or down annually based on actual volumes delivered relative to a predetermined schedule  the higher gathering rates that we enjoyed for this particular customer in the first quarter of  were lowered in the second half of  and impacted our sequential quarterly and yearoveryear comparisons for this segment  without any new drilling activity in  we would expect to see gathering rates for this particular customer to reset higher in   the williston basin segment benefitted from the recognition of  million in the first quarter of  related to the settlement of a business interruption insurance claim associated with the temporary suspension of produced water gathering activities in      liquids volumes averaged  mbbld in the first quarter of  a decrease of  over the prioryear period and a decrease of  compared to the fourth quarter of   lower liquids volumes were primarily related to natural declines from existing wells on the polar and divide system as no new wells were commissioned during the quarter  certain of our customers remain active across the polar and divide system with three drilling rigs currently working and adding to an existing backlog of more than  drilled uncompleted wells ducs currently behind our williston gathering systems  we expect many of these ducs to begin to be commissioned over the next several months following the startup of new thirdparty longhaul takeaway pipeline associated natural gas volumes averaged  mmcfd in the first quarter of  a decrease of  over the prioryear period and flat compared to the fourth quarter of   volume declines were primarily related to natural declines from existing wells on the bison midstream and tioga midstream systems as only three new wells were connected during the quarter  in addition the severe winter weather experienced late in the fourth quarter of  continued into the beginning of  and negatively impacted volumes during the quarter relative to the prioryear period      piceancedj basins the grand river and the niobrara gp systems provide our midstream services for the piceancedj basins reportable segment  these systems provide natural gas gathering and processing services for producers operating in the piceance basin located in western colorado and eastern utah and in the denverjulesburg dj basin located in northeastern colorado   segment adjusted ebitda totaled  million for the first quarter of  an increase of  from  million for the prioryear period  first quarter  volume throughput averaged  mmcfd an increase of  from  mmcfd in the prioryear period and flat with the fourth quarter of   volume growth relative to the prioryear period was primarily due to ongoing drilling and completion activity from our singlebasin focused private equitybacked customers  these customers commissioned dozens of new wells across our piceance and dj basin gathering systems in  and in the first quarter of  these customers commissioned another  new wells  this activity was partially offset by the impact of our anchor customers continued suspension of drilling activities in the basin and the resulting natural declines from existing production  this impact of our anchor customers volume declines was partially offset by higher minimum volume commitment mvc shortfall payment adjustments associated with our gas gathering agreements  certain of our customers remain active across our piceance and dj gathering systems with three drilling rigs currently working barnett shale the dfw midstream system provides our midstream services for the barnett shale reportable segment  this system gathers and delivers lowpressure natural gas received from pad sites primarily located in southeastern tarrant county texas to downstream intrastate pipelines serving various natural gas hubs in the region  segment adjusted ebitda for the barnett shale segment totaled  million for the first quarter of  a decrease of  from the prioryear period  volume throughput of  mmcfd in the first quarter of  was down  compared to the prioryear period average of  mmcfd and flat with the fourth quarter of   no new wells were commissioned behind the dfw gathering system in the first quarter of  but drilling activity behind the system has recently increased with two rigs added to the field since the end of the first quarter of  and workover rigs returning several dormant wells to service late in the first quarter of   this increased level of activity is largely due to the customer turnover weve experienced behind the system in the last several quarters and we expect that it will lead to increasing volumes in the second half of  marcellus shale the mountaineer midstream system provides our midstream services for the marcellus shale reportable segment this system gathers highpressure natural gas received from upstream pipeline interconnections with antero midstream partners lp and crestwood equity partners lp  natural gas on the mountaineer midstream system is delivered to the sherwood processing complex located in doddridge county west virginia  segment adjusted ebitda for the marcellus shale segment totaled  million for the first quarter of  an increase of  from  million for the prioryear period primarily due to  million of rightofway repair expenses incurred in the prioryear period  volume throughput for this segment averaged  mmcfd in the first quarter of  a decrease of  from  mmcfd in the prioryear period and an increase of  from the  mmcfd in the fourth quarter of   volume throughput increased relative to the fourth quarter of  as a result of our customer commissioning new wells behind our system  we expect our customer to continue to complete its inventory of ducs behind the mountaineer midstream system throughout the balance of the year which we expect will drive volumes higher particularly in the second half of   mvc shortfall payments smlp billed its customers  million in the first quarter of  related to mvcs  for those customers that do not have credit banking mechanisms in their gathering agreements or do not have the ability to use mvc shortfall payments as credits the mvc shortfall payments are accounted for as gathering revenue in the period that they are earned  for the first quarter of  smlp recognized  million of gathering revenue associated with mvc shortfall payments from certain customers in the marcellus shale piceancedj basins williston basin and barnett shale reportable segments  of this amount  million was related to a certain williston basin customer with whom we entered into a gathering agreement amendment during the first quarter of   pursuant to the amendment the customer forfeited its mvc credit bank which had been recorded on smlps balance sheet in prior periods as deferred revenue  mvc shortfall payment adjustments in the first quarter of  totaled  million and included  million of deferred revenue related to mvc shortfall payments and  million related to mvc shortfall payment adjustments from certain

our financial statements such as investors commercial banks research analysts and others adjusted ebitda is used to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make cash distributions and support our indebtedness the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basis our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other entities in the midstream energy sector without regard to financing or capital structure the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities and the financial performance of our assets without regard to i income or loss from equity method investees ii the impact of the timing of minimum volume commitments shortfall payments under our gathering agreements or iii the timing of impairments or other noncash income or expense items distributable cash flow is used to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make future cash distributions and the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities both of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap for example certain items excluded from adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are significant components in understanding and assessing an entitys financial performance such as an entitys cost of capital and tax structure adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs and although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements we compensate for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap financial measures understanding the differences between the financial measures and incorporating these data points into our decisionmaking process reconciliations of gaap to nongaap financial measures are attached to this press release we do not provide the gaap financial measures

liquidsrich and dry gas windows of the utica shale in harrison guernsey noble belmont and monroe counties in southeastern ohio  segment adjusted ebitda for the utica shale includes our proportional share of adjusted ebitda from ohio gathering based on a onemonth lag  the utica shale reportable segment also includes summit utica the natural gas gathering system we operate which is currently in service and under development in belmont and monroe counties in southeastern ohio  summit utica gathers and delivers dry natural gas to interconnections with a thirdparty intrastate pipeline which provides access to the clarington hub segment adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  totaled  million up  from  million for the prioryear period primarily due to significantly higher volume throughput across summit utica partially offset by lower volume throughput on ohio gathering and lower stabilization revenue at ohio condensate  volume throughput on the ohio gathering system which is based on a onemonth lag averaged  mmcfd gross in the first quarter of  compared to  mmcfd gross in the prioryear period and  mmcfd gross in the fourth quarter of   volume throughput on ohio gathering in the first quarter of  was impacted by natural declines from existing wells on the system ohio gathering commissioned the larew compressor station in march  which is expected to facilitate incremental dry gas production beginning in the second quarter of  and generates an incremental compression fee on all dry gas volumes  currently our customers are running five drilling rigs across the ohio gathering footprint and we expect to see the volume benefit from this activity beginning in the second half of  volume throughput on the summit utica system averaged  mmcfd in the first quarter of  compared to  mmcfd in the prioryear period and  mmcfd in the fourth quarter of   volume throughput for the first quarter of  increased relative to the prioryear period due to our continued buildout of the summit utica gathering system and our connection of  new wells throughout  and another four new wells during the first quarter of   we expect volumes on summit utica will continue to grow throughout the balance of the year as new wells located on new and existing pad sites are completed in april  we commissioned a new project to offload capacity constrained natural gas from a thirdparty gathering system adjacent to the summit utica system  we expect this project to significantly increase volumes on summit utica beginning in the second quarter of  albeit at a lower gathering rate given that we are providing highpressure gathering and compression services and not lowpressure wellhead gathering serviceswilliston basinthe bison midstream polar and divide and tioga midstream systems provide our midstream services for the williston basin reportable segment  bison midstream gathers associated natural gas production in mountrail and burke counties in north dakota and delivers to thirdparty pipelines serving a thirdparty processing plant in channahon illinois  the polar and divide system gathers crude oil production in williams and divide counties in north dakota and delivers to the colt and basin transload rail terminals as well as other thirdparty intra and interstate pipelines  the polar and divide system also gathers and delivers produced water to various thirdparty disposal wells in the region  tioga midstream is a crude oil produced water and associated natural gas gathering system in williams county north dakota  all crude oil and natural gas gathered on the tioga midstream system is delivered to thirdparty pipelines and all produced water is delivered to thirdparty disposal wellssegment adjusted ebitda for the williston basin segment totaled  million for the first quarter of  compared to  million for the prioryear period  compared to the prioryear period first quarter  volumes were negatively impacted due to a minimal number of new wells being commissioned behind our gathering systems during the first quarter of   in addition to lower volumes a certain williston customer has gathering rates that reset up or down annually based on actual volumes delivered relative to a predetermined schedule  the higher gathering rates that we enjoyed for this particular customer in the first quarter of  were lowered in the second half of  and impacted our sequential quarterly and yearoveryear comparisons for this segment  without any new drilling activity in  we would expect to see gathering rates for this particular customer to reset higher in   the williston basin segment benefitted from the recognition of  million in the first quarter of  related to the settlement of a business interruption insurance claim associated with the temporary suspension of produced water gathering activities in     liquids volumes averaged  mbbld in the first quarter of  a decrease of  over the prioryear period and a decrease of  compared to the fourth quarter of   lower liquids volumes were primarily related to natural declines from existing wells on the polar and divide system as no new wells were commissioned during the quarter  certain of our customers remain active across the polar and divide system with three drilling rigs currently working and adding to an existing backlog of more than  drilled uncompleted wells ducs currently behind our williston gathering systems  we expect many of these ducs to begin to be commissioned over the next several months following the startup of new thirdparty longhaul takeaway pipelineassociated natural gas volumes averaged  mmcfd in the first quarter of  a decrease of  over the prioryear period and flat compared to the fourth quarter of   volume declines were primarily related to natural declines from existing wells on the bison midstream and tioga midstream systems as only three new wells were connected during the quarter  in addition the severe winter weather experienced late in the fourth quarter of  continued into the beginning of  and negatively impacted volumes during the quarter relative to the prioryear period     piceancedj basinsthe grand river and the niobrara gp systems provide our midstream services for the piceancedj basins reportable segment  these systems provide natural gas gathering and processing services for producers operating in the piceance basin located in western colorado and eastern utah and in the denverjulesburg dj basin located in northeastern colorado  segment adjusted ebitda totaled  million for the first quarter of  an increase of  from  million for the prioryear period  first quarter  volume throughput averaged  mmcfd an increase of  from  mmcfd in the prioryear period and flat with the fourth quarter of   volume growth relative to the prioryear period was primarily due to ongoing drilling and completion activity from our singlebasin focused private equitybacked customers  these customers commissioned dozens of new wells across our piceance and dj basin gathering systems in  and in the first quarter of  these customers commissioned another  new wells  this activity was partially offset by the impact of our anchor customers continued suspension of drilling activities in the basin and the resulting natural declines from existing production  this impact of our anchor customers volume declines was partially offset by higher minimum volume commitment mvc shortfall payment adjustments associated with our gas gathering agreements  certain of our customers remain active across our piceance and dj gathering systems with three drilling rigs currently workingbarnett shalethe dfw midstream system provides our midstream services for the barnett shale reportable segment  this system gathers and delivers lowpressure natural gas received from pad sites primarily located in southeastern tarrant county texas to downstream intrastate pipelines serving various natural gas hubs in the region segment adjusted ebitda for the barnett shale segment totaled  million for the first quarter of  a decrease of  from the prioryear period  volume throughput of  mmcfd in the first quarter of  was down  compared to the prioryear period average of  mmcfd and flat with the fourth quarter of   no new wells were commissioned behind the dfw gathering system in the first quarter of  but drilling activity behind the system has recently increased with two rigs added to the field since the end of the first quarter of  and workover rigs returning several dormant wells to service late in the first quarter of   this increased level of activity is largely due to the customer turnover weve experienced behind the system in the last several quarters and we expect that it will lead to increasing volumes in the second half of marcellus shalethe mountaineer midstream system provides our midstream services for the marcellus shale reportable segment this system gathers highpressure natural gas received from upstream pipeline interconnections with antero midstream partners lp and crestwood equity partners lp  natural gas on the mountaineer midstream system is delivered to the sherwood processing complex located in doddridge county west virginia segment adjusted ebitda for the marcellus shale segment totaled  million for the first quarter of  an increase of  from  million for the prioryear period primarily due to  million of rightofway repair expenses incurred in the prioryear period  volume throughput for this segment averaged  mmcfd in the first quarter of  a decrease of  from  mmcfd in the prioryear period and an increase of  from the  mmcfd in the fourth quarter of   volume throughput increased relative to the fourth quarter of  as a result of our customer commissioning new wells behind our system  we expect our customer to continue to complete its inventory of ducs behind the mountaineer midstream system throughout the balance of the year which we expect will drive volumes higher particularly in the second half of  mvc shortfall paymentssmlp billed its customers  million in the first quarter of  related to mvcs  for those customers that do not have credit banking mechanisms in their gathering agreements or do not have the ability to use mvc shortfall payments as credits the mvc shortfall payments are accounted for as gathering revenue in
