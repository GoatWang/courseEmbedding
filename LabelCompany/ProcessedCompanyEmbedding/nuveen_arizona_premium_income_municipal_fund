investors  advisors  more contact information risksinvestment market and price risk closedend fund shares are subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest  common shares frequently trade at a discount to their nav  at any point in time your common shares may be worth less than you paid even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributionsinterest rate risk fixedincome securities such as bonds preferred convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates risecredit risk debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due  investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default  unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency however such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposesleverage risk the fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share nav market price and distributions  leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio whether that return is positive or negative leverage is intended to increase common share net income but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful  different forms of leverage including swaps may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limitssingle state concentration risk because the fund primarily purchases municipal bonds from a single state or us territories such as puerto rico the fund is more susceptible to adverse local economic political or regulatory changes affecting municipal bond issuers in those locations certain municipal bond issuers in puerto rico have recently experienced financial difficulties and rating agency downgradesinverse floater risk the fund invests in inverse floaters due to their leveraged nature these derivative investments can greatly increase a fund’s exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk including counterparty credit risk in addition investments in inverse floaters involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investmenttax risk the tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the internal revenue service or state tax authoritiescall risk or prepayment risk issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled forcing the fund to reinvest in loweryielding securitieshedging risk the fund may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes but there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful  derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount investedmunicipal bond market liquidity risk inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years either due to brokerdealer choices or to federal banking regulations reducing their ability to make a market in these securities this may decrease the fund’s ability to buy or sell bonds and may increase bond price volatility and trading costs particularly during periods of economic or market stress as a result the fund may be forced to sell a security at a lower price than desired to sell other securities to raise cash or to give up an investment opportunity any of which could have a negative effect on performance large block sales could further reduce bond prices and hurt fund performance notes  the premiumdiscount is calculated as most recent pricemost recent nav  income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax capital gains if any will be subject to capital gains tax †† income only distributions distributions are sourced entirely from net investment income unless noted otherwise distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution annualized relative to the most recent market price and nav special distributions
