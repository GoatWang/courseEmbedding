act of  was introduced on may   by senator john e sununu with over  cosponsors it was reported favorably out of the us senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs without amendment on july   the senate passed it with a technical amendment samdt  by unanimous consent on november   the house of representatives passed it  on december   a similar bill hr  had previously passed in the house but it was the senate bill which was passed by both chambers the engrossed bill was presented to president george w bush on december   and he signed it into law on december   program detailsedit the program began on january   and like the  state quarters program was not scheduled to end until every eligible subject was honored the program was to issue coins featuring each of four presidents per year on the obverse issuing one for three months before moving on to the next president in chronological order by term in office to be eligible a president must have been deceased for at least two years prior to the time of minting the us mint called it the presidential  coin program the reverse of the coins bears the statue of liberty the inscription  and the inscription united states of america inscribed along the edge of the coin is the year of minting or issuance of the coin the mint mark  stars and also the legend e pluribus unum in the following arrangement ★★★★★★★★★★    d  ★★★  e pluribus unum before  in god we trust was also part of the edge lettering the legend liberty is absent from the coin altogether since the decision was made that the image of the statue of liberty on the reverse of the coin was sufficient to convey the message of liberty the text of the act does not specify the color of the coins but per the us mint the specifications will be identical to those used for the current golden dollar the george washington  coin was first available to the public on february   in honor of presidents day which was observed on february  this marked the first time since the st gaudens double eagle – that the united states had issued a coin with edge lettering for circulation edgelettered coins date back to the s the process was started to discourage the shaving of gold coin edges a practice which was used to cheat payees in december  congress passed hr  moving in god we trust to either the obverse or reverse of the coins this is the same bill that created a program that will include quarters for washington dc puerto rico northern mariana islands guam the us virgin islands and american samoa the act had been introduced because of the failure of the sacagawea  coin to gain widespread circulation in the united states the act sympathized with the need of the nations private sector for a  coin and expected that the appeal of changing the design would increase the public demand for new coins as the public generally responded well to the state quarter program the program was also intended to help educate the public about the nations presidents and their history in the event that the coins did not catch on with the general public the mint hoped that collectors would be as interested in the dollars as they were with the state quarters which generated about  billion in seigniorage ie the difference between the face value of the coins and the cost to produce them between january  and april  according to a report by the congressional budget officefull citation needed stack showing writing on edge unlike the state quarter program and the westward journey nickel series which suspended the issuance of the current design during those programs the act directed the mint to continue to issue sacagawea dollar coins during the presidential series the law states that at least one in three issued dollars must be a sacagawea dollar furthermore the sacagawea design is required to continue after the presidential coin program ends these requirements were added at the behest of the north dakota congressional delegation to ensure that sacagawea whom north dakotans consider to be one of their own ultimately remains on the dollar coin however federal reserve officials indicated to congress that if the presidential  coin program does not stimulate substantial transactional demand for dollar coins the requirement that the mint nonetheless produce sacagawea dollars would result in costs to the taxpayer without any offsetting benefits in that event the federal reserve indicated that it would strongly recommend that congress reassess the onethird requirement the onethird requirement was later changed to onefifth by the native american  coin act passed on september   previous versions of the act called for removing from circulation dollar coins issued before the sacagawea dollar most notably the susan b anthony dollar but the version of the act which became law merely directs the secretary of the treasury to study the matter and report back to congress the act required federal government agencies including the united states postal service businesses operating on federal property and federally funded transit systems to accept and dispense dollar coins by january  and to post signs indicating that they do so minting errorsedit on march   the united states mint announced that on february   an unknown number of george washington presidential  coins were released into circulation without their edge inscriptions the us mottos in god we trust and e pluribus unum the coins mint mark and its year of issuance ie e pluribus unum  •  in god we trust  •     x where x is either p or d ron guth of the professional coin grading service estimated at least  coins were released without the edge inscriptions the first such coin discovered was sold on ebay for  while later coins were selling for – as of late march  because one of the inscriptions missing from the coins is the motto in god we trust some articles on the subject have referred to them as godless dollars fake godless dollars have been produced with the edge lettering filed off also john adams presidential dollars have been discovered with plain edges they are fewer in quantity than george washington plainedge dollars making them rarer thus more expensive a more frequently encountered edge lettering error for the john adams dollar is a coin with doubled edge lettering this error occurs when a coin passes through the edge lettering machine twice most examples of the doublededgeletter john adams dollar are from the philadelphia mint denver mint issues are comparatively scarce they are seen in two varieties  with both edge lettering inscriptions reading in the same direction called overlapped and  with the two inscriptions running in opposite directions—ie inverted or upsidedown relative to one another—called inverted in early march  a colorado couple found a dollar coin that was not stamped on either side missing the portrait of george washington and the statue of liberty some of the coins have the words on the rim struck upside down president face up these are not minting errors but rather a variation created by the minting process such upsidedown coins have been sold on auction websites like ebay and amazon for greater than their face value though they represent roughly  of the minted population stockpile and suspension of productionedit a graph showing mintages of issues minted from  to  by   billion uncirculated  coins were stockpiled which if stacked flat could reach from los angeles to chicago by  this number might have reached two billion rep jackie speier of california circulated a dear colleague letter recommending that the us not produce any dollar coins she was planning to introduce legislation calling for the immediate halting of all dollar coin programs the united states government accountability office has stated that discontinuing the dollar bill in favor of the dollar coin would save the us government about  billion over  years on december   vice president joe biden and treasury secretary timothy geithner announced that the minting of presidential  coins for circulation would be suspended future entries in the program beginning with those of chester a arthur would be issued in reduced quantities only for collectors the programs endedit the act specifies that for a former president to be honored they must have been deceased for at least two years before issue hence former presidents jimmy carter george hw bush bill clinton george w bush and barack obama were ineligible to have a dollar coin issued in their honor the series ended in  after honoring ronald reagan the last president who was eligible since the program has terminated producing coins for those presidents not yet honored would require another act of congress coin detailsedit

edmund c moy and first lady laura bush at the unveiling of dolley madisons first spouse coin on november   the united states has honored the spouses of each of the presidents honored by the presidential  coin act by issuing halfounce  gold coins featuring their images in the order they served as first spouse beginning in  to date all first spouses have been women often called first ladies but the law uses the term first spouse the obverse of these coins feature portraits of the nation’s first spouses their names the dates and order of their terms as first spouse as well as the year of minting or issuance and the words in god we trust and liberty the united states mint issued the first spouse gold coins on the same schedule as the presidential  coins issued honoring the presidents each coin has a unique reverse design featuring an image emblematic of that spouse’s life and work as well as the words the united states of america e pluribus unum   oz and  fine gold when a president served without a first spouse as thomas jefferson did a gold coin was issued bearing an obverse image emblematic of liberty as depicted on a circulating coin of that era and bearing a reverse image emblematic of themes of that president one exception is the coin depicting suffragist alice paul which represents the era of the chester a arthur presidency as arthur was a widower the act as written explicitly states that the first spouse coins are to be released at the same time as their respective  presidential coins because the act links a first spouses eligibility for a coin to that of the presidential spouse it means that a living first spouse may appear on a coin however with the death of nancy reagan on march   there are currently no living eligible first ladies the united states mint launched these coins officially at  pm edt on june   they provided two versions of the coin a proof version for  and an uncirculated version for  the united states mint also

iwerks at the walt disney studios in  an anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts large yellow shoes and white gloves mickey has become one of the worlds most recognizable characters mickey first appeared in a test screening short plane crazy mickey officially debuted in the short film steamboat willie  one of the first sound cartoons he went on to appear in over  films including the band concert  brave little tailor  and fantasia  mickey appeared primarily in short films but also occasionally in featurelength films ten of mickeys cartoons were nominated for the academy award for best animated short film one of which lend a paw won the award in  in  mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the hollywood walk of fame beginning in  mickey has also been featured extensively as a comic strip character his selftitled newspaper strip drawn primarily by floyd gottfredson ran for  years mickey has also appeared in comic books such as disney italys topolino mm mickey mouse mystery magazine and wizards of mickey and in television series such as the mickey mouse club – and others he also appears in other media such as video games as well as merchandising and is a meetable character at the disney parks mickey generally appears alongside his girlfriend minnie mouse his pet dog pluto his friends donald duck and goofy and his nemesis pete among others see mickey mouse universe though originally characterized as a mischievous antihero mickey was rebranded over time as an everyman usually seen as a flawed but adventurous hero in  disney

earliest known drawings of the character from the collection of the walt disney family museum i only hope that we never lose sight of one thing – that it was all started by a mouse — walt disney disneyland october   mickey mouse was created as a replacement for oswald the lucky rabbit an earlier cartoon character created by the disney studio for charles mintz a film producer who distributed product through universal studios in the spring of  with the series going strong disney asked mintz for an increase in the budget but mintz instead demanded that walt take a  percent budget cut and as leverage he reminded disney that universal owned the character and revealed that he had already signed most of disneys current employees to his new contract angrily disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final oswald cartoons he contractually owed mintz disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to restart from scratch the new disney studio initially consisted of animator ub iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist les clark who together with wilfred jackson were among the few who remained loyal to walt one lesson disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company in the spring of  disney asked ub iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas iwerks tried sketches of various animals such as dogs and cats but none of these appealed to disney a female cow and male horse were also rejected they would later turn up as clarabelle cow and horace horsecollar a male frog was also rejected it would later show up in iwerks own flip the frog series walt disney got the inspiration for mickey mouse from a tame mouse at his desk at laughogram studio in kansas city missouri in  hugh harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of walt disney these inspired ub iwerks to create a new mouse character for disney mortimer mouse had been disneys original name for the character before his wife lillian convinced him to change it and ultimately mickey mouse came to be the actor mickey rooney claimed that during his mickey mcguire days he met cartoonist walt disney at the warner brothers studio and that disney was inspired to name mickey mouse after him this claim however has been debunked by disney historian jim korkis since at the time of mickey mouses development disney studios had been located on hyperion avenue for several years and walt disney never kept an office or other working space at warner brothers having no professional relationship with warner brothers as the alice comedies and oswald cartoons were distributed by universal design this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may  learn how and when to remove this template message the silhouette of mickey mouses head has become an iconic image throughout the earlier years mickeys design bore heavy resemblance to oswald save for the ears nose and tail ub iwerks designed mickeys body out of circles in order to make the character simple to animate disney employees john hench and marc davis believed that this design was part of mickeys success as it made him more dynamic and appealing to audiences mickeys circular design is most noticeable in his ears in animation in the s mickeys ears were animated in a more realistic perspective later they were drawn to always appear circular no matter which way mickey was facing this made mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark the circular rule later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a threedimensional mickey in  animator fred moore redesigned mickeys body away from its circular design to a pearshaped design colleague ward kimball praised moore for being the first animator to break from mickeys rubber hose round circle design although moore himself was nervous at first about changing mickey walt disney liked the new design and told moore thats the way i want mickey to be drawn from now on each of mickeys hands has only three fingers and a thumb disney said that this was both an artistic and financial decision explaining artistically five digits are too many for a mouse his hand would look like a bunch of bananas financially not having an extra finger in each of  drawings that make up a six and onehalf minute short has saved the studio millions in the film the opry house  mickey was first given white gloves as a way of contrasting his naturally black hands against his black body the use of white gloves would prove to be an influential design for cartoon characters particularly with later disney characters but also with nondisney characters such as bugs bunny woody woodpecker mighty mouse and mario mickeys eyes as drawn in plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho were large and white with black outlines in steamboat willie the bottom portion of the black outlines was removed although the upper edges still contrasted with his head mickeys eyes were later reimagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were originally his pupils while what were the upper edges of his eyes became a hairline this is evident only when mickey blinks fred moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave his face a caucasian skin tone instead of plain white this new mickey first appeared in  on the cover of a party program and in animation the following year with the release of the pointer mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in the simple things  and in the comic strip although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances some of mickeys appearance particularly the gloves and facial characteristics evolved from blackface caricatures used in minstrel shows besides mickeys gloves and shoes he typically wears only a pair of shorts with two large buttons in the front before mickey was seen regularly in color animation mickeys shorts were either red or a dull bluegreen with the advent of mickeys color films the shorts were always red when mickey is not wearing his red shorts he is often still wearing red clothing such as a red bandmaster coat the band concert the mickey mouse club red overalls clock cleaners boat builders a red cloak fantasia fun and fancy free a red coat squatters rights mickeys christmas carol or a red shirt mickey down under the simple things animation history see also mickey mouse film series debut  mickeys first appearance in steamboat willie  disney had ub iwerks secretly begin animating a new cartoon while still under contract with universal the cartoon was codirected by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks was the main animator for the short and reportedly spent six weeks working on it in fact iwerks was the main animator for every disney short released in  and  hugh harman and rudolf ising also assisted disney during those years they had already signed their contracts with charles mintz but he was still in the process of forming his new studio and so for the time being they were still employed by disney this short would be the last they animated under this somewhat awkward situation mickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short plane crazy on may   but it failed to impress the audience and to add insult to injury walt could not find a distributor though understandably disappointed walt went on to produce a second mickey short the gallopin gaucho which was also not released for lack of a distributor steamboat willie was first released on november   in new york it was codirected by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks again served as the head animator assisted by johnny cannon les clark wilfred jackson and dick lundy this short was intended as a parody of buster keatons steamboat bill jr first released on may  of the same year although it was the third mickey cartoon produced it was the first to find a distributor and thus is considered by the disney company as mickeys debut willie featured changes to mickeys appearance in particular simplifying his eyes to large dots that established his look for later cartoons and in numerous walt disney films the cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the action fleischer studios headed by brothers dave and max fleischer had already released a number of sound cartoons using the deforest system in the mids however these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film for willie disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat this precise timing is apparent during the turkey in the straw sequence when mickeys actions exactly match the accompanying instruments animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the films original music this role has been variously attributed to wilfred jackson carl stalling and bert lewis but identification remains uncertain walt disney himself was voice actor for both mickey and minnie and would remain the source of mickeys voice through  for theatrical cartoons jimmy macdonald took over the role in  but walt provided mickeys voice again from  to  for the mickey mouse club television series on abc audiences at the time of steamboat willies release were reportedly impressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes sound films or talkies were still considered innovative the first featurelength movie with dialogue sequences the jazz singer starring al jolson was released on october   within a year of its success most united states movie theaters had installed sound film equipment walt disney apparently intended to take advantage of this new trend and arguably managed to succeed most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to disney as a result mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time walt disney soon worked on adding sound to both plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho which had originally been silent releases and their new release added to mickeys success and popularity a fourth mickey short the barn dance was also put into production however mickey does not actually speak until the karnival kid in  when his first spoken words were hot dogs hot dogs after steamboat willie was released mickey became a close competitor to felix the cat and his popularity would grow as he was continuously featured in sound cartoons by  felix would lose popularity among theater audiences and pat sullivan decided to produce all future felix cartoons in sound as a result unfortunately audiences did not respond well to felixs transition to sound and by  felix had faded from the screen black and white films – mickey with minnie mouse in building a building  in mickeys early films he was often characterized not as a hero but as an ineffective young suitor to minnie mouse the barn dance march   is the first time in which mickey is turned down by minnie in favor of pete the opry house march   was the first time in which mickey wore his white gloves mickey wears them in almost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed suit supposedly one reason for adding the white gloves was to allow audiences to distinguish the characters hands when they appeared against their bodies as both were blackcitation needed the three lines on the back of mickeys gloves represent darts in the gloves fabric extending from between the digits of the hand typical of glove design of the era when the cats away april   essentially a remake of the alice comedy alice rattled by rats was an unusual appearance for mickey although mickey and minnie still maintained their anthropomorphic characteristics they were depicted as the size of regular mice and living with a community many other mice as pests in a home mickey and minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their own setting in appearances with real humans mickey has been shown to be about two to three feet high the next mickey short was also unusual the barnyard battle april   was the only film to depict mickey as a soldier and also the first to place him in combat the karnival kid  was the first time mickey spoke before this he had only whistled laughed and grunted his first words were hot dogs hot dogs said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival mickeys follies  introduced the song minnies yoohoo which would become the theme song for mickey mouse films for the next several years the minnies yoohoo song sequence was also later reused with different background animation as its own special short shown only at the commencement of s theaterbased mickey mouse clubs mickeys dog pluto first appeared as mickeys pet in the moose hunt  after previously appearing as minnies dog rover in the picnic  the cactus kid april   was the last film to be animated by ub iwerks at disney shortly before the release of the film iwerks left to start his own studio bankrolled by disneys thendistributor pat powers powers and disney had a falling out over money due disney from the distribution deal it was in response to losing the right to distribute disneys cartoons that powers made the deal with iwerks who had long harbored a desire to head his own studio the departure is considered a turning point in mickeys career as well as that of walt disney walt lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since  mickey lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction andor animation of several of the shorts released till this point advertising for the early mickey mouse cartoons credited them as a walt disney comic drawn by ub iwerks later disney company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit walt disney alone disney and his remaining staff continued the production of the mickey series and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace iwerks as the great depression progressed and felix the cat faded from the movie screen mickeys popularity would rise and by  the mickey mouse club would have one million members at the th academy awards in  mickey received his first academy award nomination received for mickeys orphans  walt disney also received an honorary academy award for the creation of mickey mouse despite being eclipsed by the silly symphonies short the three little pigs in  mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too until  when polls showed that popeye was more popular than mickey by  mickey merchandise had earned  a year in  disney began to phase out the mickey mouse clubs due to administration problems about this time story artists at disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for mickey as he had developed into a role model for children they were limited in the types of gags they could make this led to mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing for more emphasis on other characters in orphans benefit august   mickey first appeared with donald duck who had been introduced earlier that year in the silly symphonies series the tempestuous duck would provide disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in mickeys cartoons color films – mickey in the band concert  mickey first appeared animated in color in parade of the award nominees in  however the film strip was created for the th academy awards ceremony and was not released to the public mickeys official first color film came in  with the band concert the technicolor film process was used in the film production here mickey conducted the william tell overture but the band is swept up by a tornado it is said that conductor arturo toscanini so loved this short that upon first seeing it he asked the projectionist to run it again in  the band concert was voted the thirdgreatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals by colorizing and partially redesigning mickey walt would put mickey back on top once again and mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal also in  walt would receive a special award from the league of nations for creating mickey however by  the more manic donald duck would surpass the passive mickey resulting in a redesign of the mouse between  and  that put mickey at the peak of his popularity the second half of the s saw the character goofy reintroduced as a series regular together mickey donald duck and goofy would go on several adventures together several of the films by the comic trio are some of mickeys most critically acclaimed films including mickeys fire brigade  moose hunters  clock cleaners  lonesome ghosts  boat builders  and mickeys trailer  also during this era mickey would star in brave little tailor  an adaptation of the valiant little tailor which was nominated for an academy award mickey was redesigned by animator fred moore which was first seen in the pointer  instead of having solid black eyes mickey was given white eyes with pupils a caucasian skin colored face and a pearshaped body in the s he changed once more in the little whirlwind where he used his trademark pants for the last time in decades lost his tail got more realistic ears that changed with perspective and a different body anatomy but this change would only last for a short period of time before returning to the one in the pointer with the exception of his pants in his final theatrical cartoons in the s he was given eyebrows which were removed in the more recent cartoons mickey in fantasia  in  mickey appeared in his first featurelength film fantasia his screen role as the sorcerers apprentice set to the symphonic poem of the same name by paul dukas is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of mickeys most iconic roles the segment features no dialogue at all only the music the apprentice mickey not willing to do his chores puts on the sorcerers magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore—filling up a deep well using two buckets of water when the well eventually overflows mickey finds himself unable to control the broom leading to a nearflood after the segment ends mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with leopold stokowski who conducts all the music heard in fantasia mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerers hat in merchandising it was also featured into the climax of fantasmic an attraction at the disney theme parks after  mickeys popularity would decline until his  reemergence as a daily childrens television personality despite this the character continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until  winning his only competitive academy award—with canine companion pluto—for a short subject lend a paw and again from  to  the last regular installment of the mickey mouse film series came in  with the simple things in which mickey and pluto go fishing and are pestered by a flock of seagulls television and later films in the s mickey became more known for his appearances on television particularly with the mickey mouse club many of his theatrical cartoon shorts were rereleased on television series such as ink  paint club various forms of the walt disney anthology television series and on home video mickey returned to theatrical animation in  with mickeys christmas carol an adaptation of charles dickens a christmas carol in which mickey played bob cratchit this was followed up in  with the prince and the pauper throughout the decades mickey mouse competed with warner bros bugs bunny for animated popularity but in  the two rivals finally shared screen time in the robert zemeckis disneyamblin film who framed roger rabbit disney and warner signed an agreement stating that each character had the same amount of screen time in the scene similar to his animated inclusion into a liveaction film on

large part of mickeys screen persona is his famously shy falsetto voice from  onward mickey was voiced by walt disney himself a task in which disney took great personal pride however by  disney was

daily strip created by floyd gottfredson and published december  mickey first appeared in comics after he had appeared in  commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public walt disney was approached by king features syndicate with the offer to license mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip disney accepted and mickey made his first comic strip appearance on january   the comical plot was credited to disney himself art to ub iwerks and inking to win smith the first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of plane crazy minnie soon became the first addition to the cast the strips first released between january   and march   has been occasionally reprinted in comic book form under the collective title lost on a desert island animation historian jim korkis notes after the eighteenth strip iwerks left and his inker win smith continued drawing the gagaday format in early  after iwerks departure disney was at first content to continue scripting the mickey mouse comic strip assigning the art to win smith however disneys focus had always been in animation and smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script draw and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation disney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the studio he selected floyd gottfredson a recently hired employee at the time gottfredson was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment disney had to assure him the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation gottfredson accepted and ended up holding this temporary assignment from may   to november   walt disneys last script for the strip appeared may   gottfredsons first task was to finish the storyline disney had started on april   the storyline was completed on september   and later reprinted in comic book form as mickey mouse in death valley this early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included mickey and minnie among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were clarabelle cow horace horsecollar and black pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer sylvester shyster and minnies uncle mortimer mouse the death valley narrative was followed by mr slicker and the egg robbers first printed between september  and december   which introduced marcus mouse and his wife as minnies parents starting with these two early comic strip stories mickeys versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other while disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure this adventurous version of mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the th and into the st century floyd gottfredson left his mark with stories such as mickey mouse joins the foreign legion  and the gleam  he also created the phantom blot eega beeva morty and ferdie captain churchmouse and butch besides gottfredson

the band concert  brave little tailor  and fantasia  mickey appeared primarily in short films but also occasionally in featurelength films ten of mickeys cartoons were nominated for the academy award for best animated short film one of which lend a paw won the award in  in  mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the hollywood walk of fame beginning in  mickey has also been featured extensively as a comic strip character his selftitled newspaper strip drawn primarily by floyd gottfredson ran for  years mickey has also appeared in comic books such as disney italys topolino mm mickey mouse mystery magazine and wizards of mickey and in television series such as the mickey mouse club – and others he also appears in other media such as video games as well as merchandising and is a meetable character at the disney parks mickey generally appears alongside his girlfriend minnie mouse his pet dog pluto his friends donald duck and goofy and his nemesis pete among others see mickey mouse universe though originally characterized as a mischievous antihero mickey was rebranded over time as an everyman usually seen as a flawed but adventurous hero in  disney

earliest known drawings of the character from the collection of the walt disney family museum i only hope that we never lose sight of one thing – that it was all started by a mouse — walt disney disneyland october   mickey mouse was created as a replacement for oswald the lucky rabbit an earlier cartoon character created by the disney studio for charles mintz a film producer who distributed product through universal studios in the spring of  with the series going strong disney asked mintz for an increase in the budget but mintz instead demanded that walt take a  percent budget cut and as leverage he reminded disney that universal owned the character and revealed that he had already signed most of disneys current employees to his new contract angrily disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final oswald cartoons he contractually owed mintz disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to restart from scratch the new disney studio initially consisted of animator ub iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist les clark who together with wilfred jackson were among the few who remained loyal to walt one lesson disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company in the spring of  disney asked ub iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas iwerks tried sketches of various animals such as dogs and cats but none of these appealed to disney a female cow and male horse were also rejected they would later turn up as clarabelle cow and horace horsecollar a male frog was also rejected it would later show up in iwerks own flip the frog series walt disney got the inspiration for mickey mouse from a tame mouse at his desk at laughogram studio in kansas city missouri in  hugh harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of walt disney these inspired ub iwerks to create a new mouse character for disney mortimer mouse had been disneys original name for the character before his wife lillian convinced him to change it and ultimately mickey mouse came to be the actor mickey rooney claimed that during his mickey mcguire days he met cartoonist walt disney at the warner brothers studio and that disney was inspired to name mickey mouse after him this claim however has been debunked by disney historian jim korkis since at the time of mickey mouses development disney studios had been located on hyperion avenue for several years and walt disney never kept an office or other working space at warner brothers having no professional relationship with warner brothers as the alice comedies and oswald cartoons were distributed by universal design this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may  learn how and when to remove this template message the silhouette of mickey mouses head has become an iconic image throughout the earlier years mickeys design bore heavy resemblance to oswald save for the ears nose and tail ub iwerks designed mickeys body out of circles in order to make the character simple to animate disney employees john hench and marc davis believed that this design was part of mickeys success as it made him more dynamic and appealing to audiences mickeys circular design is most noticeable in his ears in animation in the s mickeys ears were animated in a more realistic perspective later they were drawn to always appear circular no matter which way mickey was facing this made mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark the circular rule later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a threedimensional mickey in  animator fred moore redesigned mickeys body away from its circular design to a pearshaped design colleague ward kimball praised moore for being the first animator to break from mickeys rubber hose round circle design although moore himself was nervous at first about changing mickey walt disney liked the new design and told moore thats the way i want mickey to be drawn from now on each of mickeys hands has only three fingers and a thumb disney said that this was both an artistic and financial decision explaining artistically five digits are too many for a mouse his hand would look like a bunch of bananas financially not having an extra finger in each of  drawings that make up a six and onehalf minute short has saved the studio millions in the film the opry house  mickey was first given white gloves as a way of contrasting his naturally black hands against his black body the use of white gloves would prove to be an influential design for cartoon characters particularly with later disney characters but also with nondisney characters such as bugs bunny woody woodpecker mighty mouse and mario mickeys eyes as drawn in plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho were large and white with black outlines in steamboat willie the bottom portion of the black outlines was removed although the upper edges still contrasted with his head mickeys eyes were later reimagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were originally his pupils while what were the upper edges of his eyes became a hairline this is evident only when mickey blinks fred moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave his face a caucasian skin tone instead of plain white this new mickey first appeared in  on the cover of a party program and in animation the following year with the release of the pointer mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in the simple things  and in the comic strip although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances some of mickeys appearance particularly the gloves and facial characteristics evolved from blackface caricatures used in minstrel shows besides mickeys gloves and shoes he typically wears only a pair of shorts with two large buttons in the front before mickey was seen regularly in color animation mickeys shorts were either red or a dull bluegreen with the advent of mickeys color films the shorts were always red when mickey is not wearing his red shorts he is often still wearing red clothing such as a red bandmaster coat the band concert the mickey mouse club red overalls clock cleaners boat builders a red cloak fantasia fun and fancy free a red coat squatters rights mickeys christmas carol or a red shirt mickey down under the simple things animation history see also mickey mouse film series debut  mickeys first appearance in steamboat willie  disney had ub iwerks secretly begin animating a new cartoon while still under contract with universal the cartoon was codirected by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks was the main animator for the short and reportedly spent six weeks working on it in fact iwerks was the main animator for every disney short released in  and  hugh harman and rudolf ising also assisted disney during those years they had already signed their contracts with charles mintz but he was still in the process of forming his new studio and so for the time being they were still employed by disney this short would be the last they animated under this somewhat awkward situation mickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short plane crazy on may   but it failed to impress the audience and to add insult to injury walt could not find a distributor though understandably disappointed walt went on to produce a second mickey short the gallopin gaucho which was also not released for lack of a distributor steamboat willie was first released on november   in new york it was codirected by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks again served as the head animator assisted by johnny cannon les clark wilfred jackson and dick lundy this short was intended as a parody of buster keatons steamboat bill jr first released on may  of the same year although it was the third mickey cartoon produced it was the first to find a distributor and thus is considered by the disney company as mickeys debut willie featured changes to mickeys appearance in particular simplifying his eyes to large dots that established his look for later cartoons and in numerous walt disney films the cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the action fleischer studios headed by brothers dave and max fleischer had already released a number of sound cartoons using the deforest system in the mids however these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film for willie disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat this precise timing is apparent during the turkey in the straw sequence when mickeys actions exactly match the accompanying instruments animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the films original music this role has been variously attributed to wilfred jackson carl stalling and bert lewis but identification remains uncertain walt disney himself was voice actor for both mickey and minnie and would remain the source of mickeys voice through  for theatrical cartoons jimmy macdonald took over the role in  but walt provided mickeys voice again from  to  for the mickey mouse club television series on abc audiences at the time of steamboat willies release were reportedly impressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes sound films or talkies were still considered innovative the first featurelength movie with dialogue sequences the jazz singer starring al jolson was released on october   within a year of its success most united states movie theaters had installed sound film equipment walt disney apparently intended to take advantage of this new trend and arguably managed to succeed most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to disney as a result mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time walt disney soon worked on adding sound to both plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho which had originally been silent releases and their new release added to mickeys success and popularity a fourth mickey short the barn dance was also put into production however mickey does not actually speak until the karnival kid in  when his first spoken words were hot dogs hot dogs after steamboat willie was released mickey became a close competitor to felix the cat and his popularity would grow as he was continuously featured in sound cartoons by  felix would lose popularity among theater audiences and pat sullivan decided to produce all future felix cartoons in sound as a result unfortunately audiences did not respond well to felixs transition to sound and by  felix had faded from the screen black and white films – mickey with minnie mouse in building a building  in mickeys early films he was often characterized not as a hero but as an ineffective young suitor to minnie mouse the barn dance march   is the first time in which mickey is turned down by minnie in favor of pete the opry house march   was the first time in which mickey wore his white gloves mickey wears them in almost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed suit supposedly one reason for adding the white gloves was to allow audiences to distinguish the characters hands when they appeared against their bodies as both were blackcitation needed the three lines on the back of mickeys gloves represent darts in the gloves fabric extending from between the digits of the hand typical of glove design of the era when the cats away april   essentially a remake of the alice comedy alice rattled by rats was an unusual appearance for mickey although mickey and minnie still maintained their anthropomorphic characteristics they were depicted as the size of regular mice and living with a community many other mice as pests in a home mickey and minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their own setting in appearances with real humans mickey has been shown to be about two to three feet high the next mickey short was also unusual the barnyard battle april   was the only film to depict mickey as a soldier and also the first to place him in combat the karnival kid  was the first time mickey spoke before this he had only whistled laughed and grunted his first words were hot dogs hot dogs said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival mickeys follies  introduced the song minnies yoohoo which would become the theme song for mickey mouse films for the next several years the minnies yoohoo song sequence was also later reused with different background animation as its own special short shown only at the commencement of s theaterbased mickey mouse clubs mickeys dog pluto first appeared as mickeys pet in the moose hunt  after previously appearing as minnies dog rover in the picnic  the cactus kid april   was the last film to be animated by ub iwerks at disney shortly before the release of the film iwerks left to start his own studio bankrolled by disneys thendistributor pat powers powers and disney had a falling out over money due disney from the distribution deal it was in response to losing the right to distribute disneys cartoons that powers made the deal with iwerks who had long harbored a desire to head his own studio the departure is considered a turning point in mickeys career as well as that of walt disney walt lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since  mickey lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction andor animation of several of the shorts released till this point advertising for the early mickey mouse cartoons credited them as a walt disney comic drawn by ub iwerks later disney company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit walt disney alone disney and his remaining staff continued the production of the mickey series and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace iwerks as the great depression progressed and felix the cat faded from the movie screen mickeys popularity would rise and by  the mickey mouse club would have one million members at the th academy awards in  mickey received his first academy award nomination received for mickeys orphans  walt disney also received an honorary academy award for the creation of mickey mouse despite being eclipsed by the silly symphonies short the three little pigs in  mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too until  when polls showed that popeye was more popular than mickey by  mickey merchandise had earned  a year in  disney began to phase out the mickey mouse clubs due to administration problems about this time story artists at disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for mickey as he had developed into a role model for children they were limited in the types of gags they could make this led to mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing for more emphasis on other characters in orphans benefit august   mickey first appeared with donald duck who had been introduced earlier that year in the silly symphonies series the tempestuous duck would provide disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in mickeys cartoons color films – mickey in the band concert  mickey first appeared animated in color in parade of the award nominees in  however the film strip was created for the th academy awards ceremony and was not released to the public mickeys official first color film came in  with the band concert the technicolor film process was used in the film production here mickey conducted the william tell overture but the band is swept up by a tornado it is said that conductor arturo toscanini so loved this short that upon first seeing it he asked the projectionist to run it again in  the band concert was voted the thirdgreatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals by colorizing and partially redesigning mickey walt would put mickey back on top once again and mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal also in  walt would receive a special award from the league of nations for creating mickey however by  the more manic donald duck would surpass the passive mickey resulting in a redesign of the mouse between  and  that put mickey at the peak of his popularity the second half of the s saw the character goofy reintroduced as a series regular together mickey donald duck and goofy would go on several adventures together several of the films by the comic trio are some of mickeys most critically acclaimed films including mickeys fire brigade  moose hunters  clock cleaners  lonesome ghosts  boat builders  and mickeys trailer  also during this era mickey would star in brave little tailor  an adaptation of the valiant little tailor which was nominated for an academy award mickey was redesigned by animator fred moore which was first seen in the pointer  instead of having solid black eyes mickey was given white eyes with pupils a caucasian skin colored face and a pearshaped body in the s he changed once more in the little whirlwind where he used his trademark pants for the last time in decades lost his tail got more realistic ears that changed with perspective and a different body anatomy but this change would only last for a short period of time before returning to the one in the pointer with the exception of his pants in his final theatrical cartoons in the s he was given eyebrows which were removed in the more recent cartoons mickey in fantasia  in  mickey appeared in his first featurelength film fantasia his screen role as the sorcerers apprentice set to the symphonic poem of the same name by paul dukas is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of mickeys most iconic roles the segment features no dialogue at all only the music the apprentice mickey not willing to do his chores puts on the sorcerers magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore—filling up a deep well using two buckets of water when the well eventually overflows mickey finds himself unable to control the broom leading to a nearflood after the segment ends mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with leopold stokowski who conducts all the music heard in fantasia mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerers hat in merchandising it was also featured into the climax of fantasmic an attraction at the disney theme parks after  mickeys popularity would decline until his  reemergence as a daily childrens television personality despite this the character continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until  winning his only competitive academy award—with canine companion pluto—for a short subject lend a paw and again from  to  the last regular installment of the mickey mouse film series came in  with the simple things in which mickey and pluto go fishing and are pestered by a flock of seagulls television and later films in the s mickey became more known for his appearances on television particularly with the mickey mouse club many of his theatrical cartoon shorts were rereleased on television series such as ink  paint club various forms of the walt disney anthology television series and on home video mickey returned to theatrical animation in  with mickeys christmas carol an adaptation of charles dickens a christmas carol in which mickey played bob cratchit this was followed up in  with the prince and the pauper throughout the decades mickey mouse competed with warner bros bugs bunny for animated popularity but in  the two rivals finally shared screen time in the robert zemeckis disneyamblin film who framed roger rabbit disney and warner signed an agreement stating that each character had the same amount of screen time in the scene similar to his animated inclusion into a liveaction film on roger rabbit mickey made a featured cameo appearance in the  television special the muppets at walt disney world where he met kermit the frog the two are established in the story as having been old friends the muppets have otherwise spoofed and referenced mickey over a dozen times since the s eventually the muppets were purchased by the walt disney company in  mickey in disneys house of mouse – his most recent theatrical cartoon short was s get a horse which was preceded by s runaway brain while from  to  he appeared in directtovideo features like mickeys once upon a christmas mickey donald

mickeys late twentiesearly thirties look with a contemporary twist voice actors walt disney the cocreator of mickey mouse and founder of the walt disney company was the original voice of mickey a large part of mickeys screen persona is his famously shy falsetto voice from  onward mickey was voiced by walt disney himself a task in which disney took great personal pride however by  disney was becoming too busy with running the studio to do regular voice work which meant he could not do mickeys voice anymore it is also speculated that his cigarette habit had damaged his voice over the years after recording the mickey and the beanstalk section of fun and fancy free mickeys voice was handed over to veteran disney musician and actor jimmy macdonald macdonald voiced mickey in the remainder of the theatrical shorts and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in the mids although walt voiced mickey again for the introductions to the original – run of the mickey mouse club tv series and the fourth anniversary show episode of the disneyland tv series aired on september   composer carl w stalling was the very first person to provide lines for mickey in the  short the karnival kid clarence nash voiced mickey in the  disney short the dognapper around the time when it was filmed walt was traveling in europe and was unavailable to record his lines for

until his death in  allwine once recounted something macdonald had told him about voicing mickey the main piece of advice that jim gave me about mickey helped me keep things in perspective he said just remember kid you’re only filling in for the boss and that’s the way he treated doing mickey for years and years from walt and now from jimmy allwine would eventually marry russi taylor the voice

producers were looking for a retro voice to match the vintage look of the series mickey in comics main article mickey mouse and friends comic book mickey and horace horsecollar from the mickey mouse daily strip created by floyd gottfredson and published december  mickey first appeared in comics after he had appeared in  commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public walt disney was approached by king features syndicate with the offer to license mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip disney accepted and mickey made his first comic strip appearance on january   the comical plot was credited to disney himself art to ub iwerks and inking to win smith the first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of plane crazy minnie soon became the first addition to the cast the strips first released between january   and march   has been occasionally reprinted in comic book form under the collective title lost on a desert island animation historian jim korkis notes after the eighteenth strip iwerks left and his inker win smith continued drawing the gagaday format in early  after iwerks departure disney was at first content to continue scripting the mickey mouse comic strip assigning the art to win smith however disneys focus had always been in animation and smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script draw and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation disney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the studio he selected floyd gottfredson a recently hired employee at the time gottfredson was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment disney had to assure him the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation gottfredson accepted and ended up holding this temporary assignment from may   to november   walt disneys last script for the strip appeared may   gottfredsons first task was to finish the storyline disney had started on april   the storyline was completed on september   and later reprinted in comic book form as mickey mouse in death valley this early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included mickey and minnie among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were clarabelle cow horace horsecollar and black pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer sylvester shyster and minnies uncle mortimer mouse the death valley narrative was followed by mr slicker and the egg robbers first printed between september  and december   which introduced marcus mouse and his wife as minnies parents starting with these two early comic strip stories mickeys versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other while disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure this adventurous version of mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the th and into the st century floyd gottfredson left his mark with stories such as mickey mouse joins the foreign legion  and the gleam  he also created the phantom blot eega beeva morty and ferdie captain churchmouse and butch besides gottfredson artists for the strip over the years included roman arambula rick hoover manuel gonzales carson van osten jim engel bill wright ted thwailes and daan jippes writers included ted osborne merrill de maris bill walsh dick shaw roy williams del connell and floyd norman the next artist to leave his mark on the character was paul murry in dell comics his first mickey tale appeared in  but mickey did not become a specialty until murrys first serial for walt disneys comics and stories in  the last resort in the same period romano scarpa in italy for the magazine topolino began to revitalize mickey

earliest known drawings of the character from the collection of the walt disney family museum i only hope that we never lose sight of one thing – that it was all started by a mouse — walt disney disneyland october   mickey mouse was created as a replacement for oswald the lucky rabbit an earlier cartoon character created by the disney studio for charles mintz a film producer who distributed product through universal studios in the spring of  with the series going strong disney asked mintz for an increase in the budget but mintz instead demanded that walt take a  percent budget cut and as leverage he reminded disney that universal owned the character and revealed that he had already signed most of disneys current employees to his new contract angrily disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final oswald cartoons he contractually owed mintz disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to restart from scratch the new disney studio initially consisted of animator ub iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist les clark who together with wilfred jackson were among the few who remained loyal to walt one lesson disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company in the spring of  disney asked ub iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas iwerks tried sketches of various animals such as dogs and cats but none of these appealed to disney a female cow and male horse were also rejected they would later turn up as clarabelle cow and horace horsecollar a male frog was also rejected it would later show up in iwerks own flip the frog series walt disney got the inspiration for mickey mouse from a tame mouse at his desk at laughogram studio in kansas city missouri in  hugh harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of walt disney these inspired ub iwerks to create a new mouse character for disney mortimer mouse had been disneys original name for the character before his wife lillian convinced him to change it and ultimately mickey mouse came to be the actor mickey rooney claimed that during his mickey mcguire days he met cartoonist walt disney at the warner brothers studio and that disney was inspired to name mickey mouse after him this claim however has been debunked by disney historian jim korkis since at the time of mickey mouses development disney studios had been located on hyperion avenue for several years and walt disney never kept an office or other working space at warner brothers having no professional relationship with warner brothers as the alice comedies and oswald cartoons were distributed by universal design this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may  learn how and when to remove this template message the silhouette of mickey mouses head has become an iconic image throughout the earlier years mickeys design bore heavy resemblance to oswald save for the ears nose and tail ub iwerks designed mickeys body out of circles in order to make the character simple to animate disney employees john hench and marc davis believed that this design was part of mickeys success as it made him more dynamic and appealing to audiences mickeys circular design is most noticeable in his ears in animation in the s mickeys ears were animated in a more realistic perspective later they were drawn to always appear circular no matter which way mickey was facing this made mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark the circular rule later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a threedimensional mickey in  animator fred moore redesigned mickeys body away from its circular design to a pearshaped design colleague ward kimball praised moore for being the first animator to break from mickeys rubber hose round circle design although moore himself was nervous at first about changing mickey walt disney liked the new design and told moore thats the way i want mickey to be drawn from now on each of mickeys hands has only three fingers and a thumb disney said that this was both an artistic and financial decision explaining artistically five digits are too many for a mouse his hand would look like a bunch of bananas financially not having an extra finger in each of  drawings that make up a six and onehalf minute short has saved the studio millions in the film the opry house  mickey was first given white gloves as a way of contrasting his naturally black hands against his black body the use of white gloves would prove to be an influential design for cartoon characters particularly with later disney characters but also with nondisney characters such as bugs bunny woody woodpecker mighty mouse and mario mickeys eyes as drawn in plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho were large and white with black outlines in steamboat willie the bottom portion of the black outlines was removed although the upper edges still contrasted with his head mickeys eyes were later reimagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were originally his pupils while what were the upper edges of his eyes became a hairline this is evident only when mickey blinks fred moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave his face a caucasian skin tone instead of plain white this new mickey first appeared in  on the cover of a party program and in animation the following year with the release of the pointer mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in the simple things  and in the comic strip although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances some of mickeys appearance particularly the gloves and facial characteristics evolved from blackface caricatures used in minstrel shows besides mickeys gloves and shoes he typically wears only a pair of shorts with two large buttons in the front before mickey was seen regularly in color animation mickeys shorts were either red or a dull bluegreen with the advent of mickeys color films the shorts were always red when mickey is not wearing his red shorts he is often still wearing red clothing such as a red bandmaster coat the band concert the mickey mouse club red overalls clock cleaners boat builders a red cloak fantasia fun and fancy free a red coat squatters rights mickeys christmas carol or a red shirt mickey down under the simple things animation history see also mickey mouse film series debut  mickeys first appearance in steamboat willie  disney had ub iwerks secretly begin animating a new cartoon while still under contract with universal the cartoon was codirected by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks was the main animator for the short and reportedly spent six weeks working on it in fact iwerks was the main animator for every disney short released in  and  hugh harman and rudolf ising also assisted disney during those years they had already signed their contracts with charles mintz but he was still in the process of forming his new studio and so for the time being they were still employed by disney this short would be the last they animated under this somewhat awkward situation mickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short plane crazy on may   but it failed to impress the audience and to add insult to injury walt could not find a distributor though understandably disappointed walt went on to produce a second mickey short the gallopin gaucho which was also not released for lack of a distributor steamboat willie was first released on november   in new york it was codirected by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks again served as the head animator assisted by johnny cannon les clark wilfred jackson and dick lundy this short was intended as a parody of buster keatons steamboat bill jr first released on may  of the same year although it was the third mickey cartoon produced it was the first to find a distributor and thus is considered by the disney company as mickeys debut willie featured changes to mickeys appearance in particular simplifying his eyes to large dots that established his look for later cartoons and in numerous walt disney films the cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the action fleischer studios headed by brothers dave and max fleischer had already released a number of sound cartoons using the deforest system in the mids however these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film for willie disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat this precise timing is apparent during the turkey in the straw sequence when mickeys actions exactly match the accompanying instruments animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the films original music this role has been variously attributed to wilfred jackson carl stalling and bert lewis but identification remains uncertain walt disney himself was voice actor for both mickey and minnie and would remain the source of mickeys voice through  for theatrical cartoons jimmy macdonald took over the role in  but walt provided mickeys voice again from  to  for the mickey mouse club television series on abc audiences at the time of steamboat willies release were reportedly impressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes sound films or talkies were still considered innovative the first featurelength movie with dialogue sequences the jazz singer starring al jolson was released on october   within a year of its success most united states movie theaters had installed sound film equipment walt disney apparently intended to take advantage of this new trend and arguably managed to succeed most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to disney as a result mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time walt disney soon worked on adding sound to both plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho which had originally been silent releases and their new release added to mickeys success and popularity a fourth mickey short the barn dance was also put into production however mickey does not actually speak until the karnival kid in  when his first spoken words were hot dogs hot dogs after steamboat willie was released mickey became a close competitor to felix the cat and his popularity would grow as he was continuously featured in sound cartoons by  felix would lose popularity among theater audiences and pat sullivan decided to produce all future felix cartoons in sound as a result unfortunately audiences did not respond well to felixs transition to sound and by  felix had faded from the screen black and white films – mickey with minnie mouse in building a building  in mickeys early films he was often characterized not as a hero but as an ineffective young suitor to minnie mouse the barn dance march   is the first time in which mickey is turned down by minnie in favor of pete the opry house march   was the first time in which mickey wore his white gloves mickey wears them in almost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed suit supposedly one reason for adding the white gloves was to allow audiences to distinguish the characters hands when they appeared against their bodies as both were blackcitation needed the three lines on the back of mickeys gloves represent darts in the gloves fabric extending from between the digits of the hand typical of glove design of the era when the cats away april   essentially a remake of the alice comedy alice rattled by rats was an unusual appearance for mickey although mickey and minnie still maintained their anthropomorphic characteristics they were depicted as the size of regular mice and living with a community many other mice as pests in a home mickey and minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their own setting in appearances with real humans mickey has been shown to be about two to three feet high the next mickey short was also unusual the barnyard battle april   was the only film to depict mickey as a soldier and also the first to place him in combat the karnival kid  was the first time mickey spoke before this he had only whistled laughed and grunted his first words were hot dogs hot dogs said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival mickeys follies  introduced the song minnies yoohoo which would become the theme song for mickey mouse films for the next several years the minnies yoohoo song sequence was also later reused with different background animation as its own special short shown only at the commencement of s theaterbased mickey mouse clubs mickeys dog pluto first appeared as mickeys pet in the moose hunt  after previously appearing as minnies dog rover in the picnic  the cactus kid april   was the last film to be animated by ub iwerks at disney shortly before the release of the film iwerks left to start his own studio bankrolled by disneys thendistributor pat powers powers and disney had a falling out over money due disney from the distribution deal it was in response to losing the right to distribute disneys cartoons that powers made the deal with iwerks who had long harbored a desire to head his own studio the departure is considered a turning point in mickeys career as well as that of walt disney walt lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since  mickey lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction andor animation of several of the shorts released till this point advertising for the early mickey mouse cartoons credited them as a walt disney comic drawn by ub iwerks later disney company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit walt disney alone disney and his remaining staff continued the production of the mickey series and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace iwerks as the great depression progressed and felix the cat faded from the movie screen mickeys popularity would rise and by  the mickey mouse club would have one million members at the th academy awards in  mickey received his first academy award nomination received for mickeys orphans  walt disney also received an honorary academy award for the creation of mickey mouse despite being eclipsed by the silly symphonies short the three little pigs in  mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too until  when polls showed that popeye was more popular than mickey by  mickey merchandise had earned  a year in  disney began to phase out the mickey mouse clubs due to administration problems about this time story artists at disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for mickey as he had developed into a role model for children they were limited in the types of gags they could make this led to mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing for more emphasis on other characters in orphans benefit august   mickey first appeared with donald duck who had been introduced earlier that year in the silly symphonies series the tempestuous duck would provide disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in mickeys cartoons color films – mickey in the band concert  mickey first appeared animated in color in parade of the award nominees in  however the film strip was created for the th academy awards ceremony and was not released to the public mickeys official first color film came in  with the band concert the technicolor film process was used in the film production here mickey conducted the william tell overture but the band is swept up by a tornado it is said that conductor arturo toscanini so loved this short that upon first seeing it he asked the projectionist to run it again in  the band concert was voted the thirdgreatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals by colorizing and partially redesigning mickey walt would put mickey back on top once again and mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal also in  walt would receive a special award from the league of nations for creating mickey however by  the more manic donald duck would surpass the passive mickey resulting in a redesign of the mouse between  and  that put mickey at the peak of his popularity the second half of the s saw the character goofy reintroduced as a series regular together mickey donald duck and goofy would go on several adventures together several of the films by the comic trio are some of mickeys most critically acclaimed films including mickeys fire brigade  moose hunters  clock cleaners  lonesome ghosts  boat builders  and mickeys trailer  also during this era mickey would star in brave little tailor  an adaptation of the valiant little tailor which was nominated for an academy award mickey was redesigned by animator fred moore which was first seen in the pointer  instead of having solid black eyes mickey was given white eyes with pupils a caucasian skin colored face and a pearshaped body in the s he changed once more in the little whirlwind where he used his trademark pants for the last time in decades lost his tail got more realistic ears that changed with perspective and a different body anatomy but this change would only last for a short period of time before returning to the one in the pointer with the exception of his pants in his final theatrical cartoons in the s he was given eyebrows which were removed in the more recent cartoons mickey in fantasia  in  mickey appeared in his first featurelength film fantasia his screen role as the sorcerers apprentice set to the symphonic poem of the same name by paul dukas is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of mickeys most iconic roles the segment features no dialogue at all only the music the apprentice mickey not willing to do his chores puts on the sorcerers magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore—filling up a deep well using two buckets of water when the well eventually overflows mickey finds himself unable to control the broom leading to a nearflood after the segment ends mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with leopold stokowski who conducts all the music heard in fantasia mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerers hat in merchandising it was also featured into the climax of fantasmic an attraction at the disney theme parks after  mickeys popularity would decline until his  reemergence as a daily childrens television personality despite this the character continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until  winning his only competitive academy award—with canine companion pluto—for a short subject lend a paw and again from  to  the last regular installment of the mickey mouse film series came in  with the simple things in

returned to theatrical animation in  with mickeys christmas carol an adaptation of charles dickens a christmas carol in which mickey played bob cratchit this was followed up in  with the prince and the pauper throughout the decades mickey mouse competed with warner bros bugs bunny for animated popularity but in  the two rivals finally shared screen time in the robert zemeckis disneyamblin film who framed roger rabbit disney and warner signed an agreement stating that each character had the same amount of screen time in the scene similar to his animated inclusion into a liveaction film on roger rabbit mickey made a featured cameo appearance in the  television special the muppets at walt disney world where he met kermit the frog the two are established in the story as having been old

mickeys late twentiesearly thirties look with a contemporary twist voice actors walt disney the cocreator of mickey mouse and founder of the walt disney company was the original voice of mickey a large part of mickeys screen persona is his famously shy falsetto voice from  onward mickey was voiced by walt disney himself a task in which disney took great personal pride however by  disney was becoming too busy with running the studio to do regular voice work which meant he could not do mickeys voice anymore it is also speculated that his cigarette habit had damaged his voice over the years after recording the mickey and the beanstalk section of fun and fancy free mickeys voice was handed over to veteran disney musician and actor jimmy macdonald macdonald voiced mickey in the remainder of the theatrical shorts and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in the mids although walt voiced mickey again for the introductions to the original – run of the

daily strip created by floyd gottfredson and published december  mickey first appeared in comics after he had appeared in  commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public walt disney was approached by king features syndicate with the offer to license mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip disney accepted and mickey made his first comic strip appearance on january   the comical plot was credited to disney himself art to ub iwerks and inking to win smith the first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of plane crazy minnie soon became the first addition to the cast the strips first released between january   and march   has been occasionally reprinted in comic book form under the collective title lost on a desert island animation historian jim korkis notes after the eighteenth strip iwerks left and his inker win smith continued drawing the gagaday format in early  after iwerks departure disney was at first content to continue scripting the mickey mouse comic strip assigning the art to win smith however disneys focus had always been in animation and smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script draw and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation disney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the studio he selected floyd gottfredson a recently hired employee at the time gottfredson was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment disney had to assure him the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation gottfredson accepted and ended up holding this temporary assignment from may   to november   walt disneys last script for the strip appeared may   gottfredsons first task was to finish the storyline disney had started on april   the storyline was completed on september   and later reprinted in comic book form as mickey mouse in death valley this early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included mickey and minnie among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were clarabelle cow horace horsecollar and black pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer sylvester shyster and minnies uncle mortimer mouse the death valley narrative was followed by mr slicker and the egg robbers first printed between september  and december   which introduced marcus mouse and his wife as minnies parents starting with these two early comic strip stories mickeys versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other while disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure this adventurous version of mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the th and into the st century floyd gottfredson left his mark with stories such as mickey mouse joins the foreign legion  and the gleam  he also created the phantom blot eega beeva morty and ferdie captain churchmouse and butch besides gottfredson

maris bill walsh dick shaw roy williams del connell and floyd norman the next artist to leave his mark on the character was paul murry in dell comics his first mickey tale appeared in  but mickey did not become a specialty until murrys first serial for walt disneys comics and stories in  the last resort in the same period romano scarpa in italy for the magazine topolino began to revitalize mickey in stories that brought back the phantom blot and eega beeva along with new creations such as the atomo bleepbleep while the stories at western publishing during the silver age emphasized mickey as a detective in the style of sherlock holmes in the modern era several editors and creators have consciously undertaken to depict a more vigorous mickey in the mold of the classic gottfredson adventures

symbol of the ip industry and its attitude towards copyright infringement mickey mouses global fame has made him both a symbol of the walt disney company and of the united states itself for this

commercially by its owner so whether or not a particular disney cartoon goes into the public domain the characters themselves may not be used as trademarks without authorization because of the

union and other jurisdictions where copyright terms have been extended works such as the early mickey mouse cartoons will remain under copyright until at least  however some copyright scholars argue that disneys copyright on the earliest version of the character may be invalid due to ambiguity in the copyright notice for steamboat willie the walt disney company has become well known for

in the first issue cartoonist dan oneill depicted mickey and minnie mouse engaging in explicit sexual behavior and consuming drugs as oneill explained the air pirates were…some sort of bizarre concept to steal the air pirate the air steal the media…since we were cartoonists the logical thing was disney rather than change the appearance or name of the character which oneill felt would dilute the parody the mouse depicted in air pirates funnies looks like and is named mickey mouse disney sued for copyright infringement and after a series of appeals oneill eventually lost and was ordered to pay disney  million the outcome of the case remains controversial among freespeech advocates new york law school professor edward samuels said the air pirates set parody back twenty

earliest known drawings of the character from the collection of the walt disney family museum i only hope that we never lose sight of one thing – that it was all started by a mouse — walt disney disneyland october   mickey mouse was created as a replacement for oswald the lucky rabbit an earlier cartoon character created by the disney studio for charles mintz a film producer who distributed product through universal studios in the spring of  with the series going strong disney asked mintz for an increase in the budget but mintz instead demanded that walt take a  percent budget cut and as leverage he reminded disney that universal owned the character and revealed that he had already signed most of disneys current employees to his new contract angrily disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final oswald cartoons he contractually owed mintz disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to restart from scratch the new disney studio initially consisted of animator ub iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist les clark who together with wilfred jackson were among the few who remained loyal to walt one lesson disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company in the spring of  disney asked ub iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas iwerks tried sketches of various animals such as dogs and cats but none of these appealed to disney a female cow and male horse were also rejected they would later turn up as clarabelle cow and horace horsecollar a male frog was also rejected it would later show up in iwerks own flip the frog series walt disney got the inspiration for mickey mouse from a tame mouse at his desk at laughogram studio in kansas city missouri in  hugh harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of walt disney these inspired ub iwerks to create a new mouse character for disney mortimer mouse had been disneys original name for the character before his wife lillian convinced him to change it and ultimately mickey mouse came to be the actor mickey rooney claimed that during his mickey mcguire days he met cartoonist walt disney at the warner brothers studio and that disney was inspired to name mickey mouse after him this claim however has been debunked by disney historian jim korkis since at the time of mickey mouses development disney studios had been located on hyperion avenue for several years and walt disney never kept an office or other working space at warner brothers having no professional relationship with warner brothers as the alice comedies and oswald cartoons were distributed by universal design this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may  learn how and when to remove this template message the silhouette of mickey mouses head has become an iconic image throughout the earlier years mickeys design bore heavy resemblance to oswald save for the ears nose and tail ub iwerks designed mickeys body out of circles in order to make the character simple to animate disney employees john hench and marc davis believed that this design was part of mickeys success as it made him more dynamic and appealing to audiences mickeys circular design is most noticeable in his ears in animation in the s mickeys ears were animated in a more realistic perspective later they were drawn to always appear circular no matter which way mickey was facing this made mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark the circular rule later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a threedimensional mickey in  animator fred moore redesigned mickeys body away from its circular design to a pearshaped design colleague ward kimball praised moore for being the first animator to break from mickeys rubber hose round circle design although moore himself was nervous at first about changing mickey walt disney liked the new design and told moore thats the way i want mickey to be drawn from now on each of mickeys hands has only three fingers and a thumb disney said that this was both an artistic and financial decision explaining artistically five digits are too many for a mouse his hand would look like a bunch of bananas financially not having an extra finger in each of  drawings that make up a six and onehalf minute short has saved the studio millions in the film the opry house  mickey was first given white gloves as a way of contrasting his naturally black hands against his black body the use of white gloves would prove to be an influential design for cartoon characters particularly with later disney characters but also with nondisney characters such as bugs bunny woody woodpecker mighty mouse and mario mickeys eyes as drawn in plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho were large and white with black outlines in steamboat willie the bottom portion of the black outlines was removed although the upper edges still contrasted with his head mickeys eyes were later reimagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were originally his pupils while what were the upper edges of his eyes became a hairline this is evident only when mickey blinks fred moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave his face a caucasian skin tone instead of plain white this new mickey first appeared in  on the cover of a party program and in animation the following year with the release of the pointer mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in the simple things  and in the comic strip although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances some of mickeys appearance particularly the gloves and facial characteristics evolved from blackface caricatures used in minstrel shows besides mickeys gloves and shoes he typically wears only a pair of shorts with two large buttons in the front before mickey was seen regularly in color animation mickeys shorts were either red or a dull bluegreen with the advent of mickeys color films the shorts were always red when mickey is not wearing his red shorts he is often still wearing red clothing such as a red bandmaster coat the band concert the mickey mouse club red overalls clock cleaners boat builders a red cloak fantasia fun and fancy free a red coat squatters rights mickeys christmas carol or a red shirt mickey down under the simple things animation history see also mickey mouse film series debut  mickeys first appearance in steamboat willie  disney had ub iwerks secretly begin animating a new cartoon while still under contract with universal the cartoon was codirected by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks was the main animator for the short and reportedly spent six weeks working on it in fact iwerks was the main animator for every disney short released in  and  hugh harman and rudolf ising also assisted disney during those years they had already signed their contracts with charles mintz but he was still in the process of forming his new studio and so for the time being they were still employed by disney this short would be the last they animated under this somewhat awkward situation mickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short plane crazy on may   but it failed to impress the audience and to add insult to injury walt could not find a distributor though understandably disappointed walt went on to produce a second mickey short the gallopin gaucho which was also not released for lack of a distributor steamboat willie was first released on november   in new york it was codirected by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks again served as the head animator assisted by johnny cannon les clark wilfred jackson and dick lundy this short was intended as a parody of buster keatons steamboat bill jr first released on may  of the same year although it was the third mickey cartoon produced it was the first to find a distributor and thus is considered by the disney company as mickeys debut willie featured changes to mickeys appearance in particular simplifying his eyes to large dots that established his look for later cartoons and in numerous walt disney films the cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the action fleischer studios headed by brothers dave and max fleischer had already released a number of sound cartoons using the deforest system in the mids however these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film for willie disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat this precise timing is apparent during the turkey in the straw sequence when mickeys actions exactly match the accompanying instruments animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the films original music this role has been variously attributed to wilfred jackson carl stalling and bert lewis but identification remains uncertain walt disney himself was voice actor for both mickey and minnie and would remain the source of mickeys voice through  for theatrical cartoons jimmy macdonald took over the role in  but walt provided mickeys voice again from  to  for the mickey mouse club television series on abc audiences at the time of steamboat willies release were reportedly impressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes sound films or talkies were still considered innovative the first featurelength movie with dialogue sequences the jazz singer starring al jolson was released on october   within a year of its success most united states movie theaters had installed sound film equipment walt disney apparently intended to take advantage of this new trend and arguably managed to succeed most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to disney as a result mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time walt disney soon worked on adding sound to both plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho which had originally been silent releases and their new release added to mickeys success and popularity a fourth mickey short the barn dance was also put into production however mickey does not actually speak until the karnival kid in  when his first spoken words were hot dogs hot dogs after steamboat willie was released mickey became a close competitor to felix the cat and his popularity would grow as he was continuously featured in sound cartoons by  felix would lose popularity among theater audiences and pat sullivan decided to produce all future felix cartoons in sound as a result unfortunately audiences did not respond well to felixs transition to sound and by  felix had faded from the screen black and white films – mickey with minnie mouse in building a building  in mickeys early films he was often characterized not as a hero but as an ineffective young suitor to minnie mouse the barn dance march   is the first time in which mickey is turned down by minnie in favor of pete the opry house march   was the first time in which mickey wore his white gloves mickey wears them in almost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed suit supposedly one reason for adding the white gloves was to allow audiences to distinguish the characters hands when they appeared against their bodies as both were blackcitation needed the three lines on the back of mickeys gloves represent darts in the gloves fabric extending from between the digits of the hand typical of glove design of the era when the cats away april   essentially a remake of the alice comedy alice rattled by rats was an unusual appearance for mickey although mickey and minnie still maintained their anthropomorphic characteristics they were depicted as the size of regular mice and living with a community many other mice as pests in a home mickey and minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their own setting in appearances with real humans mickey has been shown to be about two to three feet high the next mickey short was also unusual the barnyard battle april   was the only film to depict mickey as a soldier and also the first to place him in combat the karnival kid  was the first time mickey spoke before this he had only whistled laughed and grunted his first words were hot dogs hot dogs said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival mickeys follies  introduced the song minnies yoohoo which would become the theme song for mickey mouse films for the next several years the minnies yoohoo song sequence was also later reused with different background animation as its own special short shown only at the commencement of s theaterbased mickey mouse clubs mickeys dog pluto first appeared as mickeys pet in the moose hunt  after previously appearing as minnies dog rover in the picnic  the cactus kid april   was the last film to be animated by ub iwerks at disney shortly before the release of the film iwerks left to start his own studio bankrolled by disneys thendistributor pat powers powers and disney had a falling out over money due disney from the distribution deal it was in response to losing the right to distribute disneys cartoons that powers made the deal with iwerks who had long harbored a desire to head his own studio the departure is considered a turning point in mickeys career as well as that of walt disney walt lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since  mickey lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction andor animation of several of the shorts released till this point advertising for the early mickey mouse cartoons credited them as a walt disney comic drawn by ub iwerks later disney company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit walt disney alone disney and his remaining staff continued the production of the mickey series and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace iwerks as the great depression progressed and felix the cat faded from the movie screen mickeys popularity would rise and by  the mickey mouse club would have one million members at the th academy awards in  mickey received his first academy award nomination received for mickeys orphans  walt disney also received an honorary academy award for the creation of mickey mouse despite being eclipsed by the silly symphonies short the three little pigs in  mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too until  when polls showed that popeye was more popular than mickey by  mickey merchandise had earned  a year in  disney began to phase out the mickey mouse clubs due to administration problems about this time story artists at disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for mickey as he had developed into a role model for children they were limited in the types of gags they could make this led to mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing for more emphasis on other characters in orphans benefit august   mickey first appeared with donald duck who had been introduced earlier that year in the silly symphonies series the tempestuous duck would provide disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in mickeys cartoons color films – mickey in the band concert  mickey first appeared animated in color in parade of the award nominees in  however the film strip was created for the th academy awards ceremony and was not released to the public mickeys official first color film came in  with the band concert the technicolor film process was used in the film production here mickey conducted the william tell overture but the band is swept up by a tornado it is said that conductor arturo toscanini so loved this short that upon first seeing it he asked the projectionist to run it again in  the band concert was voted the thirdgreatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals by colorizing and partially redesigning mickey walt would put mickey back on top once again and mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal also in  walt would receive a special award from the league of nations for creating mickey however by  the more manic donald duck would surpass the passive mickey resulting in a redesign of the mouse between  and  that put mickey at the peak of his popularity the second half of the s saw the character goofy reintroduced as a series regular together mickey donald duck and goofy would go on several adventures together several of the films by the comic trio are some of mickeys most critically acclaimed films including mickeys fire brigade  moose hunters  clock cleaners  lonesome ghosts  boat builders  and mickeys trailer  also during this era mickey would star in brave little tailor  an adaptation of the valiant little tailor which was nominated for an academy award mickey was redesigned by animator fred moore which was first seen in the pointer  instead of

pants for the last time in decades lost his tail got more realistic ears that changed with perspective and a different body anatomy but this change would only last for a short period of time before returning to the one in the pointer with the exception of his pants in his final theatrical cartoons in the s he was given eyebrows which were removed in the more recent cartoons mickey in fantasia  in  mickey appeared in his first featurelength film fantasia his screen role as the sorcerers apprentice set to the symphonic poem of the same name by paul dukas is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of mickeys most iconic roles the segment features no dialogue at all only the music the apprentice mickey not willing to do his chores puts on the sorcerers magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore—filling up a deep well using two buckets of water when the well eventually overflows mickey finds himself unable to control the broom leading to a nearflood after the segment ends mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with leopold stokowski who conducts all the music

large part of mickeys screen persona is his famously shy falsetto voice from  onward mickey was voiced by walt disney himself a task in which disney took great personal pride however by  disney was becoming too busy with running the studio to do regular voice work which meant he could not do mickeys voice anymore it is also speculated that his cigarette habit had damaged his voice over the years

of the theatrical shorts and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in the mids although walt voiced mickey again for the introductions to the original – run of the

content to continue scripting the mickey mouse comic strip assigning the art to win smith however disneys focus had always been in animation and smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script draw and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation disney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the studio he selected floyd gottfredson a recently hired employee at the time gottfredson was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment disney

the band concert  brave little tailor  and fantasia  mickey appeared primarily in short films but also occasionally in featurelength films ten of mickeys cartoons were nominated for the academy award for best animated short film one of which lend a paw won the award in  in  mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the hollywood walk of fame beginning in  mickey has also been featured extensively as a comic strip character his selftitled newspaper strip drawn primarily by floyd gottfredson ran for  years mickey has also appeared in comic books such as disney italys

merchandising and is a meetable character at the disney parks mickey generally appears alongside his girlfriend minnie mouse his pet dog pluto his friends donald duck and goofy and his nemesis pete among others see mickey mouse universe though originally characterized as a mischievous antihero mickey was rebranded over time as an everyman usually seen as a flawed but adventurous hero in  disney

earliest known drawings of the character from the collection of the walt disney family museum i only hope that we never lose sight of one thing – that it was all started by a mouse — walt disney disneyland october   mickey mouse was created as a replacement for oswald the lucky rabbit an earlier cartoon character created by the disney studio for charles mintz a film producer who distributed product through universal studios in the spring of  with the series going strong disney asked mintz for an increase in the budget but mintz instead demanded that walt take a  percent budget cut and as leverage he reminded disney that universal owned the character and revealed that he had already signed most of disneys current employees to his new contract angrily disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final oswald cartoons he contractually owed mintz disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to restart from scratch the new disney studio initially consisted of animator ub iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist les clark who together with wilfred jackson were among the few who remained loyal to walt one lesson disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company in the spring of  disney asked ub iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas iwerks tried sketches of various animals such as dogs and cats but none of these appealed to disney a female cow and male horse were also rejected they would later turn up as clarabelle cow and horace horsecollar a male frog was also rejected it would later show up in iwerks own flip the frog series walt disney got the inspiration for mickey mouse from a tame mouse at his desk at laughogram studio in kansas city missouri in  hugh harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of walt disney these inspired ub iwerks to create a new mouse character for disney mortimer mouse had been disneys original name for the character before his wife lillian convinced him to change it and ultimately mickey mouse came to be the actor mickey rooney claimed that during his mickey mcguire days he met cartoonist walt disney at the warner brothers studio and that disney was inspired to name mickey mouse after him this claim however has been debunked by disney historian jim korkis since at the time of mickey mouses development disney studios had been located on hyperion avenue for several years and walt disney never kept an office or other working space at warner brothers having no professional relationship with warner brothers as the alice comedies and oswald cartoons were distributed by universal design this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may  learn how and when to remove this template message the silhouette of mickey mouses head has become an iconic image throughout the earlier years mickeys design bore heavy resemblance to oswald save for the ears nose and tail ub iwerks designed mickeys body out of circles in order to make the character simple to animate disney employees john hench and marc davis believed that this design was part of mickeys success as it made him more dynamic and appealing to audiences mickeys circular design is most noticeable in his ears in animation in the s mickeys ears were animated in a more realistic perspective later they were drawn to always appear circular no matter which way mickey was facing this made mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark the circular rule later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a threedimensional mickey in  animator fred moore redesigned mickeys body away from its circular design to a pearshaped design colleague ward kimball praised moore for being the first animator to break from mickeys rubber hose round circle design although moore himself was nervous at first about changing mickey walt disney liked the new design and told moore thats the way i want mickey to be drawn from now on each of mickeys hands has only three fingers and a thumb disney said that this was both an artistic and financial decision explaining artistically five digits are too many for a mouse his hand would look like a bunch of bananas financially not having an extra finger in each of  drawings that make up a six and onehalf minute short has saved the studio millions in the film the opry house  mickey was first given white gloves as a way of contrasting his naturally black hands against his black body the use of white gloves would prove to be an influential design for cartoon characters particularly with later disney characters but also with nondisney characters such as bugs bunny woody woodpecker mighty mouse and mario mickeys eyes as drawn in plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho were large and white with black outlines in steamboat willie the bottom portion of the black outlines was removed although the upper edges still contrasted with his head mickeys eyes were later reimagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were originally his pupils while what were the upper edges of his eyes became a hairline this is evident only when mickey blinks fred moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave his face a caucasian skin tone instead of plain white this new mickey first appeared in  on the cover of a party program and in animation the following year with the release of the pointer mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in the simple things  and in the comic strip although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances some of mickeys appearance particularly the gloves and facial characteristics evolved from blackface caricatures used in minstrel shows besides mickeys gloves and shoes he typically wears only a pair of shorts with two large buttons in the front before mickey was seen regularly in color animation mickeys shorts were either red or a dull bluegreen with the advent of mickeys color films the shorts were always red when mickey is not wearing his red shorts he is often still wearing red clothing such as a red bandmaster coat the band concert the mickey mouse club red overalls clock cleaners boat builders a red cloak fantasia fun and fancy free a red coat squatters rights mickeys christmas carol or a red shirt mickey down under the simple things animation history see also mickey mouse film series debut  mickeys first appearance in steamboat willie  disney had ub iwerks secretly begin animating a new cartoon while still under contract with universal the cartoon was codirected by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks was the main animator for the short and reportedly spent six weeks working on it in fact iwerks was the main animator for every disney short released in  and  hugh harman and rudolf ising also assisted disney during those years they had already signed their contracts with charles mintz but he was still in the process of forming his new studio and so for the time being they were still employed by disney this short would be the last they animated under this somewhat awkward situation mickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short plane crazy on may   but it failed to impress the audience and to add insult to injury walt could not find a distributor though understandably disappointed walt went on to produce a second mickey short the gallopin gaucho which was also not released for lack of a distributor steamboat willie was first released on november   in new york it was codirected by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks again served as the head animator assisted by johnny cannon les clark wilfred jackson and dick lundy this short was intended as a parody of buster keatons steamboat bill jr first released on may  of the same year although it was the third mickey cartoon produced it was the first to find a distributor and thus is considered by the disney company as mickeys debut willie featured changes to mickeys appearance in particular simplifying his eyes to large dots that established his look for later cartoons and in numerous walt disney films the cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the action fleischer studios headed by brothers dave and max fleischer had already released a number of sound cartoons using the deforest system in the mids however these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film for willie disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat this precise timing is apparent during the turkey in the straw sequence when mickeys actions exactly match the accompanying instruments animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the films original music this role has been variously attributed to wilfred jackson carl stalling and bert lewis but identification remains uncertain walt disney himself was voice actor for both mickey and minnie and would remain the source of mickeys voice through  for theatrical cartoons jimmy macdonald took over the role in  but walt provided mickeys voice again from  to  for the mickey mouse club television series on abc audiences at the time of steamboat willies release were reportedly impressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes sound films or talkies were still considered innovative the first featurelength movie with dialogue sequences the jazz singer starring al jolson was released on october   within a year of its success most united states movie theaters had installed sound film equipment walt disney apparently intended to take advantage of this new trend and arguably managed to succeed most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to disney as a result mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time walt disney soon worked on adding sound to both plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho which had originally been silent releases and their new release added to mickeys success and popularity a fourth mickey short the barn dance was also put into production however mickey does not actually speak until the karnival kid in  when his first spoken words were hot dogs hot dogs after steamboat willie was released mickey became a close competitor to felix the cat and his popularity would grow as he was continuously featured in sound cartoons by  felix would lose popularity among theater audiences and pat sullivan decided to produce all future felix cartoons in sound as a result unfortunately audiences did not respond well to felixs transition to sound and by  felix had faded from the screen black and white films – mickey with minnie mouse in building a building  in mickeys early films he was often characterized not as a hero but as an ineffective young suitor to minnie mouse the barn dance march   is the first time in which mickey is turned down by minnie in favor of pete the opry house march   was the first time in which mickey wore his white gloves mickey wears them in almost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed suit supposedly one reason for adding the white gloves was to allow audiences to distinguish the characters hands when they appeared against their bodies as both were blackcitation needed the three lines on the back of mickeys gloves represent darts in the gloves fabric extending from between the digits of the hand typical of glove design of the era when the cats away april   essentially a remake of the alice comedy alice rattled by rats was an unusual appearance for mickey although mickey and minnie still maintained their anthropomorphic characteristics they were depicted as the size of regular mice and living with a community many other mice as pests in a home mickey and minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their own setting in appearances with real humans mickey has been shown to be about two to three feet high the next mickey short was also unusual the barnyard battle april   was the only film to depict mickey as a soldier and also the first to place him in combat the karnival kid  was the first time mickey spoke before this he had only whistled laughed and grunted his first words were hot dogs hot dogs said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival mickeys follies  introduced the song minnies yoohoo which would become the theme song for mickey mouse films for the next several years the minnies yoohoo song sequence was also later reused with different background animation as its own special short shown only at the commencement of s theaterbased mickey mouse clubs mickeys dog pluto first appeared as mickeys pet in the moose hunt  after previously appearing as minnies dog rover in the picnic  the cactus kid april   was the last film to be animated by ub iwerks at disney shortly before the release of the film iwerks left to start his own studio bankrolled by disneys thendistributor pat powers powers and disney had a falling out over money due disney from the distribution deal it was in response to losing the right to distribute disneys cartoons that powers made the deal with iwerks who had long harbored a desire to head his own studio the departure is considered a turning point in mickeys career as well as that of walt disney walt lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since  mickey lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction andor animation of several of the shorts released till this point advertising for the early mickey mouse cartoons credited them as a walt disney comic drawn by ub iwerks later disney company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit walt disney alone disney and his remaining staff continued the production of the mickey series and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace iwerks as the great depression progressed and felix the cat faded from the movie screen mickeys popularity would rise and by  the mickey mouse club would have one million members at the th academy awards in  mickey received his first academy award nomination received for mickeys orphans  walt disney also received an honorary academy award for the creation of mickey mouse despite being eclipsed by the silly symphonies short the three little pigs in  mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too until  when polls showed that popeye was more popular than mickey by  mickey merchandise had earned  a year in  disney began to phase out the mickey mouse clubs due to administration problems about this time story artists at disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for mickey as he had developed into a role model for children they were limited in the types of gags they could make this led to mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing for more emphasis on other characters in orphans

large part of mickeys screen persona is his famously shy falsetto voice from  onward mickey was voiced by walt disney himself a task in which disney took great personal pride however by  disney was becoming too busy with running the studio to do regular voice work which meant he could not do mickeys voice anymore it is also speculated that his cigarette habit had damaged his voice over the years

daily strip created by floyd gottfredson and published december  mickey first appeared in comics after he had appeared in  commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public walt disney was approached by king features syndicate with the offer to license mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip disney accepted and mickey made his first comic strip appearance on january   the comical plot was credited to disney himself art to ub iwerks and inking to win smith the first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of plane crazy

island animation historian jim korkis notes after the eighteenth strip iwerks left and his inker win smith continued drawing the gagaday format in early  after iwerks departure disney was at first content to continue scripting the mickey mouse comic strip assigning the art to win smith however disneys focus had always been in animation and smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script draw and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation disney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the studio he selected floyd gottfredson a recently hired employee at the time gottfredson was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment disney had to assure him the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation gottfredson accepted and ended up holding this temporary assignment from may   to november   walt disneys last script for the strip appeared may   gottfredsons first task was to finish the storyline disney had started on april   the storyline was completed on september   and later reprinted in comic book form as mickey mouse in death valley this early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included mickey and minnie among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were clarabelle cow horace horsecollar and black pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer sylvester shyster and minnies uncle mortimer mouse the death valley narrative was followed by mr slicker and the egg robbers first printed between september  and december   which introduced marcus mouse and his wife as minnies parents starting with these two early comic strip stories mickeys versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other while disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy the comic strip

mickey first appeared in a test screening short plane crazy mickey officially debuted in the short film steamboat willie  one of the first sound cartoons he went on to appear in over  films including the band concert  brave little tailor  and fantasia  mickey appeared primarily in short films but also occasionally in featurelength films ten of mickeys cartoons were nominated for the academy award for best animated short film one of which lend a paw won the award in  in  mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the hollywood walk of fame beginning in  mickey has also been featured extensively as a comic strip character his selftitled newspaper strip drawn primarily by floyd gottfredson ran for  years mickey has also appeared in comic books such as disney italys topolino mm mickey mouse mystery magazine and wizards of mickey and in television series such as the mickey mouse club – and others he also appears in other media such as video games as well as merchandising and is a meetable character at the disney parks mickey generally appears alongside his girlfriend minnie mouse his pet dog pluto his friends donald duck and goofy and his nemesis pete among others see mickey mouse universe though originally characterized as a mischievous antihero mickey was rebranded over time as an everyman usually seen as a flawed but adventurous hero in  disney

earliest known drawings of the character from the collection of the walt disney family museum i only hope that we never lose sight of one thing – that it was all started by a mouse — walt disney disneyland october   mickey mouse was created as a replacement for oswald the lucky rabbit an earlier cartoon character created by the disney studio for charles mintz a film producer who distributed product through universal studios in the spring of  with the series going strong disney asked mintz for an increase in the budget but mintz instead demanded that walt take a  percent budget cut and as leverage he reminded disney that universal owned the character and revealed that he had already signed most of disneys current employees to his new contract angrily disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final oswald cartoons he contractually owed mintz disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to restart from scratch the new disney studio initially consisted of animator ub iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist les clark who together with wilfred jackson were among the few who remained loyal to walt one lesson disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company in the spring of  disney asked ub iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas iwerks tried sketches of various animals such as dogs and cats but none of these appealed to disney a female cow and male horse were also rejected they would later turn up as clarabelle cow and horace horsecollar a male frog was also rejected it would later show up in iwerks own flip the frog series walt disney got the inspiration for mickey mouse from a tame mouse at his desk at laughogram studio in kansas city missouri in  hugh harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of walt disney these inspired ub iwerks to create a new mouse character for disney mortimer mouse had been disneys original name for the character before his wife lillian convinced him to change it and ultimately mickey mouse came to be the actor mickey rooney claimed that during his mickey mcguire days he met cartoonist walt disney at the warner brothers studio and that disney was inspired to name mickey mouse after him this claim however has been debunked by disney historian jim korkis since at the time of mickey mouses development disney studios had been located on hyperion avenue for several years and walt disney never kept an office or other working space at warner brothers having no professional relationship with warner brothers as the alice comedies and oswald cartoons were distributed by universal design this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may  learn how and when to remove this template message the silhouette of mickey mouses head has become an iconic image throughout the earlier years mickeys design bore heavy resemblance to oswald save for the ears nose and tail ub iwerks designed mickeys body out of circles in order to make the character simple to animate disney employees john hench and marc davis believed that this design was part of mickeys success as it made him more dynamic and appealing to audiences mickeys circular design is most noticeable in his ears in animation in the s mickeys ears were animated in a more realistic perspective later they were drawn to always appear circular no matter which way mickey was facing this made mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark the circular rule later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a threedimensional mickey in  animator fred moore redesigned mickeys body away from its circular design to a pearshaped design colleague ward kimball praised moore for being the first animator to break from mickeys rubber hose round circle design although moore himself was nervous at first about changing mickey walt disney liked the new design and told moore thats the way i want mickey to be drawn from now on each of mickeys hands has only three fingers and a thumb disney said that this was both an artistic and financial decision explaining artistically five digits are too many for a mouse his hand would look like a bunch of bananas financially not having an extra finger in each of  drawings that make up a six and onehalf minute short has saved the studio millions in the film the opry house  mickey was first given white gloves as a way of contrasting his naturally black hands against his black body the use of white gloves would prove to be an influential design for cartoon characters particularly with later disney characters but also with nondisney characters such as bugs bunny woody woodpecker mighty mouse and mario mickeys eyes as drawn in plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho were large and white with black outlines in steamboat willie the bottom portion of the black outlines was removed although the upper edges still contrasted with his head mickeys eyes were later reimagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were originally his pupils while what were the upper edges of his eyes became a hairline this is evident only when mickey blinks fred moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave his face a caucasian skin tone instead of plain white this new mickey first appeared in  on the cover of a party program and in animation the following year with the release of the pointer mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in the simple things  and in the comic strip although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances some of mickeys appearance particularly the gloves and facial characteristics evolved from blackface caricatures used in minstrel shows besides mickeys gloves and shoes he typically wears only a pair of shorts with two large buttons in the front before mickey was seen regularly in color animation mickeys shorts were either red or a dull bluegreen with the advent of mickeys color films the shorts were always red when mickey is not wearing his red shorts he is often still wearing red clothing such as a red bandmaster coat the band concert the mickey mouse club red overalls clock cleaners boat builders a red cloak fantasia fun and fancy free a red coat squatters rights mickeys christmas carol or a red shirt mickey down under the simple things animation history see also mickey mouse film series debut  mickeys first appearance in steamboat willie  disney had ub iwerks secretly begin animating a new cartoon while still under contract with universal the cartoon was codirected by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks was the main animator for the short and reportedly spent six weeks working on it in fact iwerks was the main animator for every disney short released in  and  hugh harman and rudolf ising also assisted disney during those years they had already signed their contracts with charles mintz but he was still in the process of forming his new studio and so for the time being they were still employed by disney this short would be the last they animated under this somewhat awkward situation mickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short plane crazy on may   but it failed to impress the audience and to add insult to injury walt could not find a distributor though understandably disappointed walt went on to produce a second mickey short the gallopin gaucho which was also not released for lack of a distributor steamboat willie was first released on november   in new york it was codirected by walt disney and ub iwerks iwerks again served as the head animator assisted by johnny cannon les clark wilfred jackson and dick lundy this short was intended as a parody of buster keatons steamboat bill jr first released on may  of the same year although it was the third mickey cartoon produced it was the first to find a distributor and thus is considered by the disney company as mickeys debut willie featured changes to mickeys appearance in particular simplifying his eyes to large dots that established his look for later cartoons and in numerous walt disney films the cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the action fleischer studios headed by brothers dave and max fleischer had already released a number of sound cartoons using the deforest system in the mids however these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film for willie disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat this precise timing is apparent during the turkey in the straw sequence when mickeys actions exactly match the accompanying instruments animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the films original music this role has been variously attributed to wilfred jackson carl stalling and bert lewis but identification remains uncertain walt disney himself was voice actor for both mickey and minnie and would remain the source of mickeys voice through  for theatrical cartoons jimmy macdonald took over the role in  but walt provided mickeys voice again from  to  for the mickey mouse club television series on abc audiences at the time of steamboat willies release were reportedly impressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes sound films or talkies were still considered innovative the first featurelength movie with dialogue sequences the jazz singer starring al jolson was released on october   within a year of its success most united states movie theaters had installed sound film equipment walt disney apparently intended to take advantage of this new trend and arguably managed to succeed most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to disney as a result mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time walt disney soon worked on adding sound to both plane crazy and the gallopin gaucho which had originally been silent releases and their new release added to mickeys success and popularity a fourth mickey short the barn dance was also put into production however mickey does not actually speak until the karnival kid in  when his first spoken words were hot dogs hot dogs after steamboat willie was released mickey became a close competitor to felix the cat and his popularity would grow as he was continuously featured in sound cartoons by  felix would lose popularity among theater audiences and pat sullivan decided to produce all future felix cartoons in sound as a result unfortunately audiences did not respond well to felixs transition to sound and by  felix had faded from the screen black and white films – mickey with minnie mouse in building a building  in mickeys early films he was often characterized not as a hero but as an ineffective young suitor to minnie mouse the barn dance march   is the first time in which mickey is turned down by minnie in favor of pete the opry house march   was the first time in which mickey wore his white gloves mickey wears them in almost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed suit supposedly one reason for adding the white gloves was to allow audiences to distinguish the characters hands when they appeared against their bodies as both were blackcitation needed the three lines on the back of mickeys gloves represent darts in the gloves fabric extending from between the digits of the hand typical of glove design of the era when the cats away april   essentially a remake of the alice comedy alice rattled by rats was an unusual appearance for mickey although mickey and minnie still maintained their anthropomorphic characteristics they were depicted as the size of regular mice and living with a community many other mice as pests in a home mickey and minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their own setting in appearances with real humans mickey has been shown to be about two to three feet high the next mickey short was also unusual the barnyard battle april   was the only film to depict mickey as a soldier and also the first to place him in combat the karnival kid  was the first time mickey spoke before this he had only whistled laughed and grunted his first words were hot dogs hot dogs said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival mickeys follies  introduced the song minnies yoohoo which would become the theme song for mickey mouse films for the next several years the minnies yoohoo song sequence was also later reused with different background animation as its own special short shown only at the commencement of s theaterbased mickey mouse clubs mickeys dog pluto first appeared as mickeys pet in the moose hunt  after previously appearing as minnies dog rover in the picnic  the cactus kid april   was the last film to be animated by ub iwerks at disney shortly before the release of the film iwerks left to start his own studio bankrolled by disneys thendistributor pat powers powers and disney had a falling out over money due disney from the distribution deal it was in response to losing the right to distribute disneys cartoons that powers made the deal with iwerks who had long harbored a desire to head his own studio the departure is considered a turning point in mickeys career as well as that of walt disney walt lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since  mickey lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction andor animation of several of the shorts released till this point advertising for the early mickey mouse cartoons credited them as a walt disney comic drawn by ub iwerks later disney company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit walt disney alone disney and his remaining staff continued the production of the mickey series and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace iwerks as the great depression progressed and felix the cat faded from the movie screen mickeys popularity would rise and by  the mickey mouse club would have one million members at the th academy awards in  mickey received his first academy award nomination received for mickeys orphans  walt disney also received an honorary academy award for the creation of mickey mouse despite being eclipsed by the silly symphonies short the three little pigs in  mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too until  when polls showed that popeye was more popular than mickey by  mickey merchandise had earned  a year in  disney began to phase out the mickey mouse clubs due to administration problems about this time story artists at disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for mickey as he had developed into a role model for children they were limited in the types of gags they could make this led to mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing for more emphasis on other characters in orphans benefit august   mickey first appeared with donald duck who had been introduced earlier that year in the silly symphonies series the tempestuous duck would provide disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in mickeys cartoons color films – mickey in the band concert  mickey first appeared animated in color in parade of the award nominees in  however the film strip was created for the th academy awards ceremony and was not released to the public mickeys official first color film came in  with the band concert the technicolor film process was used in the film production here mickey conducted the william tell overture but the band is swept up by a tornado it is said that conductor arturo toscanini so loved this short that upon first seeing it he asked the projectionist to run it again in  the band concert was voted the thirdgreatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals by colorizing and partially redesigning mickey walt would put mickey back on top once again and mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal also in  walt would receive a special award from the league of nations for creating mickey however by  the more manic donald duck would surpass the passive mickey resulting in a redesign of the mouse between  and  that put mickey at the peak of his popularity the second half of the s saw the character goofy reintroduced as a series regular together mickey donald duck and goofy would go on several adventures together several of the films by the comic trio are some of mickeys most critically acclaimed films including mickeys fire brigade  moose hunters  clock cleaners  lonesome ghosts  boat builders  and mickeys trailer  also during this era mickey would star in brave little tailor  an adaptation of the valiant little tailor which was nominated for an academy award mickey was redesigned by animator fred moore which was first seen in the pointer  instead of having solid black eyes mickey was given white eyes with pupils a caucasian skin colored face and a pearshaped body in the s he changed once more in the little whirlwind where he used his trademark pants for the last time in decades lost his tail got more realistic ears that changed with perspective and a different body anatomy but this change would only last for a short period of time before returning to the one in the pointer with the exception of his pants in his final theatrical cartoons in the s he was given eyebrows which were removed in the more recent cartoons mickey in fantasia  in  mickey appeared in his first featurelength film fantasia his screen role as the sorcerers apprentice set to the symphonic poem of the same name by paul dukas is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of mickeys most iconic roles the segment features no dialogue at all only the music the apprentice mickey not willing to do his chores puts on the sorcerers magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore—filling up a deep well using two buckets of water when the well eventually overflows mickey finds himself unable to control the broom leading to a nearflood after the segment ends mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with leopold stokowski who conducts all the music heard in fantasia mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerers hat in merchandising it was also featured into the climax of fantasmic an attraction at the disney theme parks after  mickeys popularity would decline until his  reemergence as a daily childrens television personality despite this the character continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until  winning his only competitive academy award—with canine companion pluto—for a short subject lend a paw and again from  to  the last regular installment of the mickey mouse film series came in  with the simple things in which mickey and pluto go fishing and are pestered by a flock of seagulls television and later films in the s mickey became more known for his appearances on television particularly with the mickey mouse club many of his theatrical cartoon shorts were rereleased on television series such as ink  paint club various forms of the walt disney anthology television series and on home video mickey returned to theatrical animation in  with mickeys christmas carol an adaptation of charles dickens a christmas carol in which mickey played bob cratchit this was followed up in  with the prince and the pauper throughout the decades mickey mouse competed with warner bros bugs bunny for animated popularity but in  the two rivals finally shared screen time in the robert zemeckis disneyamblin film who framed roger rabbit disney and warner signed an agreement stating that each character had the same amount of screen time in the scene similar to his animated inclusion into a liveaction film on roger rabbit mickey made a featured cameo appearance in the  television special the muppets at walt disney world where he met kermit the frog the two are established in the story as having been old friends the muppets have otherwise spoofed and referenced mickey over a dozen times since the s eventually the muppets were purchased by the walt disney company in  mickey in disneys house of mouse – his most recent theatrical cartoon short was s get a horse which was preceded by s runaway brain while from  to  he appeared in directtovideo features like mickeys once upon a christmas mickey donald goofy the three musketeers and the computeranimated mickeys twice upon a christmas many television series have centered on mickey such as the abc shows mickey mouse works – disneys house of mouse – disney channels mickey mouse clubhouse –and mickey and the roasters racers prior to all these mickey was also featured as an unseen character in the bonkers episode you oughta be in toons mickey has recently been announced to star in two films one is being based on the magic kingdom theme park at the walt disney world resort while the other is a film idea pitched by walt disney animation studios veteran burny mattinson centering on mickey donald and goofy since june   disney channel has been airing new minute mickey mouse shorts with animator paul rudish at the helm incorporating elements of mickeys late twentiesearly thirties look with a contemporary twist voice actors walt disney the cocreator of mickey mouse and founder of the walt disney company was the original voice of mickey a large part of mickeys screen persona is his famously shy falsetto voice from  onward mickey was voiced by walt disney himself a task in which disney took great personal pride however by  disney was becoming too busy with running the studio to do regular voice work which meant he could not do mickeys voice anymore it is also speculated that his cigarette habit had damaged his voice over the years after recording the mickey and the beanstalk section of fun and fancy free mickeys voice was handed over to veteran disney musician and actor jimmy macdonald macdonald voiced mickey in the remainder of the theatrical shorts and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in the mids although walt voiced mickey again for the introductions to the original – run of the mickey mouse club tv series and the fourth anniversary show episode of the disneyland tv series aired on september   composer carl w stalling was the very first person to provide lines for mickey in the  short the karnival kid clarence nash voiced mickey in the  disney short the dognapper around the time when it was filmed walt was traveling in europe and was unavailable to record his lines for mickey for the short along with disney j donald wilson joe twerp and john hiestan provided the voice in  broadcasts of the mickey mouse theater of the air stan freberg voiced mickey in the frebergproduced record mickey mouses birthday party alan young voiced mickey in the disneyland record album an adaptation of dickens christmas carol performed by the walt disney players in  which it would be the first and only time that alan young voices him the  short film mickeys christmas carol marked the theatrical debut of the late wayne allwine as mickey mouse who was the voice of mickey until his death in  allwine once recounted something macdonald had told him about voicing mickey the main piece of advice that jim gave me about mickey helped me keep things in perspective he said just remember kid you’re only filling in for the boss and that’s the way he treated doing mickey for years and years from walt and now from jimmy allwine would eventually marry russi taylor the voice

daily strip created by floyd gottfredson and published december  mickey first appeared in comics after he had appeared in  commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public walt disney was approached by king features syndicate with the offer to license mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip disney accepted and mickey made his first comic strip appearance on january   the comical plot was credited to disney himself art to ub iwerks and inking to win smith the first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of plane crazy

island animation historian jim korkis notes after the eighteenth strip iwerks left and his inker win smith continued drawing the gagaday format in early  after iwerks departure disney was at first content to continue scripting the mickey mouse comic strip assigning the art to win smith however disneys focus had always been in animation and smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script draw and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation disney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the studio he selected floyd gottfredson a recently hired employee at the time gottfredson was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment disney had to assure him the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation gottfredson accepted and ended up holding this temporary assignment from may   to november   walt disneys last script for the strip appeared may   gottfredsons first task was to finish the storyline disney had started on april   the storyline was completed on september   and later reprinted in comic book form as mickey mouse in death valley this early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included mickey and minnie among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were clarabelle cow horace horsecollar and black pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer sylvester shyster and minnies uncle mortimer mouse the death valley narrative was followed by mr slicker and the egg robbers first printed between september  and december   which introduced marcus mouse and his wife as minnies parents starting with these two early comic strip stories mickeys versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other while disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy the comic strip
