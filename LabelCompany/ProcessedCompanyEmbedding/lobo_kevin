and failure to institute measures in prevention of recurrence of these and other problems the final warning letter sent april  cites issues at the firms hopkinton ma biotechnology facility again issues relate to quality and noncompliance including falsification of documents relevant to the selling of products to hospitals which are to be sold under a limited governmentmandated basis stryker maintains that employees involved in the falsification of documents have since been terminated in the fall of  stryker along with the related companies biomet zimmer holdings depuy orthopaedics and smith  nephew were involved in civil ligation with the us department of health and human services office of inspector general this litigation called for a net payout of  million as the governmental department maintains the aforementioned companies engaged in unlawful kickbacks to physicians who urged hospitals to purchase their respective products stryker however having cooperated early in the investigation was not fined as of february  a dispute exists between stryker corp and the us department of justice concerning a subpoena linking the company to aforementioned misconduct in sale of products since governmental filing of the injunction stryker notes that it has produced in excess of  pages of documentation in compliance with the mandate us government counters however that the documentation was not proper in scope and format law officials expect the investigation to continue for several months stryker recalled several models of medical vacuums sold under the neptune waste management system brand in june and september  the devices some of which had not been cleared by the food and drug administration caused a fatal accident when the vacuum was mistakenly used to suction

  orthopedics   stryker ceo how we are innovating now stryker ceo how we are innovating now posted in orthopedics by arundhati parmar on april   share kevin lobo addresses how the concept of innovation has changed in medtech and the bets that stryker has taken along the way  arundhati parmar   kevin lobo is a passionate man he speaks quickly and with determination his fingers drumming upon the desk in front of him to stress the salient points he is making when you try to convince him to see your perspective he takes your point explains why he thinks it makes little sense and leaves you feeling surprisingly unrejected in a wideranging interview at the annual meeting of the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons in orlando in march lobo addressed innovation—a subject that is of paramount importance in medtech at a time when the ground beneath is shifting rapidly “in the old days we were a feature benefit company just like everyone else—make me a better one of these and charge a premium price” he said of what innovation meant in the recent past “those days are over” that realization made stryker take a radical decision about its triathlon total knee replacement implant a few years ago here’s how lobo recalled it in a slightly edited version at the time we made a gutsy decision i was interviewed on october    at the cleveland clinic and there was an aggressive interviewer he asked “when’s your new knee going to come out” i said ‘i dont even have one in development’ there were  people in the audience that gasped—literally gasped—when i said that he said  “you’re going to lose” and i said “no we’re not  when critics pointed out that strykers two biggest competitors were launching new knees lobo countered with ours is the most proven on the market” so stryker stuck to its guns deciding to innovate somewhere else albeit with an innovation driven by an acquisition “what have we done instead is we acquired mako to innovate on the procedure which is now a robotic instrument” lobo said stryker bought mako surgical in  for about  billion lobo firmly believes that this surgical robotic platform will improve joint replacement procedures for both surgeons and patients following the acquisition stryker’s joint replacement products are being moved to the robotic system a total hip and partial knee is already available and lobo expects to launch the triathlon knee on mako next year even though fda has already blessed this integration while acquiring mako was a process innovation stryker has been doing product innovations too the kalamazoo mi company has leveraged d printing to make components for the triathlon knee “we have launched a brand new d printed tibial base plate which enables cementless knee procedures” lobo said adding that the device is made of porous titanium and enables bone fixation in fact stryker is so sold on the promise of d printing that the company is building a d manufacturing plant in ireland aside from aiming to innovate on how joint replacements are done stryker is also engaging in business model innovation this is a move that slowly larger medtech are getting on board with in late march stryker announced that it is offering a moneyback guarantee for its patient safety technology which prevents the error of retained surgical instruments in patients undergoing surgery stryker is giving hospitals up to  million and additional refunds if its surgicount  system fails to account for every surgical sponge used during surgery  “that’s something we have never done before” lobo said of the moneyback guarantee “i am wide open to riskbased contracting i think the future is going to have lots of it” arundhati parmar is senior editor at mddi reach her at arundhatiparmarubmcom  and on
