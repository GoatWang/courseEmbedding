by researchers the company provides its rodent models to various clients across the world including pharmaceutical companies a range of biotechnology companies and various government agencies hospitals and academic institutions as of december   the company had its production facilities located in eight countries the companys research models include standard stocks and strains and disease models such as those with immune systems which are in demand as earlystage research tools the companys research models are bred and maintained in a range of controlled environments which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort research resultsthe companys research models include outbred which are purposefully bred for heterogeneity inbred which are bred to be homogeneous spontaneous mutant whose genotype results in a naturally occurring genetic mutation such as immune deficiency hybrid which are the offspring of two various inbred parents and other genetically modified research models such as knockout models with one or more disabled genes and transgenic models certain of its research models are diseasespecific rodent models used to research treatments for diseases such as diabetes obesity cardiovascular and kidney disease the company is also a provider of
