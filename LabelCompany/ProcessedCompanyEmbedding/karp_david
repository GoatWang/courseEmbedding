main story photo credit photo illustration by clang set design cindy sandmann it’s been said by steve jobs no less that good design is not just about how a thing looks but rather about how a thing works but maybe design is also about how a thing feelsthe design of tumblr the blogging tool and social network is guided by feeling in particular the feelings of david karp the company’s yearold founder whose instincts tend to run counter to current web conventions tumblr does not display “follower” counts for example or other numerical markers of popularity that are viewed as crucial socialmedia features because karp finds them “really gross” the culture of public friendandfollow reciprocity that theoretically expands a social networking service can in his view “really poison a whole community”possibly such a view of internet culture could be arrived at by way of deliberate study of online group behavior but that’s not how tumblr was made “david built it for himself” john maloney until recently the company’s president told me marco arment karp’s first employee who participated directly in the service’s creation put it even more succinctly “tumblr is david”i met karp in tumblr’s offices in the flatiron district in new york in his standard uniform of jack purcell sneakers dark pants and a hoodie over a patterned shirt karp was polite upbeat inclusive and big on eye contact asked a question about competitors he answered “the last thing we want to do is compete with someone that’s for bankers” karp likes to talk about tumblr less as a business than as a “platform for creativity” and indeed it has been used to make more than  million blogs — among them a visual scrapbook kept by michael stipe silly memeblogs like hey girl it’s paul ryan and the clever graphic analysis that became the recent book “i love charts” — drawing a combined  billion page views a month advertisement continue reading the main story the trick is making page views equal money “pretty much every large tech company today” karp said is essentially “metrics driven” google twitter facebook they’re obsessed with “optimizing” services design functionality and aesthetics through constant testing and tweaking that ability to optimize and not incidentally monetize user experiences by reacting to microlevel data is the essence of webbusiness magic as it is generally understood continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story karp chose not to operate that way rather than monetizing clicks he wants advertisers to view tumblr as a place to promote particularly creative campaigns to an audience whose attention is worth paying for it’s an approach that may or may not guide tumblr into the black but karp isn’t worried his niceyoungman aspect makes it easy to miss the brashness of what he is saying he isn’t interested in competing but not because he doesn’t like competition he just feels that he sees something everyone else has missedtrying to blog at first made david karp feel bad that big empty text box seemed to demand a lot of carefully constructed words an intimidating sight for a nonwriter the first iteration of tumblr was a tool for “tumblelogging” a shortform variation on blogging designed to make it easier and less offputting it was released in  and tech crunch promptly praised its simplicity “there is absolutely no learning curve”like any blogging tool tumblr allows users to design a site from a behindthescenes “dashboard” where you type a post or upload a photo and choose a visual “theme” tumblr’s dashboard incorporates some familiar elements of social web services in addition to making your own posts you can “follow” or appreciate those of other tumblr users you can repost images and other content onto your own blog easily and this helped tumblr develop a reputation as a more visually oriented multimedia version of twitter photo three of david karp’s favorite tumblrs from top humans of new york from me to you looper in the beginning most traffic came to tumblr from without but now more than  percent of the traffic on tumblr occurs in the dashboard zone where users read react to and repurpose one another’s posts the upshot is “the mullet theory of social software design” summarizes chris muscarella a techentrepreneur friend of karp’s “it’s all business in the front you have your blog that looks like any other blog although usually prettier and then the real party is in the back through the social interaction on the dashboard”the features tumblr eliminates are as important to the way it feels as those it adopts bijan sabet of spark capital an early tumblr investor who sits on its board says that it is “normal behavior” for a founder to be excited about adding new bells and whistles but karp seems excited about doing the opposite “he’ll tell us ‘hey got a new version coming up — and i took four features out’ ”karp’s thinking about the comments section which is generally assumed to be a core blog feature helps illustrate his broader ideas about how design shapes behavior online typically a youtube video or blog post or article on a newspaper’s site is the dominant object with comments strewed below it buried like so much garbage thus many commenters feel they must scream to be noticed and do so in all caps profanely and with maximum hyperbole this karp argues brings out the worst in people so tumblr’s design does not include a comments sectionhow then to encourage feedback while discouraging driveby hecklers who make you never want to post again first karp notes you can comment on someone else’s post by reblogging it and adding your reaction but that reaction appears on your tumblr not the one you’re commenting on “so if you’re going to be a jerk you’re looking like a jerk in your own space and my space is still pristine” karp explains this makes for a thoughtful network and encourages expression and ultimately creativity “that’s how you can design to make a community more positive” advertisement continue reading the main story another example when users wanted a private message system tumblr’s answer involved clicking on the words “send fan mail” — a prompt to encourage positivity “we don’t want to allow you to have your feelings hurt on tumblr” zack sultan a tumblr designer sayskarp is even more expansive in his claims for the emotional goals for tumblr’s design to express approval without reblogging users click a heart icon it’s easy and upbeat and replaces the “garbage little omgs and lols” in a traditional comment section with “much more orderly little hearts” he says this feature on tumblr slightly predates “liking” on facebook and a semiotics thesis could be written on the communicative implications of the thumbs up vs the heartwhen he explains tumblr karp breaks its users into three groups the first is he concedes the smallest but it’s the one he emphasizes the most the “creators” who post their own photographs original writing and so on then there are the “curators” who cull heart and reblog the best of this material for the benefit of the biggest group the “consumers” in reality a lot of what is curated and consumed on tumblr originated elsewhere but at least some of it was made on the platform this karp argues makes tumblr distinct from say pinterest the lately hot service that is associated with gathering and highlighting material from around the web not that karp sees pinterest as competition he says that a lot of what’s on pinterest comes from tumblr and helps drive his traffic more to the point karp asserts that tumblr was built for creative people to create things and for those more interested in sharing or discovering it’s a system built for positive reinforcement “everybody loves everybody” he concludes “through the chain”karp is the kind of new yorker who is so conditioned to the orderly street grid of the upper west side of manhattan where he grew up that he finds the west village a little disorienting his mother teaches science at the progressive calhoun school and his father is a composer for television and film they separated when karp was  he has a younger brother kevin who studies literature at suny stony brook as a kid karp was interested in technology but until the end of the summer after his freshman year at bronx science one of the city’s more prestigious public schools nothing really distinguished his experiencethe change began with an act of empathy karp was fooling around on his computer one day when his mother came into his room and asked how he was feeling about going back to school actually she knew the answer and he knew that she knew he hadn’t been particularly engaged with his classes his teachers or his fellow students but he couldn’t get enough of the internship he worked at all summer still he was surprised at what she said next perhaps he would prefer not to go back at all and instead be homeschooled and more crucially continue the internship photo david karp the founder of tumblr and his dog clark gpoy gratuitous picture of yourself is a popular tumblr tag credit photo illustration by clang set design cindy sandmann the internship was at frederator studios an animation production company partly focused on the web and founded by fred seibert a veteran of mtv and hannabarbera seibert’s children went to calhoun and his wife was friendly with karp’s mother “he was a typical yearold” seibert recalls “he couldn’t quite look you in the eye” the exception his fluency talking to frederator’s coders and engineers seibert was impressed even though he acknowledges “i had no idea what they were talking about none” when an entrepreneur named john maloney sought technical help with his startup urbanbabycom a frederator employee recommended karp the project had to be done in a couple of days karp did it in four hours maloney made him urbanbaby’s head of product and gave him a bit of equity he was karp never got around to earning a highschool diploma cnet bought urbanbaby and karp started his own company davidville envisioning a mix of client work and original products he put an ad on craigslist seeking another engineer “what do i do when someone actually responds to this thing” he recalls worrying “i have to like meet this person” he persuaded seibert to join him when he interviewed marco arment the engineer who appliedarment just two years out of college was slightly confused about who his boss would be but he chose davidville over an offer from bloomberg during a weeklong lull in client work they decided to build the tumblelogging tool that karp had dreamed up replacing the features on the traditional blogging dashboard with six big buttons illustrated with taskspecific icons text photo video link quote and dialogue this ancillary project took on a life of its own soon karp heard from bijan sabet of spark capital and after some initial resistance decided to put aside everything else spark union square ventures and a small group of angel investors put up a combined  valuing tumblr at  million karp brought in john maloney his exboss from urbanbaby to handle business matters while he focused on tumblr’s design and functionality and arment who left in  to focus on his own startup instapaper oversaw the knottier engineering challenges newsletter sign up continue reading the main

socialization process of high school and college would turn out to have such insightful behavioraldesign intuition karp’s friend chris muscarella suggests that because karp never had that familiar experience “he has very little notion of what it means to be a conformist” or to measure his thinking against abstract conventional wisdom advertisement continue reading the main story karp did operate in social contexts of course he grew up on the early internet and fondly recalls the chat rooms and messaging and games from the period “when aol was really in its prime” he also learned early how to interact with adults like a peer but he gives the most credit to his parents as unconditional “enablers” his father michael karp exposed him to a variety of geeky gadgetry at a young age and prodded him to pursue the seibert internship and i was more than a little surprised at how many people insisted that i needed to meet his mother barbara ackermanwhen i did meet her ackerman greeted me with a hug and we walked to a pizza place in the upper west side neighborhood where she has lived since leaving her native california in the s of course she says people have questioned why she — a teacher — would suggest that her son opt out of high school david seemed less social than his younger brother always holed up with his computer ackerman explained but uncommonly sure of himself his parents could tell that he was far more engaged in his work at seibert’s office than in school she recalls feeling the sense of relief through her hand on her son’s shoulder when she floated the ideakarp remembers needing “a few minutes” to wonder about what he’d miss out on in high school before concluding “yeah it sounds like a dream”like lots of socalled web  companies tumblr is now reckoning with the very bankerish concern of figuring out how to make money it has tried over the last five years to do so by selling tools that allowed users to snazz up their blogs or promote posts but efforts like those haven’t generated nearly enough cash to offset its expenses — let alone justify the  million valuation suggested by its most recent round of venturecapital investment last yearshortly before facebook’s initial public offering karp started talking about making money from advertising — which seemed to run counter to a declaration he made in  that advertising “really turns our stomachs” then again pretty much every social network chieftain including mark zuckerberg seems sour on ads until the moment they start making ads the center of their entire business video timescast tech  tumblrs david karp the yearold founder of the popular blog site shares his inspiration and mistakes by jeremy beiler and emily b hager on publish date july    watch in times video » embed around this time i had dinner with karp and his girlfriend rachel eakley karp was reflective about how his role at tumblr was changing he had not he confessed ruefully “committed code” in about six months for years tumblr was made up of a handful of mostly young guys who could knock out a site redesign and head off to lunch together a smallenough group to fit in an elevator as with many earlystage web startups the focus was on the product and the user base not money “i didn’t care how the bills got paid or about facilities or hr stuff” karp saidfor a time karp popped up with some regularity on blogs that gossip about the social antics of young new york internet hotshots that ended a couple of years ago when he started dating eakley who has just finished a master’s degree in psychology and is starting nursing school in the fall they live with their dog and are remodeling a loft in williamsburg that said his life is not exactly normal he often commutes on one of his three motorcycles one of which has a sidecar when he talks about dealing with critics he mentions advice he got from john mayer the musician when they had an impromptu dinner at a rooftop hotel restaurant in tokyo when he vacationed in the virgin islands he stopped by richard branson’s island to hang out they met last year and branson became a tumblr investor somehow he manages to pass along such anecdotes in a way that makes them relatablei sat in on the “all team” meeting karp recently implemented as a fridayafternoon ritual i agreed to keep certain details confidential but it was clear that karp is thinking pretty hard about profitability tumblr has learned to assemble some data that advertisers want and that it had previously not bothered to collect notable features of the meeting included a new system for measuring the effectiveness of various departments advertisement continue reading the main story after a hiring binge over the past nine months or so tumblr now has more than  employees in may maloney stepped down from his role as president he and karp say the move was in the works for months — a combination of karp’s increased interest in the business side a stronger crew of experienced managers and maloney’s lack of interest in running an established company maloney remains on the board if karp is worried about taking on more responsibilities it doesn’t show i asked him if given tumblr’s significant burn rate he was perhaps a little more stressed out than he let on “for whatever reason i’m not” he replied in the past year he has become engaged with the challenge of designing not just a product but a business it’s quite distinct from the zen experience of solitary problemsolving that is coding but he continued “i’ve really gotten a kick out of trying to make running a company as zen an experience as it can be”he seemed particularly enthusiastic in fact about advertising that old quote about it turning his stomach was he says imprecise it’s specifically web advertising as we know it that he opposes “the web has megaoptimized the smallest chunk of advertising which is direct response” he continued and that’s fine for say an online electronics retailer but it doesn’t do much to enable the kind of creative advertising that is “intended to make you feel something for the brand” that’s what the ad industry was built on and it’s what people remember he says “can you remember the last twitter ad you’ve seen the last facebook ad” and so he concludes there is a huge untapped opportunity not that he’s interested in competing you understand he just has a feeling this is something everyone else has missedkarp has said tumblr could be “wildly profitable” overnight by simply incorporating conventional online ads into the platform but he believes that would spoil the community and the creativity that have taken shape there his proposed solution entails advertisers’ being just as creative and expressive as tumblr users for now that means that a spot on the tumblr dashboard generally used to highlight the company’s picks for the coolest stuff happening in its network will include occasional content from paid sponsors the first participants included adidas calvin klein and the movie “beasts of the southern wild” generating more than  in revenue within a monththis strategy means a brand must use tumblr and use it well — which actually lots of brands already do free in fact tumblr helped many of them do so — again free — during the years it was more concerned with boosting its audience than with making money karp argues that this is a strength “a lot of these brands showed up on tumblr figured out how to use the tools created value for our community and got a response” now they have the option to “elevate” what they’ve created within tumblr by way of a sponsorship this scheme is not instantly convincing given the degree to which it breezily marginalizes thinking that has built some multibilliondollar enterprises and brought plenty of others to their knees online advertising’s highly specific targeting and measurable results are seen as its great advantage over traditional advertising capable of delivering the unquantifiable emotional payoff karp is talking aboutkarp acknowledges all this but points out that the emphasis on feeling over data is exactly what made tumblr popular sometimes he admits his investors push him on this subject “but i think i can make a pretty good case for — ” uncharacteristically he stopped and gazed at the floor karp is rarely at a loss for smoothly delivered words but now he seemed to be searching for something precise he started and stopped again and then said what it is he believes in “following our hearts” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your

taught himself to code and dropped out of high school now karp runs his company his wayand refuses to keep a schedule by liz welch liz welch is a national magazine awardwinning journalist who has written for the new york times real simple glamour and inc among other publications she is the coauthor with her siblings of the recent book the kids are all right a highly regarded memoir of her childhood lizmwelch coauthor the kids are all right lizmwelch  comments enjoying the ride david karp often commutes to the office on his vespa credit michael lewis michael lewis away from the computer tumblr lets users share their thoughts online but karp prefers to jot his ideas for the company on paper in  when others his age were studying for midterms and living on dorm food david karp was busy launching tumblr an easytouse blogging platform that now hosts  million blogs and receives about  billion page views per week the company has also attracted some  million in venture funding karp  is used to doing his own thing at  he taught himself how to write code at  he dropped out of high school a year later he got a job as cto of urbanbaby a new york city parenting site at tumblr karp likes to spend his time sketching ideas in notebooks lunching as a group with his  employees and of course perusing blogs on tumblr one thing he doesnt like is being pinned down that quickly becomes clear if you try to make an appointment with him or happen to spot him zipping around new york city on his vespa im very antischedule except for board meetings i dont really schedule things or keep a calendar i think appointments are caustic to creativity its so frustrating when youre in the middle of a great conversation or work groove and you realize oh ive got an appointment ive got to bolt i prefer the lets just call each other when we need something or want to hang out approach that way i never have to cancel on people which is always a bummer people tell me i need an assistant but i dont want one i live in manhattan about  minutes from my office in the morning i usually walk to work or take my vespa i got it in october and i love it ive always wanted a motorcycle and i thought a vespa was a good first step its a lot cheaper than cabs for getting around the city it costs  to fill it up and a tank of gas lasts all week i try hard not to check emails until i get to the office which is usually between  and  am reading emails at home never feels good or productive if something urgently needs my attention someone will call or text me i used to suck at email id let emails pile up get overwhelmed and miss important messagesor forget to reply so i set up filters on my email and thats been working pretty well now my inbox gets emails only from people in my company and from my girlfriend a folder called robots gets anything not written by a human like bank statements and google alerts most everything else goes into the unsorted folder when i get to the office i go through my inbox first and try to respond right away then i go through my unsorted folder but i respond to very few of those ive found that if youre not responsive to email it trains people to leave you alone as i go through my email i make a list of things that i need to do that day in my notebook i have a bad memory so ive become a thorough note taker i use action method notebooks from a company called behance they are really beautiful the pages have rows of dots instead of lines i ordered a bunch for our team i always write with a pilot precise v pen its inky but doesnt smudge in addition to todo lists i also use the notebooks to sketch out ideas for new features on tumblr the notebooks are big so it takes me four to six months to fill one up i keep all of the old ones in a drawer every monday morning we have an allteam meeting in our conference room a place i designed to be quiet and cozy there are no conference tablesjust a couch and a few comfortable chairs our customer support team a group of eight people in virginia attends via skype i started holding these meetings in january as a way for everyone to get up to speed on what everyone else is doing the first few meetings were pretty awkward i tend to get excited and ramble on so ive been trying to go around the room and have everyone else talk about the projects theyre working on i still probably talk too much our office is a big open loft space and im right in the middle the engineers who run the site are clustered on one side of me and the community outreach teamthe company evangelists who interact with our usersis on the other side people are really quiet and respectful of one another i use headphones if i listen to music we mostly use email to communicate i love email because it doesnt interrupt anyone the fewer distractions the better i have two screens on my desk the first is a inch mac monitor i always have tumblr open in the web browser the second is a vertical screen which i use only for writing code you can turn most dell or hewlettpackard monitors sideways a trick i learned from marco arment who used to be tumblrs lead developer i like using two screens because if you do everything on the same monitor you end up constantly flipping back and forth between programs which is distracting a lot of our engineers have the same setup now im on tumblr all day i dont follow a ton of people but i post and reblog stuff i really care about i love my blog i get most of my news from my tumblr dashboard i used to be a hour news consumer but so much of the reporting is bad these days i find tech reporting incredibly tedious and dull and ive kind of given up on reading anything that anyone writes about tumblr its often inaccurate i used to spend all day coding but that changed when we hired engineers who were a lot smarter than me i still jump in to help code as needed the engineers have scrums every day occasionally ill sit in on their meetings to get a sense of whats going on and see if i can help with anything im really good at asking questions about edge cases or unusual scenarios so when our engineers are describing a new way to build something ill ask what if its in a different language or will it get totally messed up if that button has to be a different dimension basically what part of this arent we thinking about we roll out changes to the site every day at  am we stagger out small changes so we can see what works and what doesnt we chose that time because we want engineers around if theres an issue plus its early enough that theres not much traffic basically everything that was finished the day before gets pushed the next morning it could be a bug fix or a new language filesay a feature that was translated into french or it could be a new feature thats dark launchedthe public cant see it but we have the ability to test it after we launch a new feature i keep a close eye on how many people are using it if its unpopular well discontinue it and try something else every feature has some maintenance cost and having fewer features lets us focus on the ones we care about and make sure they work very well for every new feature we add we take an old one out a lot of big sites dont do that and its a problem twitter started as a beautifully simple product but its now going the same route as facebook the drive to innovate can overencumber and destroy a product my goal is to keep tumblr very focused theres kind of a hive mentality at the office we all break for lunch between  and  usually one person gets up and the rest follow we all cram into the elevator once we hit the street we break off into two or three groups and go get food to bring back to the office then we all eat together i always carry my camera with me in january i bought my dream camera a leica m its the smallest digital camera they make with a full sensor i post lots of photos on my blog and i actually took most of the tumblr employee photos i dont do much of the hiring anymore each department is in charge of hiring its own members i like autonomous people i want people who can take a project and figure out how to do it themselves i dont really care about how things get done only that they get done lately ive been focused on our community outreach teamits responsible for figuring out how to connect with and promote the people who use tumblr i recently brought in my friend richard tong to be our fashion editor he started weardrobe a fashion website that is now owned by google about  percent of our blogs are fashion related and he focuses on reaching out to that demographic as a result tumblr had a huge presence at new yorks fashion week i meet with the community team at least once a week to brainstorm about ways we can connect with users like sponsoring a literary event or organizing meetups for tumblr users around the world i love that part of my job usually around  pm i need a pickmeup a handful of us will pop out for tea at a place around the corner i either order an iced tea or an armenian mint tea i used to drink coffee but it messes me upi have a very fast metabolism so i go from drowsy to unbearably hyper tea has just the right amount of caffeine in the afternoons i usually want to bury my head in some projecteither screwing around with design or coding something recently i took a stab at redesigning our photo sets feature which lets users post several photos together like a slide show i may spend a couple of hours scraping together my thoughts before sending an idea out to the product team to get their take on it one or two nights a week i usually work lateuntil  or  when i do i like to see who is still in the office and then take them out for dinner as a way to say thank you we are surrounded by great restaurants so we go somewhere nice i rarely work on weekends unless theres a serious database or infrastructure emergency the company is growing fast and weve had some problems scaling any time we add capacity it immediately fills up in december the site was down for an entire day it happened on a sundaythere was a whole lot of scrambling to figure out what broke everything about it sucked one of my favorite things to do on the weekend is take road trips i just joined the classic car club in manhattan you pay an annual fee which gives you access to all these cool cars my girlfriend and i took a  porsche  carrera s up to montreal one weekend it was amazing weve also taken trips to boston and maine other times well jump on the vespa and drive around the city we might have brunch at our favorite place in the east village then pop over to see friends in brooklyn before heading back up to union square to see a movie i spend a lot of time with people who work at tumblr but i make a very poor effort to hang out with other people in my life im trying to do a better job of that but honestly i love quiet nights at home my girlfriend is a spectacular chef she usually cooks dinner for us two or three nights out of the week and then we wind down by watching tv we use apple tv to watch television shows from itunes we both love futurama i recently got her into top gear a car show on the bbc sleep is precious to me im very disappointed if i dont go to bed before midnight we have a rule no laptops in the bedroom being on computers all the time makes me feel gross check out incs

here’s what celebrities would look like with symmetrical faces tumblrs plan to reach owner company yahoo ceos marissa mayers vision of becoming a business with  million in revenue by next year isnt to take on other internet giants like facebook and twitter for advertising money instead the blogging platform wants to steal ad money from tv broadcasters and newspaper and magazine publishers tumblr ceo david karp told the financial times tumblr is on a mission to prove to advertisers that it is the best platform for aspirational marketing campaigns which are typically placed on tv or in premium glossy magazines the financial times report suggests tumblr doesn’t just want to be speaking to the digital agencies it wants to be forming partnerships with the top creatives and marketers behind bigbrand super bowl ads karp told ft that while the rest of the industry was focused on direct response advertising — when consumers are likely to be on the lookout for one particular product and are served with a buy me now ad — and narrow targeting that uses data to show ads based on very strict sets of criteria tumblr offers advertisers a broader base of interests that is why he thinks tumblr is the best place for brand marketing campaigns online he said in the interview the whole industry is obsessed with harvesting intent when if you look at the biggest brands they want to create intent to get people to aspire to wear the clothes drive the car drink the soda right now there arent a lot of pleas in any of these digital networks which inspire people to become a customer … which they used to do with great tv and print campaigns the general message to big brands and agencies from silicon valley and all the digital networks is leave the creative people at home show up with the data scientists we want them to show up with the guys putting together the super bowl ads one of the advantages of tumblr over facebook or twitter karp says is that people come to tumblr with the intent to consume content rather than to communicate with their friends so in that way the sites sponsored posts radar posts and trending blogs ad formats are not a jarring surprise that take you away from your very personal place karp added yahoo acquired tumblr for  billion last year however many observers have criticized the move as the acquisition does not appear to be immediately paying off however in

by marco braca at kramer  kramer tumblr founded  age of ceo  number of tumblr users  million lesson youth can be worth more than  billion to a twentyyearold internet company in midmay a few days before yahoo announced it would be acquiring tumblr there was a housewarming party in greenpoint a tumblr employee was moving into an apartment with a friend who happened to be dating another �tumblr employee and the overlapping social circles resulted in a room full of tumblr people it was saturday night late the previous afternoon a cluster of posts had appeared on tech blogs with the announcement that yahoo’s board would be meeting on sunday to approve a  billion offer for tumblr and though everyone at the party had read the posts�or fielded texts from someone who had�nobody had really paid attention rumors skittered around the office on a weekly basis employees always joked that it didn’t matter what kind of options you had because tumblr was never going to sell plus yahoo really when a similar idea circulated back in  tumblr’s then�lead developer marco arment summed up the party line in a scornful blog post �i hope they let me work on some of the many exciting projects at yahoo � i want to move to california and get stuck in traffic every day on the way to my midlevel engineering job where i sit in a cubicle all day and can’t make any product decisions while working on something nobody will ever see to manage regional ad clickthrough stats tracking� thanks but no thanks yahoo was a lumbering sunnyvale company with irrelevant products that no one used tumblr was a nimble startup in the nation’s greatest city with a boygenius founder an acquisition wasn’t just unlikely it was insulting the only company to whom they might have sold an early employee said was apple if apple had asked yahoo’s reputation as a wet blanket may have been allayed by the arrival of marissa mayer as ceo but an acquisition still struck employees at the party as too icky to be true one guest summed it up �no one who works in tech wants to work at yahoo� as more wine and whiskey were consumed however the incredulity turned into fidgety speculation one employee pointed out that mayer had been dropping into the tumblr office as far back as december he remembered peering into the fishbowl conference room to see her meeting with their ceo david karp and head of product derek gottfrid nothing secret about it other employees were aware that after a hiring spree and floortoceiling office remodel the amount of cash left in �tumblr’s coffers was dwindling at some point partygoers who worked on the engineering side began forecasting how shitty the company would become if yahoo were to buy it and by the end of the night guests were running numbers trying to figure out how much their options might be worth on monday karp called an allteam meeting to announce the deal if low and mid and even some highlevel employees were shocked��i don’t think anyone saw it coming necessarily� says gottfrid�anyone paying attention to tumblr’s burn rate should have been expecting an exit despite its popularity it is the fourteenthmostvisited site in the us according to quantcast a few slots above wikipedia tumblr was a sixyearold blogging platform with disappointing revenue targets no clear path to profitability and alarmingly little cash in the bank just  million when it was purchased to stay afloat without selling it would have needed a sixth round of funding which given the situation might have led to a �down round� and to karp ceding a substantial chunk of his equity as one person watching the deal unfold put it �it was the biggest game of chicken i’ve ever seen in a startup literally months away from bankruptcy and he manages to find an angel in marissa mayer�’ on a smotheringly hot morning a few months after the acquisition tumblr’s yearold ceo took a train from the williamsburg duplex he shares with his girlfriend and bulldog into manhattan’s gramercy park neighborhood for breakfast maialino�the danny meyer version of a roman trattoria with tourists and eggwhite frittatas�is not a place karp would have chosen for a social occasion for that he prefers the brooklyn outpost of cafe mogador where he orders an �überbreakfast� of pancakes eggs florentine avocado and bacon but for workrelated meals maialino is perfect two blocks from the tumblr office

main story photo david karp tumblr’s founder in  he left bronx high school of science at  to focus on computers on his mother’s advice credit james estrinthe new york times when david karp was  he was clearly a bright teenager quiet somewhat reclusive bored with his classes at the bronx high school of science he spent most of his free time in his bedroom glued to his computerbut instead of trying to pry him away from his machine or coaxing him outside to get some fresh air his mother barbara ackerman had another solution she suggested that he drop out of high school to be homeschooled“i saw him at school all day and absorbed all night into his computer” said ms ackerman reached by phone monday afternoon “it became very clear that david needed the space to live his passion which was computers all things computers”clearlynow  years old mr karp never finished high school or enrolled in college instead he played a significant role in several technology startups before founding tumblr the popular blogging service that agreed to be sold to yahoo for  billion this week with an expected  million from the deal mr karp joins a tiny circle of something entrepreneurs hoodiewearing characters like facebook’s mark zuckerberg and foursquare’s dennis crowley who have struck it rich before turning  advertisement continue reading the main story “when i first met david he was  years old and wearing sneakers and jeans” said bijan sabet a general partner at spark capital who was one of the first people to invest in tumblr “but i knew he was one of these rare entrepreneurs that grew up on the web and who could come up with an idea build it himself and then ship it that night” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story since founding tumblr six years ago mr karp has been admired for his programming skills and web site design acumen but at times has been a polarizing figure in new york tech circles because he so often blogged about his personal life and partyhopping he has popped up in the new york post’s page six magazine and has been a recurring target for the gossip web site gawker where he was labeled a “fameball” a derogatory term for someone who has an unquenchable desire for fametall and willowy with a mop of brown hair and piercing blue eyes mr karp typically dresses in jeans a tshirt and sneakers he speaks at a rapid clip and often for minutes without stopping technically he never graduated from high school which he cracked in an interview is “hopefully not a condition of yahoo employment”after dropping out and working for a time in small new york tech outfits mr karp made his way to tokyo where he worked for several months for a startup he returned to the united states and became the chief technology officer for urbanbaby an internet message board for parents cnet networks bought urbanbaby in  and mr karp took the several hundred thousand dollars he made from the sale to start his own company called davidville one of davidville’s projects was a simple blogging service called tumblrmr karp’s run at tumblr has not been without problems he had trouble hiring in tumblr’s early days unsure how to even interview recruits he often thought large companies were too big for their own good proclaiming he could manage tumblr with a team of fourbut mr karp stepped out of the party scene and started dating his current girlfriend a graduate nursing school student at new york university four years ago he also appeared to get more serious about his company as it grew from less than a dozen employees to more than  today “david has grown up in tumblr” said mark coatney who oversees tumblr’s relationship with media companiesstill mr karp’s unsure footing led to discussions about his taking a different role at tumblr according to two people who worked with the company and who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because revenue was not growing as fast as they would have liked investors considered putting mr karp in charge of tumblr’s product development and finding a more seasoned chief executive photo david karp the founder of tumblr on monday with marissa mayer the chief executive of yahoo credit karsten moran for the new york times mr karp denied in an interview that there was a plan for him to give up the chief executive’s job he said that when tumblr’s chief operating officer left in the middle of last year filling that job and other critical roles like head of marketing was “top of mind” but he said there was no plan for him to step aside advertisement continue reading the main story like many who run socalled social internet companies mr karp can teeter on reclusive in an interview last year at the founders conference in new york he said he preferred to come to the office early to work alone avoiding other people“where i feel the most productive and engaged is when i’m buried in code buried in some project tweaking some designs” he said
