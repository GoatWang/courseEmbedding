portfoliosummaryrobots are on the risewhat industriesjobs will be most affectedhow can investors position themselves to profit protect or insure against jobs becoming obsoletereading too different for comfort by louisvincent gave i came across an interesting paragraph making sense of what type of jobs are most vulnerable to robotization • category  workers nonrepetitive noncomplex gardeners plumbers ski instructors hairdressers… these jobs are not in danger and will likely continue to be the largest source of job growth across the oecd and emerging markets • category  workers nonrepetitive complex pharmaceutical research software coding civil or mechanical engineering hedge fund managers such jobs are not in danger quite the contrary  demand will likely increase and salaries rise allowing those working in these fields to purchase more goods and services from the workers toiling in categories   and  • category  workers repetitive and complex airline pilots surgeons highly qualified industrial jobs equity traders…within the oecd these are the jobs threatened by the robolution • category  workers repetitive very simple manufacturing jobs lowend farming jobs etc… think charlie chaplin in the movie modern times such jobs have already disappeared in the oecd  they will now disappear in emerging markets for clarity i put mr gaves thinking into a graphical model noncomplex complex nonrepetitive cat  gardeners plumbers ski instructors hair dressers cat  pharmaceutical research software coding civil or mechanical engineering hedge fund managers repetitive cat  manufacturing low end farming jobs cat  airline pilots surgeons highly qualified industrial jobs equity traders if you are young or you have kids it is already a revolutionary idea they may not be best off going through university to end up with a cat  job it may actually be much better to go for a cat  job while they save a lot of money on student loans superinteresting… but how does this apply to investing in robotics stock there is a quote out there somewhere by a vc or a successful serial entrepreneur i dont know which one and i cant remember the quote very well because an hour of google searches didnt turn it up the question is what he looks for starting a business he answers something like i look for industries with a lot of jobs and see if i can kill them if you know the exact quote andor who said it please help me out in the comments its a brutal way to go about your daily business but i guess he found it a reliable model to come up with good investmentsbusiness plans we can borrow this train of thought and couple it with the lvg model to get to an interesting investment set look for firms with an abundance of category  and  employees these firms are positioned well to expand their margins the most when robots become cheaper and improve in terms of profiting from the robo revolution ideal investment candidates would have at least several of the following characteristics subject to a high degree of labour protection regulation low enterprise valueemployee count highly robust employees are not an intrinsic part of the product subject to massive labour protection regulation it seems counterintuitive to look for candidates in countries with massive labour protection regulation admittedly management will switch to robotization last because the initial savings will be the least however a pool of labour that is highly protected is likely to be very inefficient to begin with in addition robotization may well be one of these trends where theres a last mover advantage the first few firms to invest are buying very expensive robots that over time are still worth it initially that puts pressure on the remaining firms who havent robotized but when these switch to robotization a few years later and achieve greater productivity gains at lower capex the tables are turned low enterprise valuelabour cost youll want to have an investment candidate that is spending a lot on employee salaries to generate its revenues an investment based on robotization will have a higher roi the higher labour costs are compared to enterprise value on a more detailed level there will be lots of caveats but on a high level it should hold up this is a very important attribute perhaps the most important after the next two highly robust firms robots are getting better thats obvious how good do they get how cheap do they get how fast will their use spread are all questions that are still open it will be fairly easy to make the right observation but in the end still fail to profit because the firm you are counting on got disrupted itself one principal that will help you to profit from future cash flows is to bet on firms that are very hard to kill as howard marks says to finish first you must first finish employees are not an intrinsic part of the product you arent going to do very well implementing a model to profit of robotization if you pick a firm where it just wont work somewhat of a weird example and not legal in all geographies is that of an escort organisation employee costs eat up a lot of cash flow the services are noncomplex and repetitive yet im skeptical of robotization firms that could benefit from robotization by no means an exhaustive list here are eight names that have the potential to benefit from robots evolving gs plc adr gs plc adr otcpkgfszy offers security services it operates on six continents and employs  people im fairly sure not all of these men and women are about to lose their jobs but many of the roles fulfilled within this company seem fairly susceptible to automation or robotization it wont come as a surprise one man or women can already survey many locations at once through technological advancement the company could score better on robustness with ebitda at only  x net debt however the firm is taking it to x which is much better demand for security seems fairly resilient although the medium through which is delivered is always changing securitas securitas a b otcsctby does many of the same things as gs it employs  people in  countries its a little bit safer compared to gs however gs scores better on the important enterprise valueemployee metric casino guichard perrachon sa adr casino guichard perrachon sa adr otcpkcgusy a large grocery store operator with  employees as a kid ive stacked shelves and im fairly certain its a task that can and will be robotized however not all employees will disappear because of robotization when i reviewed ahold otcqxadrny a while back i was really impressed with the selfcheckout counters source as apparent from the terrible picture quality the picture is authors own if the customers can do the work themselves there is no need to invest in robots even better back to casino the firm doesnt score very well on robustness as its debt is quite high however given the ambitious plan to cut down on debt source company presentation and the resilient nature of demand for its products ive included it anyway casino isnt your only choice many retailers could be interesting candidates iss as adr iss as adr otcpkissdy a facility services company that could be interesting it offers many of the same services as the securities companies discussed earlier but also cleaning and catering services both services that are ripe for robotization compass group plc adr compass group otcpkcmpgy operates a lot of restaurants employing  people worldwide the majority of jobs in restaurants from busboy to server to chef are not immune to robotization the company is also focused on efficiency in labour costs as apparent from this slide in its investor presentation management also identified automation as a source of labour cost efficiency gains but not robotization why i wrote this up while im skeptical of prediction theres nothing preventing investors of applying a fundamental analysis methodology to a set of companies with these characteristics if the investment makes a lot of sense based on a subsequent fundamental analysis the potential optionality derived from robotization through the industry comes free as opposed to when you buy companies that are focused on robotics and where future prospects are priced in disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
