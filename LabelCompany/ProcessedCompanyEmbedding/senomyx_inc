wirethe board of directors of senomyx inc “senomyx” or the “company” snmx a leading company using proprietary taste science technologies to discover develop and commercialize novel flavor ingredients and natural high intensity sweeteners for the food beverage and flavor industries today mailed a letter to shareholders in connection with the company’s upcoming  annual meeting of shareholders to be held on may  this smart news release features multimedia view the full release here httpwwwbusinesswirecomnewshomeen the full text of the letter followsapril  dear shareholdersat the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on may   you will face a critical choice that will directly impact the future of your investment in senomyx you must decide whether to elect the slate of highlyqualified and experienced board nominees put forth by the company or the slate of nominees put forth by an activist investor group “concerned shareholders and nominees of senomyx” or “csns” that just recently purchased less than one thousandth of one percent  or  shares of senomyx stockas we have previously stressed we believe that your investment in the company will be put at extreme risk should you make the decision to give complete control of the board to a group that owns such a miniscule amount of senomyx shares and that has not presented a plan for how its members would improve the company and lead it forward additionally we believe that the backgrounds and track records of many members of the dissident group call into question whether they have the requisite experience skillset and independence to truly represent your best interestsin order to protect your investment and ensure that senomyx remains on a path of maximum value creation we urge you to elect the seasoned and experienced nominees put forth by your companylet’s look at the facts when comparing your company’s nominees and the dissidentsyour board has articulated a clear strategic vision for the future of senomyx and is intensely focused on executing initiatives to drive shareholder value secured  million in development funding and is committed to securing additional nondilutive funding for key program initiatives focused on opportunities to collaborate on a nonexclusive basis with leading companies as part of a broader strategy to optimize the commercial potential of products from its natural sweet program recently secured  million in rd funding from pepsico in order to advance the company’s natural sweet program and is in discussions with approximately  companies to collaborate and secure additional rd funding senomyx has also focused on expense reductions and implemented a restructuring in december of  resulting in an annualized savings of approximately  million the company has narrowed the focus of its sweet taste rd efforts to the natural sweet program in response to market trends your board has demonstrated recent positive momentum and financial results in line with current strategic initiatives oversaw strong yearoveryear growth in the fiscal year ended  and continued strong results in  commercial revenues were up  and delivered high gross margins at  achieved continued direct sales revenue growth with q  direct sales reaching more than double the previous highestsales quarter since the company began its initiative to extend its reach in the marketplace senomyx has demonstrated a history of discovering and advancing product candidates into the development phase most recently senomyx advanced its lead natural high intensity sweetener siratose into the development phase while we don’t believe that the market fairly reflects the value of senomyx stock we are confident that our strategy will drive longterm value for shareholders your board has the right experience to provide effective oversight at senomyx and has adhered to principles of good corporate governance has necessary industry experience at companies in relevant sectors including food and beverage flavor and ingredient and pharmaceutical and life sciences has an extensive history of director and executive leadership at both public and private companies in relevant industries five senomyx directors have served on the board of directors for publicly traded companies which have been acquired for over  billion in each sale your board is aligned with shareholders’ best interests owns over  shares  of senomyx demonstrating alignment with and prioritization of the best interests of shareholders has been transparent about strategic initiatives at senomyx which are aligned with the best interests of all shareholders to create lasting value at the company the dissidents have failed to articulate any sort of plan and have already made repeated missteps with less than a month to go before the annual meeting the dissident group has failed to share a strategic plan for the company with shareholders they have provided only a  word boiler plate statement that summarizes basic steps applicable to any company in any industry own a total of  shares of the company or less than  all of which were recently purchased in december  and january  we believe this demonstrates an absence of longterm knowledge and true interest in the company in the original nomination notices submitted to the company by the dissidents they sought to nominate  directors when at that time the board only had  seats demonstrating a lack of elementary knowledge about the company’s structure and current operations never reached out to senomyx prior to submitting their nominations failing to offer the company a chance to work with them constructively it is unclear why the dissidents are participating in this contested proxy contest to gain a change in control of senomyx despite only owning  shares of stock the dissidents lack relevant experience and professional networks necessary to drive value at the company while the dissident nominees claim that their public company board experience makes them well equipped to create value at senomyx they have not offered evidence that they actually have the relevant industry experience necessary to do so there is also no evidence of the dissident nominees possessing the necessary networks and relationships vital to creating future partnerships for product advancement and commercial success the dissidents have had negative impacts on other companies while serving on boards and lack independence from one another with several nominees having served on the same boards in the past examples include group member charles gillman along with barry igdaloff and robert pearse served together on the novation companies novcq board which ultimately filed for bankruptcy mark stolper and david pointer served together on the alco stores alcsq board which ultimately filed for bankruptcy lee keddie benjamin large and david pointer served together on the compumed cmpd board a company with a current market capitalization of less than  million with cash and cash equivalents of less than  for the quarter ending december    lee keddie and david pointer were nominees on a dissident slate nominated by a fellow csns member in respect of the  annual meeting of shareholders of cui global inc cui lee keddie charles gillman barry a igdaloff and benjamin e large are presently nominees on a dissident slate for election as directors at birner dental management services bdms senomyx’s current board has a strategic plan in place with positive results that demonstrate that your board is providing the necessary oversight to ensure that initiatives are being executed and that the company is well positioned for future growth and success it is critical to avoid your company being placed in the hands of a slate with shortterm interests and a lack of industry experience that is sure to put your investment at risk vote on the white proxy card for all seven of the company’s director nominees – stephen a block esq mary ann gray phd michael e herman john poyhonen kent snyder daniel e stebbins and christopher j twomey – at the upcoming annual meetingyour vote matters and can ensure that senomyx’s momentum is not arrested at the
