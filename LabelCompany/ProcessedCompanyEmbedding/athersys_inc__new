the us europe and japan according to business insights analysis these include acute trauma or ischemic injury conditions such as stroke traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury as well as episodic chronic or progressive neurological conditions like depression schizophrenia epilepsy parkinsons disease multiple sclerosis alzheimers disease migraine adhd and other conditions for many neurological conditions there are few effective therapeutic options available and the field is an intense area of research and development among major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we believe that multistem® could have broad relevance for treating acute neurological conditions and injuries such as stroke traumatic brain injury tbi neonatal hypoxic ischemia and possibly spinal cord injury as well as chronic neurological conditions that involve inflammation and neurodegeneration such as multiple sclerosis and possibly parkinsons disease in preclinical studies administration of multistem in various models of neurological injury has shown the potential to reduce inflammatory mediated damage and enhance tissue repair and healing such as promoting repair of the blood brain barrier specifically we believe that multistem may provide a benefit in certain neurological conditions in several ways such as by protecting damaged or injured neurons reducing inflammation promoting formation of new blood vessels and by augmenting tissue repair and healing we are working with multiple independent labs to evaluate the potential application of multistem in a range of neurological conditions multistem overview neurological ischemic stroke other neurological indications cardiovascular acute myocardial infarction peripheral vascular disease congestive heart failure chf

off the shelf biologic product multistem product profile cell therapy product based on patented mapc® technology developing for offtheshelf administration  no tissue matching needed large scale production potential eg millions of doses from each donor long storage life  can be kept frozen for years consistent safety profile promotes healing and tissue repair through multiple mechanisms of action not a permanent transplant  cells cleared from the body over time like a drug we are developing multistem® a proprietary stem cell product for the treatment of multiple distinct diseases and conditions in the cardiovascular neurological inflammatory and immune disease areas multistem is a biologic product that is manufactured from human stem cells obtained from adult bone marrow or other nonembryonic tissue sources unlike other cell types after isolation from a qualified donor multistem may be expanded on a large scale for future clinical use and stored in frozen form until needed cells obtained from a single donor require no genetic modification and may be used to produce banks yielding hundreds of thousands to millions of doses of multistem – an amount far greater than other stem cell types can achieve each bank is extensively characterized to ensure product consistency and safety multistem consists of a special class of human stem cells that have the ability to express a range of therapeutically relevant proteins and other factors as well as form multiple cell types factors expressed by multistem have the potential to deliver a therapeutic benefit in several ways such as reducing inflammation protecting damaged or injured tissue and enhancing the formation of new blood vessels in regions of ischemic injury these cells exhibit a druglike profile in that they act primarily through the production of multiple factors that regulate the immune system protect damaged or injured cells promote tissue repair and healing and the cells are subsequently cleared from the body over time during several years of preclinical work multistem has demonstrated the potential to address each of the fundamental limitations observed with traditional bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplants these limitations include the historical requirement for tissue matching between donor and patient the typical need for one donor for each patient a reflection of the inability to expand cells in a controlled and reproducible manner frequent use of immune suppressive drugs to avoid rejection or immune system complications and a range of other potential safety issues we believe that multistem represents a potential bestinclass stem cell therapy because it exhibits each of the following characteristics based on research and development to date  it may be produced on an industrial scale in a well validated and reproducible manner  it may be administered without tissue matching making it analogous to type o blood  it exhibits a consistent safety profile and  it appears capable of delivering therapeutic benefit through multiple mechanisms of action based upon work that we and independent collaborators have conducted over the past several years we believe that multistem has the potential to treat a range of disease indications including ischemic injury and cardiovascular disease certain neurological diseases autoimmune disease transplant support including in oncology patients and a range of orphan disease indications multiple potential mechanisms of benefit though mapcs have the potential to differentiate into a variety of cell types the primary mechanisms of action of multistem appear to be achieved through the production of a physiologically relevant and complex set of therapeutic molecules in response to the local environment in the initial indications athersys is pursuing the cells appear to minimize the inflammatory reaction that occurs in response to ischemic events such as myocardial infarction or stroke or the antihost immune reaction seen in graft vs host disease gvhd and promote healing and recovery in other ways unlike traditional pharmaceuticals multistem cells are dynamically regulated and have the potential to respond to signals of inflammation or tissue damage in multiple ways potential mechanisms of benefit include protection of damaged or injured cells reduction of inflammation stimulation of new blood vessels and the recruitment of other cell types to promote tissue repair and healing multistem overview neurological ischemic stroke other neurological indications cardiovascular acute myocardial

is poised to disrupt the ischemic stroke marketjun  about athersys inc athx jesse donovan smallcap natural resources biotech techsummarythe only existing fda approved treatment for ischemic stroke is insufficient to meet patients needs athersys has made considerable clinical progress developing a new treatment for ischemic stroke athersys will fundamentally transform the ischemic stroke market if it succeeds in bringing the new treatment to market positive phase ii results and fda fasttrack provide a significant degree of optimism to investors in athersys athersys nasdaqathx is in a strong position to fundamentally transform the ischemic stroke market in the next several years specifically athersys is poised to capture a significant portion of a large inadequately served market this potential makes athersys an appealing longterm investment athersys athersys is a biotechnology company which aims to address a plethora of unmet needs in the field of regenerative medicine athersys is developing a proprietary stem cell product called multistem which is intended to treat multiple diseases this article focuses specifically on the potential use of multistem to treat ischemic stroke this particular topic has been selected primarily due to the potential for the ischemic stroke market to be fundamentally transformed by multistem it is important to note however that athersys is engaged in multiple clinical programs the graphic below sets out an overview of athersys current clinical programs source athersys multistem multistem is created from human stem cells which originate from adult bone marrow and other tissue cells multistem allows the cells obtained from an eligible donor to be used to create hundreds of thousand or millions of doses this is a significant advantage over existing stem cell therapies furthermore multistem doses can be stored for years in a frozen form finally and most importantly multistem can be used to treat a variety of different diseases as described by athersys factors expressed by multistem have the potential to deliver a therapeutic benefit in several ways such as reducing inflammation protecting damaged or injured tissue and ehancing the formation of new blood vessels in regions of ischemic injury ischemic stroke ischemic strokes occur when blood clots block arteries or blood vessels leading to the brain according to the center for disease control and prevention almost  new strokes occur in the united states each year  of these strokes are ischemic around  million strokes occur annually in the us japan and europe the incidence of ischemic stroke will increase markedly as the global population ages in sum the market for an effective ischemic stroke treatment is large and growing existing ischemic stroke treatment there is currently only one fda approved treatment for ischemic stroke the treatment is called alteplase and generally must be administered within three hours of stroke according to the american stroke association the most common reason for not treating with alteplase is due to delays in presentation to medical attention only  of ais patients present to the emergency department within  hours of symptom onset an individual who experienced a stroke during the night alone or in a rural area would likely have significant difficulty reaching the hospital in time some ischemic stroke patients may benefit from endovascular procedures which consist of the removal of large blood clots in the brain with a stent these procedures should be completed after the patient receives alteplase and not longer than six hours after stroke onset in sum alteplase and endovascular procedures must be completed in a very short period of time after the ischemic stroke occurs disruptive nature of athersys multistem a major strength of multistem for the treatment of ischemic stroke is that multistem can be administered for a significantly longer period after the incidence of ischemic stroke than alteplase the results of athersys phase ii clinical trial for ischemic stroke demonstrated that multistem is safe and associated with increased recovery for patients who receive treatment within  hours after the occurence of ischemic stroke this is a significantly longer period than what currently is available these results provides hope for individuals who experience ischemic stroke and are unable to access immediate medical attention the phase iii trial will administer a dose of multistem or a placebo within  hours after incidence of ischemic stroke if successful multistem may become the standard treatment for ischemic stroke this significant development would add enormous value to athersys and would validate multistem as a groundbreaking product in the field of regenerative medicine athersys ischemic stroke phase  trial there have been several positive developments in relation to athersys phase iii trial first on september   athersys announced that it had reached an agreement with the fda under a special protocol agreement for the phase iii trial essentially this agreement means that the fda agrees that the design of the phase iii trial is acceptable to form the basis of a submission for approval of multistem for the treatment of ischemic stroke secondly athersys was granted fasttrack designation from the fda for its upcoming ischemic stroke clinical trial potential risks like any biotechnology company athersys faces risks in the future phase iii clinical trials could fail to achieve the effective results which were demonstrated in phase ii athersys could also face a shortage of cash if it fails to find a partner to help fund its phase iii trial conclusion the current treatment for ischemic stroke is insufficient athersys is poised to fundamentally disrupt the ischemic stroke market by bringing multistem onto the market the special protocol agreement and the fasttrack designation make athersys an attractive investment candidate for those wishing to capitalize on the transformation of the ischemic stroke market disclosure i amwe are long athx i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving
