and the midwest tuesday august   nashua vs swaps owner william woodward jr leads nashua eddie arcaro up into the winners circle at washington park fiftyfive years ago today one of the most famous match races in thoroughbred history took place at washington park in homewood which is long gone now but ranked as one of the foremost venues in racing for several decades in the middle of the th century below is an account of the race from the recent book heydays great stories in chicago sports      the great match race of august   at washington park featured the two most illustrious threeyearolds of the day nashua and swaps      the two had competed once before in the kentucky derby of that same year on that occasion swaps took command from the outset then held off nashua by a length and a half in a stirring stretch duel swaps returned to california after the derby leaving the preakness and belmont stakes to nashua who won both races impressively in july nashua came to arlington park and triumphed in the arlington classic—his eighth victory of the year in nine starts swaps meanwhile was still undefeated for the year the public and the media clamored for a rematch as soon as nashua crossed the finish line in the classic ben lindheimer executive director of arlington park and washington park turned to nashua’s owner william woodward jr who was sitting beside him and proposed the match race several days later lindheimer announced that nashua and swaps would meet at washington park on the last day of august for  winnertakeall      nashua was the best in the east swaps the best in the west they met in the middle for the great match race      swaps arrived in chicago first and prepared for the match race by running in the american derby also at washington park on august  trying the grass for the first time in his career he beat traffic judge runnerup to nashua in the classic by one length at a mile and threesixteenths nashua warmed up for the race at saratoga where trainer jim fitzsimmons kept the rest of his stable and where jockey eddie arcaro was available for morning workouts      in fitzsimmons and arcaro nashua had two of the greatest names in the history of racing on his side fitzsimmons a living legend was  years old and had been in the game as a stablehand jockey and trainer since  though severely stooped by arthritis in his spine he was invariably cheerful—hence his nickname sunny jim he had trained two triple crown winners gallant fox and omaha and countless other stakes winners he was also known for the many pearls of wisdom that he freely dispensed “what you can learn from fixing up a cheap horse will come in handy on an expensive one” “no trainer has ever made a bad horse good but some trainers have made good horses bad” “keep regular hours eat simple food get plenty of fresh air and always remember that human beings are inconsistent”      arcaro had piloted two triple crown winners whirlaway and citation he remains the only jockey to have swept the series twice his five wins in the kentucky derby five in the preakness and six in the belmont stakes were all records horseplayers called him steady eddie heady eddie or simply the master      interestingly though they were a nearly invincible team arcaro hated nashua whom he called “one mean bastard” and the feeling seemed to be mutual “he’d bite me” said arcaro “if i let him”      while nashua was a regally bred standard bearer of the eastern racing aristocracy swaps was the product of humbler origins the first californiabred to win the derby since  was owned by a roughhewn cowboy rex ellsworth and trained by another mesh tenney his jockey was a yearold texan bill shoemaker who before long would succeed arcaro as the rider everyone wanted for a big race      although it did not become widely known until later swaps had a chronic foot problem that flared up in the days just before the race ellsworth and tenney even went to lindheimer to see about postponing the event but time had been set aside for a national telecast on cbs and thousands were on their way to chicago to witness what had been billed as the race of the century race day was also the closing day of washington park’s season a postponement or cancellation would be a financial and publicrelations disaster ellsworth agreed to go ahead      a crowd of —amazing for a wednesday afternoon—turned out for the race augmented by millions tuned in on radio or television the race was carded for a mile and a quarter with each horse carrying  pounds—the same conditions as their earlier meeting in the derby heavy rains the night before had made the track soggy but there was no standing water and the racing surface was officially labeled “good”      in the derby shoemaker and swaps had gotten the jump on arcaro and nashua arcaro had bided his time in the early stages waiting for another contender named summer tan to make a move by the time nashua raced summer tan into submission swaps had gotten away to a clear lead and he was able to withstand a determined drive by nashua in the last quarter mile arcaro vowed that he and nashua would dictate the pace this time      both horses appeared to be in peak form as they paraded to the post no one in the crowd would have guessed that swaps was less than a hundred percent even tenney wasn’t sure how much less than his best he was that day swaps was favored at  nashua was  they entered the starting gate nashua in the no  stall and swaps in no  and were off      “there was nothing complicated about it” evan shipman wrote in daily racing form “as the doors opened arcaro yelling like a banshee and wielding his whip with all his strength shot nashua to the front while swaps away on the outside veered farther out toward the outside rail” arcaro pushed nashua from the bell and kept pushing him he also forced swaps away from the best footing on the inside part of the track nashua led as they passed the grandstand for the first time and it was clear that arcaro intended for him to lead all the way to the wire      time is of little importance in a match race of course because all that matters is beating the other horse but arcaro put nashua through the early stages of the race at a murderous pace playing “catch us if you can” nashua went half a mile in  seconds and six furlongs in  a full second faster than excellent sprinters had managed in sixfurlong races earlier in the day he was going to make it very difficult for swaps racing outside in the heavier going to get around him      swaps was game and several times shoemaker brought him almost abreast of his rival but nashua refused to yield each time swaps ranged up to contest the lead nashua dug in and extended his advantage even in the home stretch arcaro kept his whip busy to make sure that nashua continued driving only in the final furlong by which time the outcome had been decided did he permit nashua to coast      nashua came to the wire six and a half lengths in front      “it was a great race and naturally the thrill of my life” said fitzsimmons he went on to explain that he had instructed arcaro simply to “get out and go” then smiling sunny jim said “and eddie did” the race catapulted nashua to horse of the year honors two years later at the age of  fitzsimmons trained another horse of the year nashua’s half brother bold ruler—who went on to even greater renown as the sire of secretariat      tenney was gracious in defeat “it was a great race and a mighty tough one to lose” he said “but i’ll definitely say the better colt won this afternoon” he didn’t make any excuses declining even to mention swaps’s injury—but he did give the colt the rest of the year off when swaps came back in  and won eight of his  starts it was his turn to be horse of the year      nashua raced from may  to october  swaps from may  to september  but even though their careers overlapped almost exactly they met only twice of nashua’s  starts  were in new york or new jersey of swaps’s  starts  were in california we’ll never know what might have happened had they come together for a third contest to settle their rivalry regardless each did quite well going his own way nashua was champion twoyearold of  champion threeyearold and horse of the year in  swaps was champion older horse and horse of the year in  he closed out his career in chicago with a victory in the washington park handicap      the washington park match race was a memorable chapter but far from the only one in the careers of its principle protagonists both horses both jockeys and both trainers had many triumphs ahead and all six were destined for the national racing hall of fame but for william woodward jr nashua’s owner the match race was the last great victory less than two months later he was shot to death in a bedroom of his long island estate—by his wife who evidently mistook him for a burglar when his executors liquidated woodward’s assets his many thoroughbreds included nashua fetched a price of  it was the first time that a horse had ever been sold for more than a million dollars adapted from heydays great

harold baines luis aparicio luke appling minnie minoso nellie fox ted lyons wednesday august   cub fans bid lou adieu lou piniella baseball card       it was an aging and weary lou piniella who retired sunday after nearly four years as manager of the cubs piniellas experience with the cubs was bittersweet which is more than many of his forerunners whose experiences were only bitter can say      on the plus side piniella became the first skipper to lead the cubs to backtoback postseason appearances in  and  since the immortal frank chance did so in   and  and he tried at least to establish a general atmosphere of accountability that was often lacking for the lovable losers of seasons past      alas like his immediate predecessor dusty baker whose tenure also began with a bang piniellas stay with the cubs ended with a whimper or maybe it was a yawn given the almost incredibly dismal performance of this years club piniella was clearly sorry to be taking off his uniform for the last time but he must also have been relieved to be escaping what had become an awful mess      fortyone years ago it was a different story then piniella was coming not going after getting one atbat for baltimore in  and five for cleveland in  piniella found himself in  with the seattle pilots a firstyear expansion club that soon flew to milwaukee and became the brewers this period of piniellas career is colorfully recalled in jim boutons famous book ball four      boutons first interaction with piniella took place when he phoned the latter to enlist him in a player strike that was being planned i reached lou in florida bouton wrote and he said that his impulse was to report that he was scared it would count against him if he didnt that he was just a rookie looking to make the big leagues and didnt want anybody to get angry at him but also that hed thought it over carefully and thought he should support the other players and the strike so he was not reporting      that impressed the hell out of me heres a kid with a lot more at stake than i a kid risking a onceinalifetime shot and suddenly i felt a moral obligation to the players i decided not to go down to spring training      the work stoppage was soon averted and the players duly reported to spring training there piniella was not called sweet lou as he was in later years he was redass lou as fired up as they come pilots manager joe schultz took an instant and intense dislike to him piniella says he knows they dont want him bouton wrote and that hes going to quit baseball rather than go back to triplea      piniella was indeed sent to the minorleague camp but he didnt quit just days after being farmed out he was traded to the kansas city royals the american leagues other firstyear expansion club where he not only earned a starting job but won the rookie of the year award to boot he played five seasons for the royals and  more for the yankees before embarking on a year managerial career      piniella won two world series as a player and another as a manager he spent four decades doing something he was deeply passionate about making a very comfortable living in the process he will most likely be elected to the hall of fame some day it is certainly true of piniella as is said of so many baseball lifers that he loved and respected the game but what set piniella apart from many of the others was that he so obviously enjoyed it as well posted by tabbertc at  pm  comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels chicago cubs lou piniella monday august   thrill of a lifetime richard duchossois      richard duchossois got the thrill of his yearold life saturday when eclair de lune carried duchossois blue and yellow silks to victory in the st running of the beverly d stakes the race named in honor of mr ds late wife who passed away in       when the filly broke loose drawing away in the stretch i stopped thinking duchossois said when we won i didnt know what to think then someone hit me on the back and said we won      after eclair de lune and jockey junior alvarado crossed the finish line a length and a half in front of runnerup hot cha cha fans sitting near duchossois gathered around to congratulate him while those in adjacent sections applauded as duchossois started to make his way toward the winners circle fans throughout the grandstand joined in      by the time duchossois was met in the winners circle by alvarado and trainer ron mcanally the warm applause had become a loud and sustained ovation from the entire crowd of  alvarado had tears streaming down his face and mcanally was overcome with emotion as he tried to explain how happy he was for his longtime friend      this was for this man right here mcanally said with his arm around duchossois he deserves it so much he is a firstclass man and i know how much he wanted to win this race for his late wife      weve had others in the beverly d   and  that we thought might be good enough duchossois said but they never cut the buck eclair de lune a fouryearold germanbred filly that mcanally found in france was specifically acquired to end that losing streakand she did           duchossois was a giant in the racing game long before his fillys stirring victory in the beverly d if racing ultimately fails to survive in illinois it will be no fault of his for he has done more than anyone and more than anyone could have expected to prop up that struggling sport in  duchossois helped to create the worlds first milliondollar race the arlington million its inaugural winner john henry was trained by mcanally in  duchossois was instrumental in staging the miracle million using tents and temporary bleachers on arlingtons infield just  days after the grandstand and clubhouse were completely destroyed by fire in  duchossois opened the rebuilt arlington facility which was far more magnificent than purely economic considerations would have dictated perhaps following his heart more than his head duchossois had attended to every detail concerning the physical setting amenities and overall experience of his customers the new arlington did not exist merely to serve its function as a place to take bets and present races it was meant to represent more than that in  duchossois offered a milliondollar purse to lure the great cigar to arlington where the latter tied the alltime record since broken by winning his th consecutive race in  duchossois brought the breeders cup world thoroughbred championships to arlington none of these triumphs equaled saturdays at least to duchossois himself id rather win this race the beverly d than the kentucky derby he said as he wiped away tears of joy this one means more to me posted by tabbertc at  pm

prestigious grass races in the world a remembrance of john henry who won the first million in  and repeated in  appears below john henry a and the bart in  arlington million      john henry was on the small side and nothing much to look at as befitted the son of an obscure sire with the somewhat comical name ole bob bowers he was sold as a yearling for only  and then—to add injury to insult—was gelded in a futile attempt to curb his nasty temper he spent his early career running at cheap tracks in louisiana with little success      his record stood at three wins in  tries when he was bought by sam and dorothy rubin in may  shipped to new york john henry became a winner from the instant he walked off the van he won his first start in the rubins’ colors on may  at aqueduct paying odds of  on june  at belmont park he raced on grass for the first time and won as he pleased—by  lengths this was the turning point for john henry running on grass and at longer distances he was an entirely different horse      on september  john henry paid his first visit to arlington park and notched his first major stakes victory capturing the round table handicap by  lengths by this time bettors had taken note of his transformation from claiming alsoran to stakes winner he left the gate in the round table at odds of       john henry was on his way he had a good campaign as a fouryearold in  finishing first or second in nine of his  starts the next year john henry had eight wins three seconds and a third in  starts he received the first of his four eclipse awards as best male grass horse of the year      in  the sixyearold john henry won five of his first six starts in topquality stakes competition then he came to arlington for the inaugural running of the arlington million the first race in the world to offer a milliondollar purse the chicago area had been hard hit by rain for several days prior to the race on august  and the arlington turf course was very soft and spongy john henry had tried soft turf only once before and had been well beaten on that occasion to make matters worse he drew the outermost post position in the million field no       sent off at odds of  john henry was the heavy favorite of the crowd but in the early stages of the mileandaquarter race it was obvious that he did not find the boggy footing to his liking he was far out of contention for the first half mile “it was terrible” said jockey bill shoemaker “he wasn’t handling it at all down the backstretch and i didn’t think we’d be close i was trying to urge him a little without making him sour but he was struggling” key to content led all the way down the backstretch and into the far turn with  longshot the bart in hot pursuit john henry was eighth as they entered the far turn      turning for home key to content yielded command to the bart john henry had moved up to fifth but he was still six lengths from the front with only a quarter mile left to go “he began to pick it up on the turn and moved through the upper stretch pretty good” shoemaker recalled “although he was still a beaten horse at the eighth pole i was trying to hold him together at that point for he was working very hard and beginning to tire”      john henry furiously charging on the outside was giving shoemaker everything he had—but it didn’t seem to be enough only an eighth of a mile from the wire the bart was still holding him off by a full length john henry kept coming he edged ever closer to the bart until finally with the cheers of the crowd rising to a crescendo the two flashed across the finish line together it was impossible to tell which horse had won nbc originally identified the bart as the winner but the photofinish pictures confirmed that john henry had prevailed by a nose      “he overcame everything” trainer ron mcanally said “he had the worst post position and this soft turf wasn’t his type of racetrack but i never saw him run a better race”      the little gelding’s thrilling triumph in the first arlington million catapulted him to horse of the year honors in  he finished the year with eight victories in  outings and earned almost  million in  physical problems prevented john henry from defending his title in the million he won twice in only six starts that year he was on the sidelines again for much of  his eightyearold season the third arlington million on august  was only his second start of the year again made a heavy favorite at  by the crowd at arlington john henry was as game as ever in losing by merely a neck to tolomeo      john henry had perhaps his finest year in  at the ripe old age of nine he won six of his last seven races finishing second in the other he earned a staggering  and was again voted horse of the year along the way he won his second arlington million a crowd of  turned out on the perfect afternoon of august  to cheer him on again the bettors’ favorite at  john henry bided his time in third position under chris mccarron while remaining always within striking range at the head of the stretch mccarron angled him right to make his customary outside run to the wire and he easily ran down the pacesetting royal heroine to score by a length and three quarters      the victory put john henry over the  million mark in career earnings—at a time when no other horse in history had collected even  million reprinted from

started out as the decatur staleys in  they played three home games in decatur and five in chicago in  ae staley decided to get out of the football business he suggested that playercoaches george halas and dutch sternaman take over ownership of the team and move it to chicago he even offered them  to get started in return for a promise to retain the name “staleys” for one more year halas and sternaman eagerly took him up on it      shortly before the  season halas called on bill veeck sr president of the cubs and father of a sevenyearold son who was destined to become a legend halas wanted to make wrigley field his team’s permanent home according to halas the negotiations lasted less than two minutes veeck asked for no cash up front probably recognizing that the young entrepreneur had none anyway instead he asked for a straight  percent of the gate receipts and all concessions halas inwardly delighted but not wanting to accede too easily said the cubs could have all the concessions except the game programs veeck agreed veeck suggested that the cubs’ take should be raised to  percent whenever the gate exceeded  halas agreed the deal was sealed with a handshake and according to halas never committed to paper it remained in effect until the bears moved to soldier field half a century later      in  the chicago staleys needed a new name “i considered naming the team the chicago cubs” halas remembered “out of respect for mr william veeck sr and mr william wrigley who had been such a great help”      naming the team the cubs would not have been as strange as it might seem today in the early decades of pro football it was not at all unusual for a city’s football team to be named after its baseball team there were and still are the new york giants there

pleasant summer evening in  he carried more than his  pounds he also carried the hopes and dreams of his fellow african americans the majority of whom were still being denied the most basic civil rights it was a sign of the times that louis was described by the tribune on the morning of the bout as the “sleepyeyed son of an alabama cotton picker” who was “no more excited about tonight’s encounter than if he was going ahuntin’ or afishin’”      the unassuming yearold louis was seeking to become only the second black man to win the heavyweight title the first jack johnson had been anything but unassuming and when his controversial reign ended it was widely suggested that no other black man ever would or should be given a title shot but now after two decades a black man did have the opportunity millions prayed that the man in question louis would make the most of it      braddock for his part was a champion of questionable quality at  he had wrested the title from max baer—who the tribune’s arch ward claimed “would have been a setup for any wellconditioned plumber in an informal bustasbustcan street corner brawl” now two years later he was making just his first title defense like louis braddock weighed in at  he was a mediocre  with  knockouts and thus a decided underdog against louis who was  with  knockouts nonetheless he put on a brave face professing to be unconcerned about the awesome punching power of the man known as the brown bomber “there will be a knockout tonight” braddock said “but it will be louis not i who will be counted out”      an estimated  spectators filled comiskey park for the bout among them were jack dempsey and gene tunney who had met at soldier field ten years before in the famous “long count” title fight      louis and braddock electrified the crowd in the first round as they charged out of their corners and slugged it out in the center of the ring a wild haymaker by braddock missed and louis responded with a leftright combination that dazed the champion then out of nowhere braddock landed a right uppercut that floored louis joe was back on his feet in an instant the two fighters traded hard rights to the head at the bell      in the second round braddock was the aggressor he pounded louis’s body then scored with a right to the head followed quickly by a left to the midsection just before the bell louis delivered a pair of solid rights to the side of braddock’s face      louis gradually took over from then on the third through sixth rounds were fairly uneventful but louis had more spring in his step and began to wear the older man down with wellaimed jabs and crosses by the seventh a cut over braddock’s left eye was bleeding freely early in that round louis rocked braddock with two short lefts to the face the champion was game and he kept battling—but even his better blows failed to faze the challenger braddock was fading fast by the end of the round      in the eighth braddock presented a stationary target for louis’s volleys louis deftly stepped out of the way of a right and responded with a stinging left to the forehead braddock flailed in vain with his right and louis sent a left hook into his breadbasket then louis planted his feet and delivered a smashing right to the jaw “braddock’s knees sagged” ward wrote “he did not stagger back as he might have from a less deadly wallop he started to sink slowly but certainly” braddock toppled over onto his right side and he was out cold as the count was administered it took two minutes more for him to regain his senses      braddock had done his best but after all he was merely a good fighter who found himself confronted by a great one less than eight rounds into his first title defense his tenure as champion was over the reign of his successor would last almost  years and include  successful defenses both alltime records      the people throughout the nation who had huddled anxiously around their radios and then erupted in celebration might not have realized it fully but a corner had indeed been turned joe louis had taken the first step in what would eventually become a parade of great africanamerican

the  cubs were sellers not buyers at the trading deadline—hence the departure of lefthander ted lilly a gamer a leader and a winner and as such a poor fit for this year’s club sixtyfive years ago however it was a different story the midseason acquisition of hank borowy sparked the  cubs to the pennant their most recent to date hank borowy      on a day off in late july  cubs manager charlie grimm and general manager jim gallagher went fishing when they returned in the wee hours “full of beer” by gallagher’s own admission gallagher’s wife told him that someone from new york had been trying to reach him by phone all afternoon and evening he dialed the number given and found larry macphail general manager of the yankees on the other end of the line he was the grandfather of andy macphail who was not born yet but would one day occupy the same position with the cubs      “what will you give us for borowy” macphail demanded      gallagher could not believe his ears hank borowy  was a mainstay of the yankee staff compiling a record of  since  then as now quality starting pitchers were a precious commodity this was all the more true given the wartime talent pool      “how the hell can you ever get waivers on him” gallagher asked      “i’ve got the waivers” macphail replied “do you want him or don’t you”      by asking for waivers macphail had theoretically made borowy available to any american league club that was willing to fork over  but no doubt suspecting that macphail would withdraw borowy’s name as soon as someone filed a claim on him the other american league general managers all passed macphail was now free to deal borowy to a national league club for any mutually agreedupon price      the startled gallagher acquired borowy for  and two minorleague players who were never heard of again macphail’s apparent generosity has been wondered at ever since one theory holds that he believed borowy was about to be drafted into the service another that he assumed recurring blisters on borowy’s pitching fingers would soon end hank’s career grimm had perhaps the most interesting explanation “a few years before when larry was with the brooklyn dodgers” grimm said “he had made a slick deal with the cubs for second baseman billy herman i’ve often thought he showed his appreciation by clearing the way for us to land borowy”      the acquisition would prove to be a godsend for gallagher and the cubs borowy made  starts going  with a  earnedrun average he was  against the defending champion cardinals who finished three games behind the
