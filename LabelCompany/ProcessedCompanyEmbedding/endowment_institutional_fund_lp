investing privcap  fundraising  performance  “working the network” for pe allocations   september   interviewed by tom franco produced in partnership with mvision video clip login to view full video “working the network” for pe allocations it’s unusual for a private school with a small endowment but the choate rosemary hall school has a twoperson office to handle investments john burditt is one of them he discusses the limits to small institutions’ private equity investments why networking is key and where he sees opportunity ahead it’s unusual for a private school with a small endowment but the choate rosemary hall school has a twoperson office to handle investments john burditt is one of them he discusses the limits to small institutions’ private equity investments why networking is key and where he sees opportunity ahead “working the network” for pe allocations with john burditt of choate rosemary hall  tom franco cdr we’re here with john burditt chief investment officer of the choate rosemary do i have that right john burditt choate rosemary hall choate rosemary hall franco great let’s start at the beginning how did you get to choate and in the seat you’re in now burditt basically my career started at chase manhattan as a commercial banker i did that for seven years and moved from there into higher education in the cfo role i’ve worked for three different institutions over the years and eventually joined choate in  as the cfo fastforward until about – we began discussing a lot like at most small institutions the cfo was handling a million different things and the endowment investing along with a committee we really wanted somebody fulltime dedicated to the school’s endowment working for the school working with the committee so i agreed to build that function that we hadn’t had before and we hired a new cfo in my place since the beginning of  i’ve been the cio i started out by myself and worked several years by myself now we’re three people in the office another investor person and a support person franco so you’ve grown the platform tell us how you think about asset allocation you’re a relatively small endowment you have limited resources burditt yes franco how do you think about asset allocation how did you think about jumping into private equity investing burditt even though we’re very small we believe the principles of asset allocation apply to an institution of almost any size the question becomes whether you can have access to all the diversified asset classes being small and whether you have the capabilities of doing that so our asset allocation is similar to a very large university but we thought we had specific capabilities that would allow us to do that effectively we decided we would start with fundtofund relationships because we wanted to get to know the space first so we have very selectively chosen a couple of fundtofund relationships in the case of private equity work with common fund and they’ve been very helpful in giving us exposure to the asset class while they initially make all the decisions of course of how we’re invested but i’ve moved along the timeline as we develop more expertise and confidence working together with some of our alumni our trustees and other people we begin to feel we wanted to move and start making some direct investments we’ve made three so far over the last three to four years and we believe that—at least in domestic private equity—we will continue to focus on the domesticdirect program in terms of things like international particularly emerging markets we don’t feel we have the capability to travel and do those things to support that so we would continue using fundtofunds for that franco let’s start with the issue of access i think this is a choate issue but it might be broadly applicable to similarly situated institutions looking at making commitments to private equity burditt the access has gotten a bit easier in some of the top tier firms than it was before but even there we feel it’s a relationship we want to have with a private equity firm we think they want to have a relationship with really solid investors longterm people who are likeminded to them so we present ourselves that way to the private equity firms we’re interested in working with we often have an introduction to those firms again through our network it could be a part of our alum network part of what i call our “peerinstitution” network but we talk to a lot of other pure institutions mostly in the highereducation arena often they are willing to help us make the connections with the right people because we are very small we’re going to make an allocation that will be probably below the stated minimum the firm definitely would do franco so you work the network burditt we work the network franco tell us a bit about the process that you and your team go through to evaluate the manager what are the key factors in terms of evaluating burditt we want people who are firms of very high integrity people who have a passion for what they do and are what we call less focused on gathering assets to earn a lot of fee income and money but they have the commitment to controlling fund size and to generating high returns which is what we’re interested in of course so another aspect of that is to make sure that whenever we’re looking at a manager we look a lot at the alignment of interest between how the manager sits in the relationship and the investments and how we sit then of course we look for things like the continuity of the team the track record the investment process and ownership is it owned by one or two people and controlled by that is ownership spread to the decisionmakers and the stakeholders in the firm we’d like to see that broadly based in the firm so everyone has an incentive to stay and again have that alignment of interest with us as investors it’s very hard to do because again as a smaller investor typically we don’t get the face time you might call with the firms mainly invest with that a very large organization would get so we do the best we can and we try to have access and talk to some of the senior people in the organization obviously there are a lot of materials now that every private equity firm provides in writing and their data rooms we pore over all that information when do have that face time we try to be extremely prepared so that we don’t waste anyone’s time and we’re asking the really important questions franco what are some factors that might kill a deal for you burditt obviously a network contact coming back and telling us there are some issues—our concern to them and therefore ourselves things like fund size can matter it’s not really the size of the fund that’s important sometimes it’s more the trajectory of that so if last time a firm raised “x” and now they’re raising x it’s the change that concerns us whether they started out small or so forth fund size can matter it also has happened sometimes that we go and meet ourselves with a firm where we just can’t get comfortable with the people we’re dealing with even though our network may have gotten that comfort we need to have it ourselves because down the road we always want to be able to if it doesn’t go well not feel we took shortcuts or didn’t understand why we were committed to making the investment we did franco how do you work with the investment committee of the board any lessons learned or advice to other institutions that are trying to think through their processes burditt there are quite a few lessons learned as a small institution it’s probably unusual but one thing we have adopted is we really felt that continuity in the investment program is essential it can be very difficult for the small institutions who have trustees coming and going in various terms because our investment program is that we think of it in   or year timeframes it can be very difficult sometimes to continue with that change in leadership so we felt that one reason for establishing a dedicated investment program at the school for school employees was in order to provide that continuity we could have change at the leadership level but we would have a track record a program policies and procedures we’ve have something very stable that wouldn’t be dependent on some individual coming onto the committee and having strong opinions about something franco how was your financial crisis and how has it affected your thinking today burditt we were actually in a fortunate place again we had a diverse allocation program we had our policies and our procedures in place we had the approach that we were setting targets each year which we did adjust to those targets from time to time but not very much we rebalance those targets regularly so specifically through  and  we were rebalancing our portfolio every month which meant we were selling treasuries in our case and buying equities all through the down period we stuck to our guns and our endowment value did decline a lot like everybody else’s did but we kept at it so when the rebound happened we bounced back very nicely franco let’s turn more forwardlooking as you survey the private equity environment today what are the opportunities that strike you burditt there are probably two areas of interest to us going forward one is we feel with our most recent commitments that we built a very solid core domestic private equity base for what we’re doing so going forward in the domestic side we’d be looking probably for some more niche strategies that might be less crowded or might be smaller scale in terms of what we’ve done so far to try like everyone else to access places that might be not as competitive then generally we haven’t done a lot of international so emerging markets that sound interesting to us as well as just global international but we haven’t done much there as i mentioned before because of our limited capabilities most likely we would access international opportunities continued out through fundtofunds we don’t travel the world we have two people it’s very difficult to do even on their public equity side our major emerging market exposure is with a fundoffunds in the emerging market area because again we don’t want to travel in asia we’re not traveling to south america it’s very difficult for us to find the time to do that and to continue to do everything else we need to be doing franco people are saying this is a tricky time to be investing what concerns do you have generally and specifically with respect to the private equity industry burditt the major concern we all have is that we have spending needs for our operating budgets for our educational institutions and we’re allocating about  or  every year to support our budget in order to do that at the same time we want to be able to provide that support to the budget and we also want to retain enough return every year in the endowment to increase or to maintain its economic value so the question is how do we do that going forward with the challenges that there seem to be headwinds in almost every asset class whether it’s fixed income or equities we’re concerned that over the next five to year period we may fall short of this objective of generating a sufficient return to cover inflation and supply the spending for our operating budget unfortunately there’s no magic solution we’ve found yet franco i want to ask you about your biggest challenges and also what you enjoy most about your job on the challenges side dealing with the headwinds is part of it anything else you’d identify burditt in terms of the challenges i think no the challenge of the job is probably more psychological in many ways in other words you’re doing everything you can to put the right pieces in place and to do well going forward but in the end you don’t control it it’s a very longterm game and effort particularly in a case where you’re building private capital programs and you’re in the process of doing that i would say it’s probably going to take you a year time frame at least before you know whether the whole program is functioning well franco talk about what advice you might give other institutions perhaps the same size as choate burditt we’re quite unusual we have a million endowment and we’re unusual in that we have a dedicated investment office at our size very few other institutions do in our peer group the only one that has a dedicated investment office is an institution that has an endowment more than double our size nobody else our size has a dedicated office so my advice would be to think that through again because from a fiduciary standpoint it’s been a tremendous benefit to our board to know that they have some people working from them who are monitoring the managers the other aspect of it is that again in the endowment foundation world it’s a very collaborative community so you can develop very effective networks if you have people with the time to do that that will strengthen the investment program at all these institutions the cost isn’t that great the total cost for the choate program is about just over  basis points and if some of the schools would outsource this function to other people are paying  basis points to  basis points so it may appear expensive when you’re a small institution and you have a small faculty register
