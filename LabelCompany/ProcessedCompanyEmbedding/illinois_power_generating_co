research   oct  london  october   global unregulated utilities and power companies as the largest source of carbon emissions in most developed countries will need to contribute a large share of the emission reductions agreed under the paris agreement  says moodys investors service in a new report published today however generators with the right business mix may find opportunities while supportive policies in some markets may ease the transition for those negatively affected moodys report titled global unregulated utilities and power companies carbon transition brings risks and opportunities is available on wwwmoodyscom moodys subscribers can access this report here we expect to see a continued rise in renewable energy more distributed generation and overall lower growth in the demand for energy as a result of efficiency improvements disruptive technologies including energy storage could also challenge the economics of power generation businesses says graham taylor a moodys vice president  senior analyst and one of the reports authors these trends have already had a material impact on the credit quality of some utilities particularly in europe and will pose an increasing challenge for those with material exposure to highercost generation adds mr taylor however utilities with flexible generation competitive advantage in developing renewables or innovative service offerings may be better positioned to weather changes in the sector moodys will consider utilities ability to adapt to changing policies and market conditions in its assessment of their credit quality as a starting point its assessment will use a central scenario consistent with the nationally determined contributions ndcs agreed at the united nations paris conference in addition moodys analysis will also qualitatively consider a wider range of potential outcomes depending upon either a more or less rapid carbon transition in its central scenario moodys expects a drop in revenues for power generators currently earning significant profits from selling electricity at market prices as the growth of lowcost or subsidised renewable generation weighs on wholesale prices plants that are more carbonintensive compared to their local market may also be unable to recover the higher costs imposed by carbon taxes and similar measures however even as generators with high variable costs are able to run profitably for increasingly short periods efficient and flexible plants may benefit by balancing renewables we will also incorporate regional variations in the profitability of various fuels for example in the us low prices will drive strong demand for natural gas over the next decade despite it being a fossil fuel gas is seen as a less carbonintensive bridge to a cleaner energy future said swami venkataraman senior vicepresident and one of the reports authors moodys recognises that disruptive technologies are likely to transform the electric system over time broader deployment of renewables as well as smart meters and appliances distributed generation energy storage and smart grids will challenge companies focused on centralised energy generation utilities with regulated transmission and distribution networks and other sources of highlypredictable earnings may be more resilient although these may also become more risky over time as distributed generation shifts the burden of network costs this report is part of a series assessing the credit implications of the paris agreement for those sectors moodys identifies as most impacted by its implications

lgd outlook actions issuer illinois power generating company outlook remains negative affirmations issuer illinois power generating company  speculative grade liquidity rating affirmed sgl ratings rationale the downgrade is prompted by genco parent company dynegy incs dynegy b cfr stable announcement that it had reached a tentative agreement with some genco bondholders to restructure gencos debt the proposed exchange offer would result in genco lenders receiving about  cents on the dollar which we view as a distressed exchange said swami venkataraman senior vice president if the exchange is successful the substantially lower debt burden would allow the  gw generating portfolio at genco and affiliate illinois power resources generating unrated to be cash flow positive he added as per a form k filed by dynegy on october   dynegy reached an agreement with genco and an ad hoc group of genco bondholders to restructure gencos  million of unsecured debt under the proposed restructuring lenders would receive  million in new year dynegy unsecured notes  million in cash and  million dynegy warrants with a year tenor and strike price of  per share given that dynegy stock currently trades at approximately share and considering the distressed state of the merchant power industry we do not believe the warrants are likely to be worth much which implies lenders will receive approximately  cents on the dollar if the restructuring is executed dynegy and genco have launched a simultaneous solicitation of genco noteholders should the offer obtain the consent of over  of these lenders there will simply be an out of court restructuring if more than  but less than  agree genco will likely go through a prepackaged chapter  bankruptcy filing rating outlook gencos outlook is negative reflecting the likelihood of a lower rating if the expected distressed exchange occurs what could change the rating  up gencos rating is unlikely to be upgraded over the nearterm given the pending distressed exchange what could change the rating  down gencos rating is likely to be downgraded further if and when the exchange offer occurs should the exchange offer fail to obtain twothirds approval we think an eventual bankruptcy filing is likely at or prior to the  debt maturity which would also result in a lower rating the principal methodology used in these ratings was unregulated

with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this report overview we own and operate a merchant generation business in illinois we have an  percent ownership interest in and consolidate for financial reporting purposes eei eei operates merchant electric generation facilities in illinois and fercregulated transmission facilities in illinois and kentucky on december   we were acquired by iph an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of dynegy in connection with the aer acquisition ameren retained certain historical obligations of aer and its subsidiaries including certain historical environmental and tax liabilities we did not apply pushdown accounting as a result of the aer acquisition which would require the adjustment of assets and liabilities to fair value recognized by dynegy to be shown in our consolidated financial statements our approximately  million in aggregate principal amount of longterm notes remain outstanding as an obligation of genco we are organized into a ringfenced group in order to maintain corporate separateness from dynegy and its other legal entities which include iprg and ipm further iph and its direct and indirect subsidiaries present themselves to the public as separate entities genco has a psa with ipm whereby ipm purchases all of the capacity and energy available from gencos generation fleet ipm entered into a similar psa with iprg a related party under the psas revenues allocated between genco and iprg are based on reimbursable expenses and generation of each entity the reimbursable expenses used in the calculation of revenues allocated under the genco and iprg psas include operation costs in addition to depreciation and interest on debt eei also has a psa with ipm whereby ipm purchases all of the capacity and energy available from eeis generation fleet with limited exceptions the price that ipm pays for capacity is the miso local resource zone  clearing price ipm pays spot market prices for the associated energy in addition eei will at times purchase energy from ipm to fulfill obligations to a nonaffiliated party business discussion the following is a list of key factors that have affected and are expected to continue to affect our earnings and cash flows prices for power coal and natural gas which in turn are largely driven by supply and demand demand for power can vary due to weather and general economic conditions among other things power supplies similarly vary by region and are impacted significantly by available generating capacity transmission capacity and federal and state regulation the relationship between electricity prices and prices for coal and natural gas commonly referred to as the dark spread and spark spread respectively which impacts the margin we earn on the electricity we generate our ability to control capital expenditures which primarily include maintenance safety environmental and reliability projects and to control operating expenses through disciplined management our ability to optimize our assets by maintaining a high inmarket availability reliable runtime and safe lowcost operations our ability to optimize our assets through targeted investment in cost effective technology enhancements or efficiency and reliability improvements our ability to operate and deliver energy from our facilities during periods of plannedunplanned electric transmission outages our ability to post the collateral necessary to execute our commercial strategy the cost of compliance with existing and future environmental requirements that are likely to be more stringent and more comprehensive please read item  businessenvironmental matters for further discussion our ability to maintain sufficient coal inventories which is dependent upon the continued performance of the mines and railroads for deliveries of coal in a consistent and timely manner and its impact on our ability to serve the critical winter and summer onpeak loads market supply conditions resulting from federal and regional renewable power mandates and initiatives costs of transportation related to coal deliveries changes in miso and pjm market design or associated rules including the resulting effect on future capacity revenues from changes in the existing bilateral miso capacity markets the potential for more competition in generation supply and distribution including new technologies and table of contents the availability of qualified labor and material and rising costs please read item a risk factors for additional factors that could affect our future operating results financial condition and cash flows liquidity and capital resources overview in this section we describe our liquidity and capital requirements including our sources and uses of liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our debt maturities and debt service requirements contractual obligations capital expenditures including required environmental expenditures and working capital needs examples of working capital needs include purchases and sales of commodities and associated margin and collateral requirements
