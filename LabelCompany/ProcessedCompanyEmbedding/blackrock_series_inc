 its financial implicationsthe asset management business in the us has been going through tough times as the majority of the investments are directed toward lowfee passive offerings like etfs rather than highfee active strategies blackrock’s actively managed funds have been witnessing outflows over the past several quarters while its etf business recorded inflows hence in order to encourage investors to move again towards actively managed funds the company is taking these effortswiseman said “clients have moved beyond just active and passive techniques they are choosing from a variety of products that incorporate multiple investment strategies return targets levels of risk and cost expectations we are evolving our product offerings to ensure we stay ahead of those changing client desires”overall the new restructuring program will impact nearly  billion or  of its assets under management notably the company will not be making any changes to its active equity products managed

your back pocket you are sitting on your wallet the cop does not want you to get out of the car so you stay inside the cop asks for your driver license and you have to roll a bit and reach around to pull your wallet out the cop at that point is not pointing a gun at you so if someone wanted to pull a weapon out from behind themself while appearing to pull out their wallet they could get the drop on the cop so the cop can shoot first and always say they thought you were reaching for a weapon bottom line is the cop who claims i felt threatened always gets off and the citizen winds up dead
