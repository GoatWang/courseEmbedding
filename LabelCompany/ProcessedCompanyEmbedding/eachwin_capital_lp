access “in a competitive economy above all the quality and performance of the managers determine the success of a business” – drucker  “managers are the force within the firm that create perceive and pursue opportunities and therefore the force that drives differences in organizational performance” – wasserman nohria  anand  “the old adage people are your most important asset turns out to be wrong people are not your most important asset the right people are” – collins  “in order to successfully implement a strategy not only do the right leaders need to be chosen but those leaders need to be aligned across the different hierarchical levels of an organization” – fernandezaraoz  “managers differ with respect to their ability to manage resources and these differences help explain why some firms create more value from their resources than others do… resources may provide a performance advantage realizing this advantage depends on the way in which managers bundle deploy and synchronize
