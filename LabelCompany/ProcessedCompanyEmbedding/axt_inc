calling  axt is traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol axti safe harbor statement this press release contains forwardlooking statements regarding the availability performance and market acceptance of new led products the company s ability to bring these products to market and the current market conditions in the optoelectronic device industry forwardlooking statements address matters that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including but not limited to unpredictable fluctuations in our operating results due among other factors to our expansion of our china operations the limited availability and increased cost of raw materials and timing of orders from customers shortage of critical raw materials particularly gallium and arsenic where we depend on a limited number of suppliers an inability to expand our manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our products failure to achieve anticipated sales of our new hb led and vcsel products our substrate and optoelectronic device products have a long sales cycle that makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results we may experience low product yields that might result in delayed shipment of our products if we do not comply with environmental regulations we may incur large fines loss of key substrate customers would hurt our operating results if our expansion in china is costlier than expected our operating results will suffer and we continue to be dependent on revenue from international sales reference is made to axt s filings with the securities and exchange

inc a cash hoard share buybacks and other potential catalysts make this  tech stock attractivejan  about axt inc axti hawkinvest value growth at reasonable price contrarian growtheditors note this article covers a stock with less than a  million market cap please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks axt inc nasdaqaxti is a small tech company that appears to have been through some real highs and lows in the early s this stock was trading for over  the financial crisis took the stock down to about a buck in may  but it then surged to nearly  in january  as most investors know its not uncommon for tech stocks to go through these boom and bust cycles its also well known that it can really pay off big to buy at the lows if the company has the potential for another up cycle this company primarily designs and manufactures semiconductor substrates which are often used in wireless communication products fiber optics and led applications axt inc has annual revenues of about  million and the stock appears to be undervalued at current levels due to a large amount of cash plus there is always the potential for the company to reinvent its business model while it is hard to say if this stock is poised for a significant move higher any time soon there are some factors that make this stock worth considering or at least watching as the chart shows this stock has been in an uptrend in recent months it bottomed out at about  per share in october and then went up to about  in early  the recent market pullback seems to have put pressure on this stock however this could be an ideal buying opportunity as the light blue line on the chart shows this stock remains in an uptrend and it is now resting at the low end of the recent trading range in the past few months investors who have bought the stock when it traded near the blue uptrend line were rewarded and it has also paid to sell when it touched the high end of the recent trading range which is now around  per share as indicated by the purple trend line its never a sure thing but these patterns are certainly worth considering for a company with a market capitalization of about  million this one has a cash hoard it has just over  million in cash which is equivalent to around  per share and no debt on the balance sheet this is a considerable amount of cash for a stock trading at just over  per share it also appears undervalued based on book value which is around  per share when you factor in the cash and that it has no debt it shows that the enterprise value is right around  million this is another sign the company is undervalued especially when considering the annual revenues of nearly  million the cash hoard reduces downside risks for investors and gives the company flexibility to develop new products and invest in marketing one potential downside risk that needs to be considered is the fact that this company has recently posted losses for the third quarter of  it lost  million or about  cents per share the loss was partially due to a decline in gross margins from  in the second quarter to  in the third quarter this gross margin decline was due to a change in the product mix sold in that quarter however the potential downside risks from a small quarterly loss seem minimal for a stock trading at these levels especially since the company has plenty of cash clearly the company needs to increase sales or increase profit margins in order to return to a level of solid profitability another option would be to invest in new product lines and adapt to new market demands in order to create shareholder value in addition to its main line of business this company owns stakes in five joint ventures it is the majority owner in three of these ventures which gives it board level control in one company nanjing jin mei gallium co ltd which produces n n ga and b gallium it owns an  stake the stakes in these businesses may have more value than the current stock price indicates the  stake in the company that produces gallium seems most interesting since gallium can be used like liquid chocolate in d printers while this has not hit the mainstream yet it could be a potential future business opportunity d printing could revolutionize manufacturing and allow individuals to have a mini factory in their homes while most d printers use thermoplastics other materials like gallium allow printers to make metal products an article from extremetechcom explains the potential for gallium in d printing which states gallium is the chocolate of metals with a melting point of  degrees the stuff will literally melt in your hand and then solidify when you put it down this melting point can be lowered by alloying with indium to make a nontoxic substitute for mercury in applications like thermometers and tilt switches gallium has another trick up its sleeve in which it rapidly forms an oxide skin when exposed to air this property has recently been exploited by researchers at nc state to do something pretty incredibleprint stable d structures using room temperature liquid metal its far too early to know if gallium usage will grow and if this company will capitalize on d printing in the future but it sure seems to be an interesting point to consider as it could be a game changer as a high tech company axt inc could be positioned to benefit from this potential in the future if the market for gallium in d printing grows that is a big if but the fast growth in the emerging d printing industry is bound to create many opportunities that the market is not fully aware of now that potential makes this stock worth watching the cheap valuation a cash hoard and the recent pullback make it a stock to consider buying as a turnaround play management also seems to think the shares are trading at bargain levels and worth buying since it authorized a  million stock buy back just last year here are some key points for axt inccurrent share price the  week range is  to

semiinsulating and semiconducting end markets power amplifiers and radio frequency integrated circuits for wireless handsets cell phones direct broadcast television highperformance transistors satellite communications high brightness lightemitting diodes optical couplers satellite and terrestrial solar cells lasers and optical couplers manufacturing axti manufactures all semiconductor substrates using its proprietary vertical gradient freeze vgf technology most of its revenue is from sales of gaas substrates it manufactures all of its products in china which generally has favorable costs for facilities and labor compared with comparable facilities in the united states europe or japan it also has five joint ventures in china that provide pricing advantages reliable supply and shorter leadtimes for raw materials central to final manufactured products customers its  largest customers for  were avago technologies trading ltd nasdaqavgo azur space solar power gmbh beijing china crystal technology ltd hitachi cable ltd the iqe group nan da guang dang osram opto semiconductors gmbh sumika electronic materials inc sumitomo chemical co ltd otcsommf and visual photonics epitaxy co competition primary competition in the market for compound semiconductor substrates includes beijing compound crystal technology ltd freiberger compound materials mitsubishi chemical corporation and sumitomo electric industries axti believes at least two of its competitors are shipping high volumes of gaas substrates manufactured using a technique similar to its vgf technique in addition it also faces competition from compound semiconductor device manufacturers that produce substrates for their own internal use including hitachi hit and from companies such as ibm that are actively developing alternative compound semiconductor materials axti is the only compound semiconductor substrate supplier to offer a full suite of raw materials investment thesis axtis business model is attractive for a number of reasons including  high barriers to entry in its industry with a supply chain that is nearly impossible to replicate it has joint venture ownership interests in numerous chinese companies that control extremely rare and critical materials called gallium germanium and indium these materials are so limited in production that they were labelled as critical materials by the eu these jvs were set up over the course of the past  years and represent significant hidden value to shareholders the jvs ensure critical raw materials in the supply chain and partially insulate the company against the cost pressures facing its competition the company spent the better part of the decade optimizing its supply chain and seeking high client qualification requirements to win business and slowly take market share given chinas increasingly tight grip on rare earth elements and critical materials in the past few years it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to reproduce what axti has accomplished click all to enlarge few competitors and increasing market share there are very few competitors in the markets axti sells to and none control the supply chain like it does a few main competitors are located in japan and as of this writeup there are reports that hitachi cable has had some severe issues and may be offline for several weeks or even a couple of months competitor sumitomo appears to be nearly unaffected as its crystal growth is well south of tokyo nevertheless given the precarious position of having a high concentration of supply in japan customers may increasingly turn to axti for a more securestable source of product supply given capacity expansions in recent years and further planned expansion axti may be best positioned to respond to customer demands  operating leverage theres tremendous operating leverage in the business due to its low cost operations in china while sales have grown at a yr cagr of  sga

process improvement and manufacturing efficiency research gross margin improvement has increased from the mid range in  to a record  in q this margin improvement is despite increasing galliumgermaniumindium raw material costs management has guided steady state gross margins in the  range so anything above  represents material upside minimal capex requirements to expand capacity to meet growing customer demand total manufacturing space in china is  square feet  square feet of which is currently being used the company is currently preparing the remaining  square feet for increased wafer processing it also expects to begin construction of a new  sq ft facility in beijing competitors typically purchase crystal growing furnaces from original equipment manufacturers in contrast axti designs and builds its own vgf crystal growing furnaces which it believes should allow it to increase production capacity more quickly and costeffectively total capex is estimated to be m in  and should easily be covered by cash from operations recent developments axtis share price had steadily been rising throughout  as it recovered from the industry downturn and proved capable of consistently delivering earnings ahead of its guidance the company attracted two research brokers including needham and northland who each placed  targets and backed the companys outlook for strong secular growth in the recent quarter the company met its quarterly estimates but offered softer q guidance than the overly bullish analysts had hoped for by only  cents due to a seasonally weak q led market even though the companys q guidance range of  centsshare represents  growth over q results of  centsshare analysts aggressively cut estimates for  almost to the point of expecting no eps growth and the stock has fallen over  from its highs earlier this year part of the precipitous stock decline can be explained by the fact that axtis two largest shareholders are quant fund managers and as short sellers piled in the selling pressure was exacerbated as a result axtis stock price is excessively discounted by any extreme valuation measure to put the current price in perspective axtis share price has fallen to a level it traded at in  yet in  revenueseps were mc vs today at mc clearly the price drop is excessive in relation to the tremendous growth and operational improvement axti has experienced and will see going forward the trading value comparables indicate axti has one of the best ebitda margins and growth prospects yet trades at a meaningful discount to peers such as triquint tqnt oclaro nasdaqoclr avago rubicon technology nasdaqrbcn kopin nasdaqkopn emcore nasdaqemkr anadigics nasdaqanad and iqethe balance sheet is strong with plenty of cash and no debt i calculate the working capital per share is  vs a  stock price looked at another way almost  of the stock price is in working capital alternatively with  in cash  of the stock price is backed by cash these figures offer exceptional margin of safety at todays price on a cashadjusted basis axtis sub x pe valuation looks even more compelling as does a forward ebitda multiple below x catalysts axti is now in the penalty box with analysts and quant funds after the past quarter its now a showme story and will have to prove out that q is just a seasonal hiccup and not indicative of broken growth prospects catalysts will be new client wins analyst upgrades led pickup indicatons of increasing market share due to japan disruption advancement of cpv solar technology margin preservation and expansion in the face of rising input costs risks wireless mobile led and terrestrial cpv solar markets are not in secular growth period led softness in q is more than seasonal correction and will be prolonged axtis jv ownership does not represent a strategic competitive advantage in its industry and are not hidden value jvs in raw material suppliers will not allow axti to control input cost inflation and gross margins reduce materially below the  indicated by management transition to lower cost compound semi substrate technology delays in capacity expansion leading to inability to deliver for clients
