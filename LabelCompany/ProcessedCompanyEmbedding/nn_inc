engineered products group announces electron beam welding capabilities for advanced manufacturing of medical devices    nn inc nnbr        request a quote » inquiryrfqpart pricing form we will respond to your inquiry within one business day × august   nn inc precision engineered products group announces electron beam welding capabilities for advanced manufacturing of medical devices highprecision deep weld process creates ultrastrong welds in vacuum chamber environment aurora il— august  — nn inc precision engineered products group pep a global manufacturer of highly engineered precision solutions serving the medical market announces the addition of deep weld process technology to provide customers more options for complex precision assemblies this electron beam welding capability will be used wherever high strength bonding of metal components is required such as orthopedics and aerospace applications  all welds are created in a vacuum chamber for ultralow contamination and electron beams can be aimed with exceptional accuracy to weld even the smallest medical device components — with extremely high precision and strength that can be comparable to that of a monolithic unit electron beam welding – which originated from applications in the aerospace industry – penetrates deep into a metal unlike typical surface welding eg gas tungsten arc welding gtaw also known as tungsten inert gas tig welding or laser beam welding lbw  it is a unique process whereby metal components are bonded via high velocity electrons which travel throughout the mating area deep into the parts  the beam can be aimed into a blind hole or below the surface of mating components  this is particularly beneficial for orthopedic devices as electron beam welding offers high depthtowidth ratios  welds can go deep and only affect a narrow sliver of the surface protecting surrounding materials from heat exposure this means for example that a plastic handle can be assembled or over molded prior to welding reducing assembly time and potentially lowering the overall cost of the device the benefits of electron beam welding include low heat affected zone limiting impact on surrounding materials such as plastics high strength low contamination superior depth of penetration high widthtodepth ratio can be used in complex assemblies to secure multiple components with a subsurface weld “we are pleased to be one of very few companies that can offer inhouse electron beam welding capabilities along with a full range of medical device manufacturing services to our customers” said aaron bailey director of sales medical nn inc pep “electron beam welding drastically expands where welds can be created and the strength and quality of those welds its precise high strength nature is wellsuited for durable biocompatible metal instruments that are used in challenging intraoperative environments” nn inc pep has made significant investments into precision engineering equipment putting the company at the forefront of electron beam welding and other advanced manufacturing technologies the company can perform fully cnc or manual electron beam
