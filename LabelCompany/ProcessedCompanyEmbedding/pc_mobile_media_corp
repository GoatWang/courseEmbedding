have experience serving as the ceo of a public company reviewing financial statements or serving as the cfo of a public company or being responsible for the preparation of the various exchange act reports required to be filed by public companies  we have budgeted the cost to prepare and file the various exchange act reports in our use of proceeds section  the costs of the reports are included in the accounting and legal and professional line items in the use of proceeds  please see section titled managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations

and longterm marketing efforts including planned internet marketing pricing potential clients pc mobile media corp is attempting to become operational and we do not have any business operations we estimate to start generating revenue approximately three months after the closing of the public offering  investors should note that generating revenue approximately three months after the closing of the offering may be an ambitious goal and the company may not be in a position to generate revenue for a much longer period of time and we may need additional funding in order to sustain our business  in order to generate revenues pc mobile media corp must address the following areas  successfully execute our marketing and promotions plan      secure client base  develop and offer market desirable products       offer competitively priced services  continuously review our corporate structure and marketing efforts in an effort to nurture sustained growth of the company       adapt our corporate principles for expanding into complementing services and new markets   the company believes that the net offering proceeds after offering expenses of  is sufficient for the company to become operational and sustain operations through the next twelve  months the money we hope to raise through this stock offering has been budgeted to market our services pay for the lease on the mobile

the accounting and legal and professional line items in the use of proceeds section  please see section titled managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations subsection proposed milestones to implement business operations for a quarterly detailed description of the reporting requirements we estimate  is sufficient to keep the company in compliance with regulatory agencies and meet its obligations to prudently further the business of the company for the  date period the raise may take  while management estimates  for such costs there is no maximum amount of funds that mr conforte has agreed to provide  mr conforte because he is the sole officer and director and although he has orally agreed to fund such amounts as the sole officer

exceptionally high degree of risk and is extremely speculative in nature following are what we believe are material risks involved if you decide to purchase shares in this offering risks associated with our company paul conforte the sole officer and director of the company currently devotes approximately  hours per week to company matters   our business plan does not provide for the hiring of any additional employees and may never generate enough revenue to support the hiring of additional employees  therefore the responsibility of developing and furthering the companys business offering and selling of the shares through this prospectus and fulfilling the reporting requirements of a public company all fall upon paul conforte  once the public offering is closed mr conforte plans to spend the necessary time to finalize business development direct the marketing efforts to secure clients and oversee the primary operations of the business  mr conforte our sole officer has no experience in our intended line of business  while mr conforte does not intend to quit his current sales job upon the closing of the offering he does intend to limit the hours at his job so he can dedicate the necessary time to the operation of this business  it is anticipated that as the business grows mr conforte will eventually fully quit his current sales job   mr conforte does not have any public company experience and is involved in other business activities   the companys needs could exceed the amount of time or level of experience mr conforte may have  this could result in his inability to properly manage company affairs resulting in our remaining a startup company with no revenues or profits  mr conforte does not have experience serving as the ceo of a public company reviewing financial statements or serving as the cfo of a public company or being responsible for the preparation of the various exchange act reports required to be filed by public companies  we have budgeted the cost to prepare and file the various exchange act reports in our use of proceeds section  these activities will be done by independent third party contractors our sole officer and director of the company occupies all the positions a risk exists that the company may not have adequate internal controls because one person occupies all of the corporate positions  a risk also exists that there may not be funds available for net income because the sole director and officer will determine their salary and perquisites     mr conforte is involved in other business activities which may potentially result in a conflict of interest we have not formulated a plan to resolve any possible conflict of interest with his other business activities mr confortes other business activities are limited to being employed as a real estate agent working for xpand realty  his responsibilities include listing and selling of homes coordinating appointments to show properties to prospective buyers confer with title companies lenders and home inspectors to ensure that the terms and conditions of purchase agreements are met before closing  in the event he is unable to fulfill any aspect of his duties to the company we may experience a shortfall or complete lack of revenue resulting in little or no profits and eventual closure of the business   the company has generated no revenues and does not have an operating hertory an investment in the shares offered herein is highly risky and could result in a complete loss of your investment if we are unsuccessful in our business plan the company was incorporated on august   we have not yet commenced our fullscale business operations and we have not yet realized any revenues we have minimal operating history upon which an evaluation of our future prospects can be made based upon current plans we expect to incur operating losses in future periods as we incurred significant expenses associated with the initial startup of our business further we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in realizing revenues or in achieving or sustaining positive cash flow at any time in the future any such failure could result in the possible closure of our business or force us to seek additional capital through loans or additional sales of our equity securities to continue business operations which would dilute the value of any shares you purchase in this offering we are a shell company and therefore investors should be aware of the highly illiquid nature of their investment the company is a shell company as defined by as defined in

will be subject to the penny stock rules a purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock  the shares offered by this prospectus constitute penny stock under the securities and exchange act  the shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future  the classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a brokerdealer to sell the stock into a

financial statements accompanying this prospectus pc mobile media corp has had no revenues to date and has incurred only losses since its inception  the company has had no operations and has been issued a going concern opinion from our independent auditors based upon the companys reliance upon the sale of our common stock as the sole source of funds for our future operations  we do not yet have any substantial assets and are totally dependent upon the proceeds of this offering to fully fund our business  if we do not sell all the shares in this offering as it is an allornone offering then we will have to seek alternative financing to complete our business plans or abandon them pc mobile media corp has limited capital resources to date the company has funded its operations from limited funding and has not generated any cash from operations to be profitable  unless pc mobile media corp begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern pc mobile media corp may experience liquidity and solvency problems  such liquidity and solvency problems may force pc mobile media corp to cease operations if additional financing is not available no known alternative resources of funds are available to pc mobile media corp in the event it does not successfully place all of the shares in this allornone offering  however pc mobile media corp believes that if it is successful to place the allor none offering the net proceeds of the offering should be sufficient to satisfy the launch and operating requirements for the next twelve months we cannot predict when or if we will produce revenues which could result in a total loss of your investment if we are unsuccessful in our business plans we have not generated any revenue to date from operations in order for us to continue with our plans and operating our business we must raise our initial capital through this offering the timing of the completion of the milestones needed to commence

markets acceptance of our planned services if the outofdoors advertising market does not find our services desirable and we cannot attract clients we may not be able to generate any revenues which could result in a failure of our business and a loss of any investment you make in our shares the ability to offer services that the market accepts and is willing to purchase is critically important to our success we cannot be certain that the services we offer will be accepted by the marketplace  as a result there may not be any demand our revenue stream could be limited and we may never realize any revenues in addition there are no assurances that the company will generate revenues in the future even if we offer alternative services or alter our services and marketing efforts and pursue alternative or complementing revenue generating services   the loss of the services of paul conforte could severely impact our business operations and future development of our business model which could result in a loss of revenues and your inability to ever sell any shares you purchase in ther offering our performance is substantially dependent upon the professional expertise of our president paul conforte if he were unable to perform his services this loss of his capabilities could have an adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and operating results if we are unable to replace him with another qualified individual  the loss of her services could result in a loss of revenues which could result in a reduction of the value of any shares you purchase in this offering the outofdoors advertising marketplace is highly competitive  if we cannot develop and promote services that the market and individuals are willing to accept we will not be able to compete successfully and our business may be adversely affected and we may never be able to generate any revenues pc mobile media corp has many potential competitors in the outofdoors advertising marketplace  we acknowledge that our competition is competent experienced and they have greater financial and marketing resources than we do at the present our ability to compete may be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to the development promotion and marketing of their services than are available to us  some of pc mobile medias competitors may also offer a wider range of services and have greater name recognition  they have greater customer loyalty bases and these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  in addition our competitors may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities and adopt more aggressive advertising campaigns than pc mobile media corp at the present   risks associated with

offering will have limited control over matters requiring approval by pc mobile media corp security holders including the election of directors mr conforte would retain  ownership in pc mobile media corp common stock assuming the offering is attained  such concentrated control may also make it difficult for pc mobile media corp stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of pc mobile media corp common stock in the event pc mobile media corp enters into transactions which require stockholder approval in addition certain provisions of nevada law could have the effect of making it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of pc mobile media corp for example nevada law provides that not less than twothirds vote of the stockholders is required to remove a director for cause which could make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of the board of directors their concentration of ownership limits the power to exercise control by the minority shareholders we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance  without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all our business plan allows for the estimated  cost of this registration statement to be paid from proceeds raised in addition

consider that our advertising medium is unique in the fact that we can deliver an impression by taking the message where it is most likely going to be view by the intended target market  networking with other advertising agencies can provide a revenue stream that mutually benefits both parties  typically an advertising agency provides service for the client that involves exposure of their products and or services through multiple mediums  they budget the advertising dollars by allocating it to diverse advertising mediums to try to ensure exposure for the clients products or services  for example when a convention comes to town a client may only be interested in marketing their products and services for that particular timeframe because their targeted customer is in town  we provide a medium to seek out the customer by locating the advertisement at the airport when they arrive then positioning the advertisement at the convention hall and finally moving the truck to

banner graphics and proofing is available online marketing of the site will consist of linking our site to complementary sites and search engines  we plan to place a banner on complementary and related topic sites  placing our site with search engines is another valuable tool that is relatively inexpensive and has the potential to generate revenue with little maintenance      industry analysis   outofhome advertising media arbitron is an internationally recognized media and marketing research firm that describes the outdoor media as a growing medium for the following reasons        · the reach of outdoor media is significant because it reaches consumers that do not have significant exposure to newspapers or local television   · the outofhome media has an impressive reach because it has the ability to make an impression on a core group of consumers repeatedly · consumers are more likely to recall the advertiser and purchase the advertisers productsservices when exposed

outdoor medium in an effort to reach targeted consumers  our outofhome mobile medium is the solution by delivering an impression to your targeted audience repeatedly and at the right time   medium effectiveness the advertising industry agrees that outofhome advertising is one of the lowest cost per thousand advertising  cost per thousand or as its most commonly referred to as cpm has a far lower cpm that all other more tradition forms of advertising including print and radio  this equates to greater viewers for less money  in addition to its cost effectiveness outofhome advertising received a high retention score  many other advertising mediums are stationary and repetitive thus our subconscious tends to filter the impression if one is registered at all its not as indelible  our mobile medium is in different places at different times and its size alone commands attention  other notable reasons for its effectiveness include · repetition your advertisement is seen repeatedly by your customers  image recognition begins and customers remember your message image recognition equates to customers may not need your products or services today but when they do they

growth strategy will secure market share for longterm success    competitor analysis pc mobile media corp has many potential competitors in the outofhome media industry  we consider the competition is competent experienced and they have greater financial and technical and marketing resources than we do at the present  our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to the development sales and marketing of their products and services than are available to us   some of the companys competitors also offer a wider range of services and products and have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases than our company  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities technologies and customer requirements than the company  they may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities offer terms that are more attractive to customers and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the company  moreover current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their

through september   the company had no operations as of september   the company had not emerged from the development stage in view of these matters the companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the companys ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability the company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are

and cash flows of the company these financial statements are presented in united states dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states use of estimates and assumptions preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures  accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows the company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalent  at september   the company had  in cash cash flow reporting the company follows asc  statement of cash flows for cash flows reporting classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating investing or financing activities and provides definitions of each category and uses the indirect or reconciliation method indirect method as defined by asc  statement of cash flows to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of a all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and b all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments the company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period f financial instruments the companys balance sheet includes certain financial instruments including cash accounts payable accrued expenses and related party payable the carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization asc  fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between  market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and  an entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities level  inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability eg interest rates and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means level  inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of september   the respective carrying value of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments advertising advertising costs are expensed as incurred  as of september   no advertising costs have been incurred revenue and cost recognition the company has no current source of revenue therefore the company has not yet adopted any policy regarding the recognition of revenue or cost income taxes the company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment   net loss per share basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period  dilutive loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the losses of the company  because the company does not have any potentially dilutive securities the accompanying presentation is only of basic loss per share f recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no  which eliminated certain financial reporting requirements of companies previously identified as development stage entities topic  the amendments in this asu simplify accounting guidance by removing all incremental financial reporting requirements for development stage entities the amendments also reduce data maintenance and for those entities subject to audit audit costs by eliminating the requirement for development stage entities to present inceptiontodate information in the statements of income cash flows and shareholder equity   early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entitys financial statements have not yet been issued public business entities or made available for issuance other entities upon adoption entities will no longer present or disclose any information required by topic   the company has not adopted this standard at this time  future adoption is not considered by management to have any material impact to the financial statements in august  fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  preparation of financial statements  going concern subtopic  disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern under generally accepted accounting principles gaap continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entitys liquidation becomes imminent preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting if and when an entitys liquidation becomes imminent financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with subtopic  presentation of financial statementsliquidation basis of accounting even when an entitys liquidation is not imminent there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern in those situations financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting but the amendments in this update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events  the amendments in this update are effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter early application is permitted  the company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this asu however at the current period management does not believe that it has met conditions which would subject these financial statements for additional disclosure the company has evaluated all the recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the companys financial statement note   capital stock the company is authorized to issue an aggregate of  common shares with a par value of  per share  no preferred shares have been authorized or issued  at september    common shares are issued and outstanding on september   the company issued  founders shares at  per share par value for total cash of  on september   the company issued  shares for services provided since inception  these shares were issued at par value  per share for services valued at  at september   there are no warrants or options outstanding to acquire any additional shares of common stock of the company note   income taxes we did not provide any current or deferred us federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception accounting for uncertainty in income taxes when it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the company must allow for this future tax benefit  we provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset consisting of net operating loss carry forwards because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period f the components of the companys deferred tax asset and reconciliation of income taxes computed at the statutory rate to the income tax amount recorded as of  is as follows     september   net operating loss     effective tax rate      deferred tax assets      less  valuation allowance      net deferred tax assets     the net federal operating loss carry forward will expire in   this carry forward may be limited upon the consummation of a business combination under irc section  note   related party transactions in support of the companys efforts and cash requirements it has relied on advances from its sole shareholder until such time that the company can support its operations through merger or acquisition or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing the sole shareholder has pledged his support to fund continuing operations however there is no written commitment to this effect  the company is dependent upon this continued support  amounts shown represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities the advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note they are noninterest bearing and payable on demand  at september   the shareholder has paid expenses on behalf of the company in the amount of  which is represented in the shares issued for cash the company has limited need for office facilities and does not own or lease property or lease office space the office space used by the company was arranged by the sole shareholder of the company to use at no charge the company does not have employment contracts with its key employees including the sole shareholder who is the sole officer of the company the amounts and terms of the above transactions may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts and terms that would have been incurred had comparable transactions been entered into with independent third parties note   commitments and contingencies the companys operations are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including financial operational and regulatory risks  the company may not find suitable merger or acquisition opportunities therefore there is the potential risk of business failure from time to time the company may be a party to litigation matters involving claims against the company  management believes that there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the companys financial position or results of operations note   subsequent events management has evaluated subsequent events through january   the date the financial

currently exists for shares of our common stock  following completion of this offering we intend to apply to have our common stock listed for quotation on the overthecounter bulletin board penny stock rules the securities and exchange commission has adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks  penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system a purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock  the shares offered by this prospectus constitute penny stock under the securities and exchange act  the shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future  the classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a brokerdealer to sell the stock into a secondary market which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate herher investment  any brokerdealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares will be subject to rules g through g of the securities and exchange act  rather than creating a need to comply with those rules some brokerdealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document which · contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stock in both public offerings and secondary trading · contains a description of the broker  s or dealer  s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the securities act of  as amended · contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including  bid  and  ask  price for the penny stock and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price · contains a tollfree number for inquiries on disciplinary actions · defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks and · contains such other information and is in such form including language type size and format as the securities and exchange commission shall require by rule or regulation · the brokerdealer also must provide prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock to the customer · the bid and offer quotations for the penny stock · the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction · the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock and · monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account  in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgement of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement  these disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules  therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their securities regulation m our officer and director who will offer and sell the shares is aware that he is required to comply with the provisions of regulation m promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended  with certain exceptions regulation m precludes the officers and directors sales

maximum amount of funds that mr conforte has agreed to provide  mr conforte has access to funds to meet the obligations in the discussion  mr conforte because he is the sole officer and director and although he has orally agreed to fund such amounts as the sole officer and director such agreement is not binding and therefore it is within his sole discretion to provide such funds  mr conforte has agreed to advance the funds to the company and does not expect repayment of the funds as they will be booked as capital contribution  the company is currently operating out of office space provided by

forwardlooking statements including but not limited to variability of our revenues and financial performance risks associated with technological changes the acceptance of our products in the marketplace by existing and potential customers disruption of operations or increases in expenses due to our involvement with litigation or caused by civil or political unrest or other catastrophic events general economic conditions government mandates and the continued employment of our key personnel and other risks associated with competition pc mobile media corp was formed in the state of nevada on august   we are a development stage company with a plan of operation that offers mobile billboard display advertising our planned initial market will primarily occur in the las vegas area we plan to conduct our business operations out of an administrative office provided by our director plan of operation the companys mission is to get our clients message to the right audience at the right time targeting the right audience at the right time is becoming increasingly difficult for advertisers society in general has become more mobile and sophisticated at handling multiple tasks consequently we are tuning out unnecessary or unwanted information including certain print media and radio advertisements alternative media is everywhere from product advertisements on the floors of grocery stores to audio monitors on gas station pumps and popup ads on automated teller machines pc mobile media takes the advertisers message to the target audience anytime anywhere our planned  x  fourcolor banners will get the attention of your target market by traveling along strategically chosen routs or penetrating and setting up stationary at special events or at specific locations whether the client is geographically specific such as local political campaigns or a national product that seeks maximum exposure pc mobile media takes the message to the customer   results of operations for

administrative expenses for the three months ended december   were  as compared to  for the three months ended december   general and administrative expenses increased because the company incurred expenses related to the increase in audit and transfer agent fees professional fees professional fees for the three months ended december   were  as compared to  for the three months ended december   general and administrative expenses decreased because the company did not incur the additional legal fees related to the initial s filing liquidity and capital resources we measure our liquidity in a number of ways including the following as of as of december   september   cash and cash equivalents     working capital deficit   liabilities   the company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations these factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern in order to continue as a going concern the company will need among other things additional capital resources impact of inflation we believe that the rate of inflation has had negligible effect on our operations we believe we can absorb most if not all increased noncontrolled operating costs by increasing sales prices whenever deemed necessary and by operating our company in the most efficient manner possible net cash used in operating activities we experienced negative cash flow from operating activities for the three months ended december

price of  per share pc mobile media corp closed its offering on june   and raised  by placing  through its offering management has been successful in raising  in funds from its offering and which is budgeted to sustain operations for a twelvemonth period if we begin to generate profits we will increase our marketing and sales activity accordingly the company currently has  in cash to meet its current obligations requiring additional capital for operating cash flow as of our quarter ending december   our auditor has expressed substantial doubt for continuation as a going concern at december   the company is in contract with  drink llc to provide mobile billboard advertising services at  per month the company as a whole may continue to operate at a loss for an indeterminate period thereafter depending upon the performance of its business in the process of carrying out its business plan the company will continue to identify new financial partners and investors however it may determine that it cannot raise sufficient capital in the future to support its business on acceptable terms or at all accordingly there can be no assurance that any additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all the company is authorized to issue  shares of common stock we have no known demands or commitments and are not aware of any events or uncertainties as of december   that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially increase or decrease our current liquidity critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap applied on a consistent basis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from these estimates our significant estimates and assumptions include amortization the fair value of our stock and the valuation allowance relating to the companys deferred tax assets   we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act which became law in april  under the jobs act emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies material commitments there were no material commitments during the three months ended december   purchase of furniture and equipment we purchased no equipment during the three months ended december   recent accounting pronouncements from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued that we adopt as of the specified effective date we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective may have an impact on our results of operations and financial position asu update  revenue from contracts with customers topic  issued may   by fasb and iasb converged guidance on recognizing revenue in contracts with customers on an effective date after december   will be evaluated as to impact and implemented accordingly in august  the fasb issued asu no  disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern the amendments require management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements the standard applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after december   with early adoption permitted the company has evaluated the impact that this new guidance will have and has included the appropriate disclosures in note  to these financial statements in february  the fasb issued asu no  leases to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions this asu will require organizations that lease assets lessees to recognize a lease liability and a rightofuse asset on its balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than twelve months a lease liability is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis and a rightofuse asset represents the lessees right to use or control use of a specified asset for the lease term the amendments in this asu simplify the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities this asu leaves the accounting for the organizations that own the assets leased to the lessee lessor largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and topic  revenue from contracts with customers the amendments in asu  are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years lessees for capital and operating leases and lessors for salestype direct financing and operating leases must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements the modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach the company is evaluating the potential impact of asu  on its financial statements   off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure under this section is not required for a smaller reporting company item  controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file under the securities exchange act of  the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commissions rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer being the same person to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures managements report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule af or df promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and financial officer and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   the companys management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december   in making this assessment the companys management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework the coso framework is based upon five integrated components of control control environment risk assessment control activities information and communications and ongoing monitoring based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the companys management the companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the exchange act were not effective as of december   the evaluation date to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to the companys management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure each of the following is deemed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting · we do not have an audit committee while we are not currently obligated to have an audit committee including a member who is an audit committee financial expert as defined in item  of regulation sk under applicable regulations or listing standards however it is managements view that such a committee is an important internal control over financial reporting the lack of which may result in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of internal controls and procedures · we did not maintain proper segregation of duties for the preparation of our financial statements we currently have only one officer overseeing all transactions this has resulted in several deficiencies including the lack of control over preparation of financial statements and proper application of accounting policies management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in the two items above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods managements remediation initiatives in an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls we plan to initiate the following series of measures once we have the financial resources to do so · we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us and we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee which will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us · management believes that the appointment of outside directors to a fully functioning audit committee would remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee   changes in internal control over financial reporting

by paragraph d of rules a and d under the exchange act that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting this quarterly report
