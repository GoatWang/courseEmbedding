in an interview in the ornate firstfloor salons of the thcentury hôtel de fontpertuis that the jeweler occupies on the place vendôme “practically that means you must be able to invest tens of millions in precious stones and really believe in what you are doing“after the war my father was able to purchase quantities of natural and untreated stones in ceylon and burma” he said referring to today’s sri lanka and myanmar “the reza house currently possesses one of the world’s largest inventories of unheated and untreated colored gemstones when you sit on a fortune like that you need vision and passion and you cannot be in a hurry”he added “we liberated ourselves from retail pressure to concentrate on creation now we have the luxury of time and can take eight to  months to produce a piece

legend by jean raffertymarch   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo olivier reza at the jewelry house’s thcentury salon on the place vendôme in paris credit dmitry kostyukov for the new york times paris — successfully reviving a legend is not easy but for olivier reza son of the renowned gem dealer and master jeweler alexandre reza the house’s renaissance over the last eight years has been a crusadehe closed retail outlets worldwide to concentrate on creativity in the reza atelier and its gilded thcentury salon in the hôtel de fontpertuis on the place vendôme here home of many of jewelry’s major namesin  mr reza put together a traveling exhibition a mix of his father’s pieces and his own new contemporary designs to announce the comeback of the reza brandand in august he opened reza at the ritz a boutique with a smooth modern look at the recently renovated luxury hotel while the hotel gallery that links the place vendôme to the cambon side is lined with jewelstuffed vitrines reza is one of only two jewelers with a boutique there and it now is the house’s only public retail space advertisement continue reading the main story “the ritz is a symbol of savoirvivre and savoirfaire the right place for us to provide some visibility on our creations” mr reza  said during an interview in the house’s salon just steps away continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story while he continues to use some of the large collection of flawless natural and untreated gemstones that his father collected over the years mr reza has been developing the house’s artistic direction in his own style — putting more emphasis on design which he said he considers as important as the quality of the stones in creating jewelry“design is always a challenge” he said “it’s like a fight between the stone and the design each time when the stone beats the design i’m not satisfied the design has to hold its own”when a friend and client who had commissioned a ring for his wife asked “am i am buying the stone or the design” mr reza said he felt his design emphasis had been vindicated “in this case the design was up against a beautiful dcolor golconda carat diamond” mr reza said “beat that” photo at reza tiara earrings with diamonds and pigeonblood rubies from mozambique credit dmitry kostyukov for the new york times mr reza’s way of designing is as much madetomeasure as the finished pieces there are no collections each piece is created as he is inspiredmost of his work centers on unique pieces like the arlequin a pair of diamondstudded pendant earrings with brazilian sugarloaf emeralds it is one of his transformable designs the earrings can be clipped together and worn as a brooch another piece the horn of plenty earrings has cascades of pigeonblood rubies and diamondsboth the arlequin and the horn of plenty were presented at the european fine art fair earlier this month in the netherlands the house exhibits at such prestigious art fairs three or four times a yearrecently he added a focus on haute jewelry that uses smaller but still highquality stones to create pieces priced at less than  about  euros advertisement continue reading the main story “they catch your eye and are surprising but also must be beautiful” he said of the haute jewelry which “corresponds to the time we live in”rather than designs targeted at daytime nighttime or special events he has conceived of pieces that are wearable anytime anywhere newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please

sapphires rubies emeralds or colored diamonds and seem to dance up the ear “they attract a lot of attention and do exactly what i want them to do” he said “they are easily wearable but very different and make a statement about the woman who is wearing them”“the designs can be simple” mr reza said “but they have to maximize the beauty of the stone for me it’s all about shape colors composition and contact with the materials and the need to provide an emotion at every angle”another is the diamondstudded spirale ring which looks like an abstract sculpture in miniature and seems to reflect the creative inspiration of his own art collection “there is no art form that i don’t like” he said “i love contemporary modern and old master paintings i love sculptures antiquities african and precolumbian art” photo the dune cuff bracelet credit dmitry kostyukov for the new york times the reza hallmark — the creation of important pieces showcasing sumptuous precious stones — still is celebrated mr reza brought out the dentelle or lace necklace as a spectacular example“i wanted something delicate but complex” he said of the dentelle design the intricate pattern is centered on an extremely rare and flawless emeraldcut carat octagonal oldmine colombian emerald with one lozengecut and two marquisecut zambian emeralds there also are trapezecut diamonds and brilliants arranged in a setting of white yellow and black for contrast goldthe setting was sent to cutters who tailored each jewel to fit the design such pieces can take  to  months to completein every reza design “there is artistic composition but the other thing that doesn’t get enough credit is functionality” mr reza said “it needs to be wearable on the human body where it is constantly in motion these pieces need to be worn — on an ear on a hand as a necklace — so you can see what they were made to be” advertisement continue reading the main story rather than scale models which jewelers traditionally used in designing now d printed versions are made to assure each piece will be both comfortable and beautifulmr reza has a lot to live up to his moscowborn father whose family fled the russian revolution came to paris after world war ii and was soon renowned for his ability to discover exceptional oldmine gemstones from colombia india burma now myanmar thailand and sri lanka“he founded his own house in the s and soon was trading and making jewelry for all the big place vendôme names” mr reza said “then he opened his place vendôme store in ”as he traveled alexandre reza gathered rare oldmine diamonds emeralds sapphires and rubies that remarkable collection said to be among the world’s largest was the reason olivier reza abandoned a successful career as an investment banker to take over the business when his father retired “the most important aspect is the gems waiting to be alive again” he said “i realized i had a huge head start”but mr reza still has some of a banker’s sensibility jewels are the safest investment he said “a beautiful emerald or ruby never goes out of fashion”“my only advice is to buy the best” he said continue reading the main story we’re interested in your

hallmarks of the collections by this jewelry dynasty that has decided to return to the biennale des antiquaires after  years though it has participated three times in the past alexandre reza has a refined knowledge of rare precious gems and it is his name on the famous boutique in place vendôme the torch has been passed to his son olivier who worked by his father’s side from the time he was a child in an important moment of change and affirmation the biennale represents a significant step along a new path the first time the spotlight has been shone on the brand internationally since its relaunch  months ago olivier reza worked for four years on the creation of about  luxurious pieces inspired by the world of art by henri matisse’s paintings and robert lazzarini sculptures the collection also features pieces that fully embody alexandre reza’s philosophy which seeks out beauty with extremely high quality stones excellent manufacture and a recognizable style – and brought up to date with a more contemporary feel in terms of creativity it’s natural to compare the masterpieces of yesterday and today to come to the conclusion that they are products of the same philosophy in terms of the size of the jewels the same attention to the proportions of the stone and the same use of the most sophisticated working methods like the “en tremblant” technique carried out by the father and now the son to offer a bit of movement to the individual pieces that bring a jewel to life di maristella campi published     add comment  last on vogue vogue artsvittoria mentasti  dead
