nongaap results to gaap has been posted on falconstors website at wwwfalconstorcom under investor relations after the close of business today falconstor released its q  earnings copies of the earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on falconstors website at wwwfalconstorcom i am now pleased to turn the call over to gary quinn gary quinn thank you operator good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the falconstor q  earnings call as we continue to move forward with the adoption of freestor with new and existing customers we were able to achieve one of our goals towards financial stability in  which was a cash flow positive quarter dan will give you a little update later in the presentation about our financial performance just to remind it to everyone that this is our safe harbor statement and secondly just to remind everyone that  on the next slide just to remind everyone that freestor which started in  is delivering upon the requirements that enterprises and cloud service providers are facing in todays marketplace we continued to evolve the freestor product to support the storage destinations of today whether that is allflash arrays onpremise local data centers or the use of publicprivate and hybrid cloud configurations the freestor product was built to not  to be not only a hardware agnostic but is now cloud agnostic to permit the movement of customer workloads to the appropriate destination for hardware storage performance service level objectives or for the best economic benefit freestor gives customers the ability to choose the right destination for the right workload and as you can see from this slide the innovation upon which freestor is delivering at quite an incredible pace which is not only featurerich but with the quality that enterprises and cloud service providers demand just last week we announced our fourth update to the freestor product which all of our customers will receive without any additional cost provided that they have an active license for the product next slide id like to turn over the presentation to dan to review our operating performance for the quarter weve changed our format a bit to support more insight to the performance of freestor versus our legacy products we hope that we have addressed a number of your requests for more information and insight dan daniel murale thank you gary and good afternoon to everyone most of our discussions this afternoon will focus on nongaap financial measures and on the key business performance indicators for the quarter the balance of our financial details can be found in our press release which was distributed earlier today which contains our yearoveryear results and the applicable disclosures in accordance with gaap during the first quarter of  bookings totaled  million compared with  million in the previous quarter and  million in the first quarter of  our consolidated gaap revenue totaled  million in the quarter and decreased  compared with  million in both the previous quarter and the first quarter of  during the quarter we had one customer which accounted for  or more of our total revenue hds which was  of our total revenue during the quarter we realized the full impact of our cost rationalization initiatives undertaken during  and as a result our nongaap expenses which exclude restructuring charges and sharebased compensation expense decreased to  million compared with  million in the previous quarter and  million in the prior year a  and  decrease respectively we ended the quarter with  employees worldwide compared with  employees at the same period last year we continually look to optimize our cost structure in order to preserve our cash balance our nongaap operating loss was  million in the current quarter compared with  million in the previous quarter and  million in the first quarter of  our nongaap gross margins increased to  in the current quarter compared with  in the previous quarter and  in the first quarter of  turning to our balance sheet we were pleased that we achieved our goal of being cash flow positive for the quarter as of march  our cash and cash equivalents balance increased  to  million as compared with december   our number one goal as a company is to continue to preserve our cash balance now i would like to discuss our freestor performance as you can see from the slide over the last  quarters since freestors release we are gaining traction with our freestor platform total freestor bookings for the first quarter of  was  million compared with  million in the previous quarter and  million for the first quarter of  total freestor revenue for the first quarter of  was  million compared with  million in the previous quarter and  million for the first quarter of  a  and  increase respectively we now have  active customers utilizing the freestor technology representing an increase of  compared with december   and  compared with march   now i would like to turn the call back over to gary gary quinn thank you dan for those comments and insight i believe you can see from these updated charts that although our overall performance still requires some improvement we have been able to grow freestor but just not at a rate which is faster than the legacy product weakening many of our legacy customers were larger vtl customers whove chosen to update their backup solutions to a modern snapshot technology to achieve a faster backup and recovery performance in many cases those vtl customers were part of a fieldbased oem hardware partners sales team which meant falconstor did not have direct contact to those customers therefore the customer may not have known that falconstor could have provided them with both a modern snapshot backup and recovery technology as well as a traditional backup software solution which was exported out to physical and virtual tape library or to the cloud with our new release of freestor those customers who purchase freestor in the future for physical or virtual tape library functionality will also have access to our snapshot backup and recovery technology or the ability to store tape in amazon or azure at no additional cost which should help us to preserve those customers for the future in addition the legacy maintenance costs are significantly higher than newer licensing model under freestor and as customers are looking to optimize their spending by the use of the cloud and more economic destinations legacy products not only from falconstor but from others in the industry are seeing increasing pressure to lower those exorbitant maintenance fees freestor can alleviate those economic pressures with its subscription licensing and payasyougrow primary copyonly trueup model as we look at the primaryuse cases of freestor were seeing that customers are beginning to use freestor for more than just one use case the reason for the more than  total in the chart which a positive trend for us and our customers many customers will start out with a singleuse case such as disaster recovery or dr as a service if youre a service provider and then addon additional use cases such as continuity or it resiliency because they need a higher level of availability or  downtime versus minimal downtime additionally customers may use freestor to migrate from disk to flash sitetosite or sitetocloud and once completed they may want to add a level of data protection using freestor versus buying another new solution or a legacy solution from another vendor due to priceperformance with freestor all of these freestor indicators show that freestor is the right product for the marketplace finally the number of customers using freestor for their storage needs continues to grow as you saw from our previous slides and more companies are relying upon freestor to deliver the flexibility they need to store their company information in the most reliable economical and flexible destination so hopefully you can see that we continue to grow with freestor we continue to adjust our expense levels to match the performance of that freestor growth and we believe with the introduction of our latest release we have a path forward for those legacy virtual tape library customers which will begin to slow the dwindling of those customers the number of new customers customer conversions and expansion of those existing freestor customers provides a bright light for those of us here at falconstor and with that operator can you please compile the qa roster questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we will take our first question form bill dawkins of burlison bill dawkins can you give me any idea on when we will begin to see sequential growth for falconstor as a whole gary quinn sequential growth on a gaap revenue perspective or just inside the actual freestor product or the overall product bookings or billings bill dawkins well do freestor and overall i mean just a sequential growth in the revenues instead of continuing to see the revenues decline when will we begin to see the revenues grow gary quinn dan do you want to answer that or can you see that in the model i mean the deferred model is making up the most of the  i mean the deferred makes up most of our revenue as we go forward in this point we dont really have that much coming from the individual quarter based upon a subscription basis of freestor and the freestor technology let me do a little more work on that so we can see where we can model that out for you guys and give you some projections on that as we move forward okay bill dawkins and whats the current market like out there is it still hazy gary quinn you could say youre kind of underwater in a pond with a lot of algae at the moment with a snorkel its still fairly tough i mean there are a couple of people  i mean i think if you saw it yesterday i mean i think commvault had a pretty good result last quarter i think theyve finally got some traction going but i think overall for most people in the storage industry i think its still a fairly significant slog out there at some point its got to open up i mean its been going on for a little over a year now and at some point youve got to get  theres got to be some more opening up and some relief maybe its due to a little more clearness on the suppliers that are out there what they can supply i mean the surprising thing for us as we continue to add freestor customers both new and conversions we also didnt mention  i didnt mention in my notes that we also added another oem in china which gives us  so thats a really good positive for us and we had a number of folks also in the united states in q which has kind of been lagging the rest of world in freestor new or freestor conversions those started to happen this quarter so i think  i mean for us as you could see in those charts whats really kind of the problem for us is the legacy large customers that have kind of rolled off over time and theyre primarily from our relationships with hitachi i mean hitachi is selling our retail product through their sales organization we did not have a lot of visibility to that but they were somewhat large and hitachi is unfortunately enough has kind of moved them if they wanted to move to something else or whats happening a lot also is emc took a lot of footprint in the last  to  months from people prior to the finalization of the dellemc transaction so it wasnt really our fault it was in a lot of cases we were a part of the transaction from hitachi and hitachi got swept out of the counter off the floor but i think its converging and the idea would be is to keep working at that and get a crossover of freestor from the legacy and see the legacy actually start to stabilize to more of a flatter line at some point in the graph bill dawkins and remind me the sequential  or the seasonality of the quarters again two and  are good and  and  are tough gary quinn thats usually how it goes yes bill dawkins whats q been looking like gary quinn its looking all right i mean its similar i mean but i think its looking all right i mean this freestor activity is there and its going along and a couple of things positive things did happen actually is that coming back to the same people who kind of caused a little problem with us on the vtl side from   with those big customers those guys actually have come back to start selling some product again from freestor and theyve actually  from falconstor and actually have sold some freestor for us so well see if that can keep up into this quarter and beyond to the rest of the year operator operator instructions well go next to john zaro of bcm john zaro on new freestor customers the acceleration of growth on that seems to have slowed in the latest quarter is that just marketplace circumstance sales force if im reading your chart  if im reading your thing right daniel murale yes so some of that is the perpetual licenses that we sell through freestor so those sales could be a little lumpy quartertoquarter but the freestor subscription sales have increased quarteroverquarter john zaro right but they were going along at a fairly good clip and then this latest quarter it looks like it was a little slower and im just wondering if thats a circumstance or its actually slowed a little bit gary quinn it might have looked like it might have slowed a little bit i mean dan just said that they were talking about a couple of hundred thousand dollars difference quartertoquarter john zaro right yeah i was just looking at the number of people gary quinn yes i mean well the numbers when you speak of the numbers could be is that we had a couple of larger initial transactions versus  multiple small guys versus one or  larger guys john zaro and with changes of basically your employees and sales force and at one point we were seeing virtually nothing for united states is that  are those things sort of clearing themselves up or is that still problematic gary quinn actually overall last quarter i mean to give you a little color on the geography is the us actually had a very good quarter last quarter which  id wait until i see a little bit more of trend on that john but we did have a very good quarter last quarter in the united states including things related to the united states not just the enterprise customers but also around our alliances business in the us and in our latin america business so overall the americas was very good the european business we were good in the uk ireland area we were also good in the southern area which includes france italy and spain we had some challenges in germany last quarter we had some challenges in china and both of those are large markets for us but everywhere else in the world southeast asia japan for the most part we were  we met all of our internal targets but at the moment we have a little trouble in germany in china i think china always has an issue with the new year with the chinese new year theres a lot of inconsistencies time off et cetera sometimes weve caught a few things i think a year ago we did  oem transactions there in the first quarter which may have kind of made us overlook a little bit what the overall china business is so depending on how those oems come through whether its the freestor oems or the huawei oem relationship our outside traditional var relationships there are probably about  of our business but the oems are a little  almost  and if we kind of time that correctly we kind of get a little softness so thats what happened there i think germany was just a bit of a stumble for us but theyre  large markets for us the rest of the world the americas has actually had an exceptional performance but i think ill kind of wait another quarter or two before we see it as the trend john zaro and is that a  does the germany and china not as has happened before a sales force issue its more of just circumstance gary quinn more circumstances in the market i mean there was a couple of transactions in germany that we thought were going to come in but came in at  either came in at a smaller amount or did not come in at all and pushed off so a little bit of that could be due to the current situation obviously with us as a company too i mean we are facing some headwinds now more frequently with customers that are a little more  do a little more due diligence especially on larger transactions so whats happening is smaller transactions tend to kind of pass through people are not performing a lot of due diligence when you kind of get into for us sixfigure deals and once in a while a sevenfigure deal the due diligence goes up and then the red flags go up a little bit so we wind up getting a little bit less of a transaction or we get a push on the transaction and people contemplate whether or not they should take the risk or not john zaro and thats due to the cash balance and the size of the company gary quinn yes i mean i think last quarter i mean the cash balance  i think what happens is some of the recent things that happened most people run a db check internationally and obviously the going concern that showed up last quarter has shown up through db and so that kind of causes a little extra work on our behalf or basically downsizing the transaction a bit john zaro all right okay and as far as sort of looking at trying to help yourself on that is it still an ongoing process gary quinn were just going to have to really thread the needle there john i mean i know thats not the greatest answer but thats the situation that were in operator operator instructions and it appears we have no further questions at this time gary quinn thank you operator just like to say thank you very much for joining our call and supporting us as a company and we look forward to updating you again on our next call which will be at the beginning of august thank you
