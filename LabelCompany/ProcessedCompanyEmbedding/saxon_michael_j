day as the xslt  recommendation the most stable version is version  first released on  november  and regularly updated with maintenance releases there are several editions of saxon currently maintained saxonhe home edition is an open source product available under the mozilla public license version  it provides implementations of xslt  xquery  and xpath  and  at the basic level of conformance defined by wc it is available for java and net saxonpe professional edition is a commercial product available at modest prices from saxonica limited it adds a number of features to saxonhe including support for saxon extensions and extensibility mechanisms support for optional features defined in xslt  and xquery  including higherorder functions integration with the icuj library to provide localization for different languages and support for external object models such as jdom xom domj and axiom it is available for java and net saxonee enterprise edition is the fullyfeatured commercial product saxonee  offers a complete implementation of the xslt  recommendation published on  june  as well as a fully conformant xsd  and xsd  schema processor and support for schemaaware xslt and xquery processing it offers many other features including streaming in xslt and xquery support for xquery updates an advanced query optimizer compilation of xquery and xslt code to java bytecode multithreaded execution and much more for full details see the saxonica web site it is available for java and net saxonjs javascript edition provides xslt  running in the browser stylesheets are compiled into stylesheet export files using saxonee and can then be executed in the browser it runs in all modern browsers with javascript enabled saxonc is currently at version  it offers the same core functionality as the saxonhe product but crosscompiled into a native executable library dll on windows so on linux with a ccompatible api plus a php extension enabling it to be invoked from php applications details can be found on the project page saxon  on java requires java  also known as jdk  or later it is not supported on java  jdk  saxon  on net requires net framework  or later users have reported that it also works on mono but we do not run tests on this platform a comparison of the features available in different editions of the saxon product is available a detailed history of changes in successive releases is available current releases saxonee  the commercial enterprise edition from saxonica supporting xslt  xpath  and  xquery  xml schema  and  and xquery update  all current releases are listed on the saxonica download page source code for saxonee is not available except to saxonica development partners saxonpe  the commercial professional edition from saxonica supporting xslt  xpath  and  and xquery  it omits support for some optional features of these specifications notably schema awareness and in the case of xslt  streaming all current releases are listed on the saxonica download page source code for saxonpe is not available except to saxonica development partners saxonhe  the opensource implementation of xslt  xpath  and  and xquery  this provides the basic conformance level of these languages it also supports some optional features of the specifications such as serialization and support for xquery modules not included in the home edition are schema processing and schema aware xslt and xquery support for higherorder functions support for xpath  and xslt  backwards compatibility mode numerous saxon extensions calling out to java methods xquery update support various optimizations including join optimization streamed processing multithreaded execution and byte code generation there are four files available a zip file containing executable code for the java platform a exe installer for the net platform a resources file containing documentation and sample applications applicable to both platforms and a zip archive of the source code for both platforms documentation is also available online download for java  mbytes download for net  mbytes download documentation and samples  mbytes available shortly source code for saxonhe  mbytes recent saxonhe releases can also be downloaded from maven see maven repository at the time of writing saxon  is more stable and mature than saxon  so users who do not require the new features of  may prefer to stick with  for a few months longer the current maintenance release on the  branch is  since saxon  the subversion repository for source code is no longer maintained in sourceforge but on the saxonica site at httpsdevsaxonicacomreposarchiveopensource the repository does not contain the development branch of the code only versions that have been released it is the best way of obtaining bug fixes quickly if you are prepared to build the product from source which is not for the fainthearted note that bug fixes are typically made available in subversion as soon as they are available and are then consolidated periodically into a maintenance release source code under development is not held in subversion and is not available until a tested release is issued sometimes prereleases of new facility releases are made available for testing these are announced on the saxonhelp mailing list but will not generally be advertised here older releases of saxonhe remain available from sourceforge see the sourceforge download page for details if you require a release that is no longer listed please ask we cant offer to support it but in general we dont mind you using it at your own risk saxonjs  saxonjs is the javascript edition of saxon offering xslt  running in the browser it supersedes the earlier saxonce product for information about the product see the saxonjs home page bugs forums and discussion lists the bug tracker for all versions of saxon is a redmine database hosted at saxonicaplanio you are free to enter new bugs here directly or if bugs are raised by other routes such as the mailing list we will register them there if they need to be tracked the redmine database also offers discussion forums and these are the best way to raise technical issues or questions that need an answer from the saxonica development team the sourceforge project hosts a mailing list saxonhelp which provides a good way of reaching other saxon users since sourceforge is dedicated to open source we dont encourage use of this list for issues specific to the commercial versions of the product if you need help using the underlying languages xslt xquery xsd etc and the problem is not specific to saxon its better to use a general forum rather than a saxon community resource the stackoverflow site is the best place to get a good answer to straight coding questions while the xsllist also known as the mulberry list is the place for deeper discussions about the nature of xslt as a language to search the history of previous questions and answers on these lists the database maintained at markmail is the most comprehensive and most readily searchable please try to avoid contacting saxonica developers by personal email while we love to help its much easier to manage the correspondence through an archived forum older products saxonb saxonhe does not offer all the capabilities that were present in saxonb most notably support for saxon extension functions and other extensions was dropped as was the capability for writing extension functions that rely on dynamic loading of java or net code a new facility for integrated extension functions is however available users whose code relies on these features of saxonb should either purchase the professional edition product or stick with saxonb the latest release of saxonb is  and although there are no plans to develop it further or maintain it it will remain available indefinitely saxonb version  is a complete and conformant implementation of the xslt  xquery  and xpath  recommendations published on  january  by wc saxonb  is available on both the java and net platforms for the bug fixes in each successive maintenance release see the release notes and change notes for the release on the sourceforge downloads page it can be downloaded from download for java  mbytes download for net  mbytes download source code for   mbytes download documentation and samples  mbytes note this file was first issued with saxonb  and the url reflects this the source code present in this file is the source of  saxon  the saxon xslt  processor remains available the latest version is  however even if your stylesheets only require xslt  it is probably better to run them under saxon x this product is mature and stable and further developments are very unlikely the download includes documentation source code java executables and sample code known limitations of this release are listed here this page will be updated with information about any new bugs that come to light information limitations uptodate list of known bugs download  kbytes saxon  the previous release of saxons implementation of xslt  this product remains available because it runs in some environments that are not supported by saxon  notably under jdk  the download includes documentation source code java executables and sample code known limitations of this release are listed here no further updates will be made to this page information download  kbytes instant saxon  the most recent version of the instant saxon product instant saxon was built using the same source code as saxon  but was packaged for ease of installation when using the microsoft java vm since the microsoft java vm has long ceased to be a standard component of the windows platform this release has outlived its usefulness but it remains available for download for those of an antiquarian disposition information download  kbytes old products ant task for saxon there is a custom ant task for invoking saxon xslt transformations this was previously issued as part of the saxon product but has now been separated into a separate package under the saxon sourceforge project it is no longer actively developed and is not recommended there are a number of bugs and it is difficult to improve the quality because of an absence of test material the download is here ælfred the ælfred xml parser that was bundled with saxon versions up to version  is available as a separate download it is of historic interest only dtdgenerator also available on this site is the dtdgenerator program this was formerly produced as a saxon demonstration application but has since been adapted to work as a pure sax application with no dependencies on the saxon software documentation for earlier releases remains present on the sourceforge web site                      for releases from  onwards the documentation is not available directly on the web site but can be obtained by downloading the software michael h kay  june  robot check enter the
