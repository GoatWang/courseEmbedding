application is also related to that of the present assignees other issued patents us pat nos        and          and field of the invention the present invention relates to methods and systems for inconspicuously marking utilitarian objects eg microprocessors compact disks pharmaceutical tablets bolts and hardware wristwatches automotive components etc with digital data background and summary of the invention sometimes things are not what they seem an intel integrated circuit sold by a local computer shop as a  mhz pentium ii may have been a  mhz pentium ii when it left the intel factory a defense contractor who ordered a speciallytested  bolt for use in a demanding aerospace application may be supplied with an inferior  cent bolt instead many enterprises suffer by such fraudulent product substitution considering more particularly the integrated circuit case ic manufacturers rigorously test their chips to assure that published specifications are met under all expected operating conditions a chip that meets specs when operated at  mhz commands a substantial price premium over a chip that meets specs only at  mhz commonly chips with lower speed ratings are produced on the same fabrication lines as chips with top speed ratings but during postfab testing fail to meet the more demanding spec under some extreme of operating conditions eg at stressful ambient conditions marginal power supply potentials etc unscrupulous distributors aware that such chips may meet the higher specs under most conditions sometimes “push” the speed ratings and remark eg a  mhz chip as the much more costly  mhz chip accounts of such duplicity are common the jun   orange county register reported on purchasers who were duped into buying  mhz pentium ii processors for  each instead of their thenprevailing  price thinking they were  or  mhz models three days later an account of such deception appeared in computer dealer news this time involving incidents in germany soon thereafter hong kong customs officials seized hk  million of similarly relabeled pentium ii processors south china morning post aug   large computer companies wary of unscrupulous chip distributors commonly perform their own quality assurance testing of incoming chips this testing is complex costly and timeconsuming but is viewed as necessary in order to assure the quality of the computer companys products one solution to this problem is for the manufacturer to encode—at the conclusion of testing—the chips speed in a writeonce memory eg fusible links formed in the integrated circuitry this data can then be readout by a subsequent purchaser of the chip to determine the original manufacturers intended speed rating such an arrangement is detailed in intels us pat no  while this electricalencoding approach obviates the need for the purchaser to perform its own lengthy quality assurance testing other drawbacks persist for example the purchaser must still remove the chip connector from its staticprotective packaging and mate it with the socket of a reader device in order to discern the encoded speed data so doing exposes the chip to potential static damage thus requiring that this procedure be performed in a highly controlled environment by skilled personnel moreover this approach increases the semiconductor die size and impacts the yield a related approach is to form several eg eight metal traces on or near the exterior of the integrated circuit package and lasercut selected traces to represent one of eg  different product gradesconfigurations such an arrangement is detailed in intels us pat no  while an improvement in some respects over the fusible link approach this latter technique has drawbacks of its own for example the provision of the metal traces on or near the exterior of the package limits packaging options and makes assembly of the package more complex moreover fairly sophisticated inspection equipment must be used to discern these product markings finally both of the foregoing approaches are suitable only with integrated circuits and the like and have no counterpart eg for bolts etc to mark articles other than circuitry a variety of techniques can be used most commonly alphanumeric symbols are printed or otherwise formed on articles permitting identification by inspection however such markings can readily be altered as demonstrated by the remarking of integrated circuits discussed above if a product marking is to be made resistant to tampering a first step is to hide its significance from potential tamperers one way of doing this is to employ computerreadable indicia such as barcodes instead of alphanumeric symbols while bar codes are less likely to invite tampering than alphanumeric symbols they still stand out as product markings still better would be product markings that altogether escape recognition as such various such techniques are known for example numerous patents teach the marking of paper currency lottery tickets and the like with magnetic particles phosphorescent dyes etc such marking permits the authenticity of the articles to be verified but the “bandwidth” of such inconspicuous techniques is quite limited commonly being restricted to a single validinvalid determination moreover most such techniques are illsuited for afterthefact application to an article instead such markings must generally be implemented as part of the articles original formation in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention the foregoing and other drawbacks of the prior art are overcome in an illustrative embodiment the ceramic or plastic housing of an integrated circuit is provided with a textured surface in which digital data is encoded the texturing does not alert the public to the conveyance of data yet tens or hundreds of bits of data can be conveyed the textured surface can be “read” using a handheld scanner without exposing the integrated circuit to possible static damage chip speed together with other encoded data eg date of fabrication place of fabrication size of cache etc can thereby be discerned inspection of chips can be performed quickly by lessskilled personnel and without special environmental controls in some embodiments the texturing is effected through tooling used to produce or modify the packaging in others the texturing is effected by a patterned layer of additional material applied to a smooth surface in still other embodiments the surface is not textured but instead is printed with a seemingly random pattern in which the digital information is encoded these techniques can be applied to any utilitarian object pharmaceuticals compact disks bolts and special hardware automotive parts and wristwatches are just a few other examples the foregoing and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawingsbrief description of the drawings fig  shows an integrated circuit having a textured package according to one embodiment of the present invention fig  detail steps in an encoding process used in one embodiment of the invention fig  is a diagram showing an apparatus used to decode textured product markings according to one embodiment of the invention detailed description of illustrative embodiments referring to fig  an integrated circuit  includes an exterior housing or package  the housing can be formed in numerous ways one is by injection molding another is by known ceramicshaping techniques at some point prior to shipment the surface microtopology of an area  on the housing is shaped in a seemingly random manner the area  can span the entire housing if desired in the preferred embodiments the patterning is substantially uniform across its extent and may look like pebbling mottling graininess or roughness yet this seemingly random surface conveys pluralbit digital information in an illustrative production cycle a semiconductor wafer is processed to form several integrated circuits testing is conducted to determine the speed rating or other grade of each circuit the testing can be done while all the circuits are still on the wafer or after the wafer has been diced into dies or after the dies have been packaged in a housing the housing is shaped with a texture that reflects the test results andor other circuit characteristics the circuits then enter the stream of commerce and eventually end up at a computer manufacturer on receipt the manufacturer checks the circuits grade using a simple handscanner the scanner reflects light from the textured surfaces of the integrated circuit packages producing data that is fed to a microprocessorbased terminal the terminal decodes the data and extracts the encoded information optionally referring to a lookuptable or database to expand coded values into textual descriptions the terminal presents a display of the decoded information eg speed rating date and place of manufacture etc and logs same into an inventory control database if the decoded speed rating is different than that marked on the package the manufacturer can return the circuit to the distributor as being nonconforming in an exemplary embodiment the encoded information is  bits and is broken down into fields as follows bits processor speed  unspecified   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz   mhz through   reservedbits manufacture date coded as day

pentium ii  mobile pentium  pentium ii xeon  celeron through   reserved considering the encoding process in more detail there are many techniques for representing plural bits of binary data in noiselike patterns many rely on spreadspectrum techniques in one technique fig  the binary data is represented as a sequence of “−”s and “”s instead of “”s and “”s the binary data payload can comprise a single datum but more typically comprises several for expository convenience the data payload in the exemplary embodiment comprises  bits more or less bits of course can be used error detectingcorrecting bits can be included if desired a pseudorandom grid pattern also comprised of“−”s and “”s is generated in the exemplary embodiment the pseudorandom grid pattern is × cells as shown in fig c to encode the first element of the grid is multiplied by the first bit of the binary data payload the second element of the grid is multiplied by the second bit of the binary data payload and so forth at the fifth element of the grid the binary data payload has been exhausted so it is recycled from the beginning thus the fifth element of the grid corresponds to the first bit of the payload the second element of the grid corresponds to the second bit of the payload etc the results are shown at fig d this process yields an output grid pattern of“−”s and “”s in which the binary data sequence has been encoded in other embodiments the bits of the binary data payload need not be mapped to successive cells of the pseudorandom grid in rowcolumn order instead any known mapping of payload bits to grid cells can be employed it will be recognized that the binary data payload can be extracted from the output grid pattern by the inverse of the justdescribed operation the values in the output grid pattern are divided by corresponding elements of the same pseudorandom grid pattern yielding a repeated version of the binary data payload sequence after the output grid pattern is determined the pattern is used to texture the surface of the integrated circuit housing if the housing is made by an injection molding process the mold can be etched by a computerdriven etching apparatus each cell in the output grid pattern can correspond eg to a × micron patch on the mold if the output grid pattern in a particular cell has a value of “” a depression can be formed in a corresponding patch on the mold surface if the output grid pattern in a particular cell has a value of “−” no depression is formed the depth of the depressions can depend on aesthetic considerations typical depressions have a depth less than a half millimeter and may be on the order of the patch size  microns or less the resulting pattern of moldpitting is a physical manifestation of the output grid pattern when the mold is used to form an integrated circuit housing the negative of this pattern will be created with each pit resulting in a raised point on the housing the size of the textured region depends on the patch size and the number of rowscolumns in the output grid pattern the larger the textured region the more “signal” is available for decoding and the less exacting can be the specifications of the reading device a textured region about one centimeter on a side has been found to provide more than adequate signal smaller textured regions or larger can be used depending on the application requirements techniques other than computercontrolled etching apparatuses can be used to shape the mold in accordance with the output grid signal a small computercontrolled milling machine can be used so can laser cutting devices while the foregoing approach contemplates that the housing is formed with the texture already on it in other embodiments the housing can be formed with a flat surface and the texturing applied later as by a heated press mold assuming the packaging material is thermoplastic to enhance the “signal” conveyed by the texturing surface changes can be made corresponding to both “” and “−” values in the output pattern grid instead of just corresponding to the “” values as described above thus raised areas are formed in patches corresponding to “” valued output pattern cells and pits are formed corresponding to “−” valued output pattern cells in other embodiments the texturing can also be applied by an additional layer of material applied to the housing in the desired output pattern after the housing has been formed for example a viscous ink can be applied in a screen printing process the screen has an opening where the corresponding cell of the output grid pattern has a “” value and no opening otherwise when the viscous ink is applied through the screen small patches of ink are deposited where the screen had openings but not elsewhere patches larger than  microns may be employed in such embodiments depending on the resolution limitations of the screen printing process the result is again a textured surface with the pattern of raised areas conveying the binary data payload various material other than ink can be applied to form the textured layer on top of the housing thermoplastics and epoxy resins are just two alternatives in some such embodiments techniques other than printing are used to apply a textured layer to the housing for example various photolithographic techniques can be used one technique employs a photoreactive polymer which is applied to the surface and then optically exposed through a mask corresponding to the output grid pattern the exposed polymer is developed thereby removing patches of material in still other embodiments the output grid pattern is printed onto the housing surface in two contrasting colors eg black and white cells having a “” value can be printed in one color and cells having a “−” value can be printed in another in such embodiments the binary payload is not discerned from a pattern of textures but rather from a pattern of contrasting colors in a variant of the foregoing embodiment a single color of ink is employed the color of the housing provides the contrast numerous other microshaping and texturing technologies can similarly be employed as will be familiar to artisans in that field the earlierdescribed algorithm for generating the output grid pattern is exemplary but a great many other encoding algorithms can be used one employs n different frames of pseudorandom values “−” and “” where n is the number of bits in the binary payload the frame can have any size an exemplary frame is an array of × cells each cell again is  microns on a side resulting in a frame size of about  cm× cm a composite frame is formed by summing selected ones of these frames depending on the data payload for example if the data payload is “” then the first and third frames are summed corresponding to the “”s in the first and third bit positions the second and fourth frames can be left unused or can be subtracted from the justformed sum for better signaltonoise ratio the resulting output grid pattern is implemented as a texture or printed pattern on the housing as above to extract the binary data payload from such a composite frame correlation operations are performed between the composite frame and each of the component n frames those component frames that exhibit a high correlation correspond to bit positions having a value of “” in the binary data payload another class of encoding algorithms employs the binary data payload as coefficients representing a pattern transformed to another domain for example if the binary data payload consists of  bits these bits can serve as  dct coefficients thereby uniquely defining a × patch of “” and “−” cells this patch can be replicated as necessary to span the desired area on the housing the mapping between the dct and untransformed domain yields the seeming randomization of the resulting pattern no pseudorandom component is expressly introduced to decode the patch is transformed to the dct domain and the dct coefficients provide the binary data payload in this and the foregoing embodiments it is commonly desirable to provide some synchronization or calibration signal so that the beginning of the binary data payload can be uniquely identified and so as to enable rotationinsensitive detection various such signals and related techniques are disclosed in the assignees earliercited applications and patents in addition to the encoding techniques particularly detailed above essentially any “digital watermarking” “steganography” or “data hiding” technique known in the literature can alternatively be used while such techniques typically embed data into imagery the same techniques can likewise be applied to a “null” image to yield just a data embedding signal in systems that adaptively scale the watermark energy to image contents the scaling function should be omitted since the “image contents” here are null the references cited section of this patent detail many such alternative marking techniques a search of the us patent offices webbased search system using keywords such as “watermark” and “steganogr” will reveal others the artisan is assumed to be familiar with the range of available watermarkingdata hidingsteganography art a detector system  suitable for use with the foregoing embodiments is shown in fig  and includes a handscanner  and a computer  the hand scanner is conventional and includes a linear light source  eg an array of leds with associated lensing a corresponding array of light detectors  eg photodiodes and ad circuitry  the computer includes a microprocessor  a memory  an io port  and an output device  the light source  illuminates a swath of the textured region and the array of light detectors  generates analog signals related to the reflected light these analog signals are periodically sampled and converted into digital form by the ad converters  and the resultant digital data is provided to the io port  stored in memory  of the computer are software instructions causing the microprocessor  to perform a decoding operation on the digital data provided to the io port  in exemplary arrangements the sampled digital data is arrayed in the memory  and analyzed in accordance with a decoding algorithm the decoding algorithm is tailored to correspond to the encoding technique by which the texture was formed the decoding operation outputs the originallyencoded binary data payload the binary data payload can be directly presented for viewing but is preferably first “interpreted” to interpret the payload the component fields are matched with corresponding textual descriptions such as those presented above using a lookuptable stored in memory  or using an associated local or remote database  the resulting textual descriptions are then output to the operator using either a screen display an audio annunciator etc the decoded data is also desirably entered into an inventory control system  noting the date time and location of scanning the foregoing discussion focused on marking of integrated circuit packaging and use of such marking to prevent mislabeling of products however the disclosed techniques are likewise applicable to any other article whose surface can be textured and to applications where true counterfeiting rather than mislabeling is at issue counterfeiting of commercial goods is a longstanding problem as evidenced by sidewalk vendors of “rolex” watches surfaces of watches and other articles can be inconspicuously textured to encode authentication data at ports of entry us customs officials can use handheld scanners to confirm that the texturing encodes the expected data to guard against artful reproduction of texture markings found on authentic goods the encoded data can include a date beyond which importation should not be permitted customs officials encountering articles with expired dates can seize the goods pending an investigation such encoding of expiration date data in hidden embedded data finds other applications as well texturing can also be applied to automotive components to identify or authenticate same for example on new cars vehicle identification numbers presently printed on a dashboard plate and on various components can be encoded in texture form and inconspicuously applied throughout the vehicle including etched onto glass surfaces in small patches the provision of such information in machinereadable form on the exterior of the vehicle enables various downstream scanned databased applications as will be apparent from the foregoing the concepts detailed above are not limited just to integrated circuits but instead can be applied to essentially any article—each with its own set of attendant benefits to provide a comprehensive disclosure without unduly lengthening this specification applicants incorporate by reference the disclosures of the abovecited patents and applications having described and illustrated the principles of our invention with reference to various embodiments thereof it will be recognized that the invention can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from its basic principles for example while the abovedescribed embodiments applied the texture marking to the article itself some applications may be better served by somarking a container in which the article is distributed this can be advantageous for example when the item is textured in aid of an inventory control system—the item can be accurately identified for inventory without opening the container in view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of our technology may be put it should be recognized that the detailed embodiments are illustrative only and should not be taken as limiting the scope of our invention rather we claim as our invention all such embodiments as may come within the scope and spirit of the following claims and equivalents thereto   previous patent
