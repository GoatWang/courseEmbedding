it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high low this funds expenses are rated as low because they are below the th percentile when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should

between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment decisionlearn more fund risk and return as of  morningstar category intermediateterm bond return of this fund within morningstar category low avg high risk of this fund within morningstar category low

basis points the us employment market stayed healthy through the reporting period as the unemployment rate reached an eightyear low of  in january and february before ticking up slightly in march as more people reentered the labor force to search for jobs however firstquarter  us gross domestic product gdp growth was disappointing with the latest available estimate showing that the economy expanded at an annualized rate of only  as consumers remained reluctant to spend inflation stayed stubbornly low although oil prices rallied sharply to over  per barrel at the end of the reporting period after falling below  in january after its initial rate hike in december the fed held interest rates steady through the end of april citing turbulent global financial markets the us treasury yield curve continued to flatten over the course of the reporting period as shortterm yields increased while longermaturity yields decreased fed rate hikes affect the prices of shortmaturity debt more than longerterm bonds bond prices and yields move in opposite directions the yield on the sixmonth treasury bill climbed to  at the end of april from  at the beginning of the reporting period on the other hand the year treasury bonds yield decreased to  from  at the start of november  yields on many other highquality developed markets sovereign debt including some german and japanese government bonds decreased into negative territory boosting demand for relatively highyielding us treasuries bond market news most sectors of the us bond market generated solidly positive returns for the sixmonth period longterm treasuries benefited most from the rally and produced attractive returns corporate bonds also performed well over the course of the reporting period despite selling pressure at the beginning of  with investmentgrade corporates outperforming high yield bonds bonds from energyrelated issuers account for a large percentage of the noninvestmentgrade bond market and lost more ground in the earlyyear rout the rebound in oil prices and in investor sentiment toward asset classes with more credit risk helped support the corporate bond market near the end of the reporting period mortgage and assetbacked securities produced more modest returns portfolio review the fund is designed for investors who want to benefit from broad exposure to investmentgrade bonds its objective is to closely track the performance of the barclays us aggregate bond index after fees but we attempt to compensate for fund expenses by seeking modest additional returns through small variations in sector weightings to a lesser extent typically we also employ what is referred to as curve positioning or duration managementadjustments in the mix of maturities of our holdings based on our view on the direction of interest rates overweight exposure to bonds from several commodityrelated issuers within the portfolios allocation to investmentgrade corporate bonds weighed on relative performance and accounted for the funds underperformance despite the rebound in commodities prices in the latter part of the reporting period general price volatility in corporate bonds in energyrelated sectors dragged down their returns however on the positive side security selection within our allocation to build america bonds which are taxable municipal debt contributed to relative returns   the portfolios duration was slightly longer than the duration of the benchmark which benefited relative performance as intermediate and longterm treasury yields decreased we favor this longduration positioning to add incremental yield as well as to hedge some of the portfolios credit risk the fund is underweight shorter maturities and overweight intermediate and longerterm bonds because we anticipate that the yield curve will continue to flatten as fed rate increases push shortmaturity yields higher the portfolio remained overweight investmentgrade corporate bonds where credit spreads are attractive relative to other sectors with credit risk we are also overweight assetbacked securities which offer strong ties to increasing consumer spending in the improving us economy we continue to favor commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs as real estate fundamentals improve credit spreads on cmbs have reached their widest levels in over two years the prospect of rising interest rates has triggered concerns that some investors could change course and redeploy their assets into other areas of the market pressuring fixed income sectors with limited liquidity net outflows during periods of rising rates are not new indeed such was the case in  and  when rates turned up the market was smaller than it is today however thanks to recent inflows because of this evolving environment t rowe price is taking steps to ensure that our funds function smoothly during transitional periods as the fed makes policy changes that are likely to affect the direction of interest rates these steps include assessing the liquidity of our portfolios conducting stress tests that take various market scenarios into consideration evaluating risk management strategies to determine appropriate actions and taking other measures to ensure the continued smooth operation of our portfolios in our view we do not believe that your fund will be adversely affected by the conditions we have just mentioned but we want to inform our shareholders that we are aware of the changing market environment and are monitoring it closely outlook although us economic growth was disappointingly slow in the first quarter of  we anticipate that consumer spending will pick up and help drive gdp growth for the full year to about  the ongoing improvement in the housing market and increasing government spending should also help support economic growth more than offsetting a contraction in exports inflation should finally begin to rise from its low levels of  and early  and we are starting to see signs of upward pressure on wages as the labor market steadily generates more jobs we continue to think that the pace of fed rate hikes will be measured and gradual relative to historical cycles of monetary policy tightening with the fed likely to act cautiously the transition to higher rates may not be as painful as some fear shortterm yields are likely to feel the most upward pressure as the market prices in the timing and pace of monetary tightening at the longterm end of the yield curve the presence of large institutional buyers and the attractive valuations of us treasuries relative to other developed markets sovereign debt could temper a rise in yields in this volatile changing fixed income environment we will continue to prudently apply some active management techniques to try to generate incremental gains relative to the passive benchmark index our analysts continue to find select opportunities for riskadjusted returns within their areas of focus as always indepth research and careful risk management remain integral to our investment process respectfully submitted robert m larkins president of the fund and chairman of its investment advisory committee may   the committee chairman has daytoday responsibility for managing the portfolio and works with committee members in developing and executing the funds investment program risks of investing in fixed income securities funds that invest in fixed income securities are subject to price declines due to rising interest rates with longterm securities generally most sensitive to rate fluctuations other risks include credit rating downgrades and defaults on scheduled interest and principal payments mortgagebacked securities are subject to prepayment risk particularly if falling rates lead to heavy refinancing activity and extension risk which is an increase in interest rates that causes a funds average maturity to lengthen unexpectedly due to a drop in mortgage prepayments this would increase the funds sensitivity to rising interest rates and its potential for price declines glossary barclays us aggregate bond index an unmanaged index that tracks domestic investmentgrade bonds including corporate government and mortgagebacked securities basis point equivalent to  percentage points commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs bonds backed by loans on commercial rather than residential properties credit spread the additional yield that investors demand to hold a bond with credit risk compared with a treasury security with a comparable maturity date

calculating a funds yield that assumes all portfolio securities are held until maturity yield will vary and is not guaranteed weighted average maturity a measure of a funds interest rate sensitivity in general the longer the average maturity the greater the funds sensitivity to interest rate changes the weighted average maturity may take into account the interest rate readjustment dates for certain securities performance and expenses growth of  this chart shows the value of a hypothetical  investment in the fund over the past  fiscal year periods or since inception for funds lacking year records the result is compared with benchmarks which may include a broadbased market index and a peer group average or index market indexes do not include expenses which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes   fund expense example as a mutual fund shareholder you may incur two types of costs  transaction costs such as redemption fees or sales loads and  ongoing costs including management fees distribution and service b fees and other fund expenses the following example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the most recent sixmonth period and held for the entire period actual expenses the first line of the following table actual provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information on this line together with your account balance to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number on the first line under the heading expenses paid during period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the information on the second line of the table hypothetical is based on hypothetical account values and expenses derived from the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed  per year rate of return before expenses not the funds actual return you may compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund with other funds by contrasting this  hypothetical example and the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period note t rowe price charges an account service fee that is not included in the accompanying table the account service fee is charged on a quarterly basis usually during the last week of a calendar quarter and applies to accounts with balances below  on the day of the assessment the fee is charged to accounts that fall below  for any reason including market fluctuations redemptions or exchanges when an account with less than  is closed either through redemption or exchange the fee is charged and deducted from the proceeds the fee applies to iras but not to retirement plans directly registered with t rowe price services or accounts maintained by intermediaries through nscc ® networking if you are subject to the fee keep it in mind when you are estimating the ongoing expenses of investing in the fund and when comparing the expenses of this fund with other funds you should also be aware that the expenses shown in the table highlight only your ongoing costs and do not reflect any transaction costs such as redemption fees or sales loads therefore the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds to the extent a fund charges transaction costs however the total cost of owning that fund is higher     unaudited the accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements unaudited

established by the funds board of directors the board to ensure that financial instruments are appropriately priced at fair value in accordance with gaap and the  act subject to oversight by the board the valuation committee develops and oversees pricingrelated policies and procedures and approves all fair value determinations specifically the valuation committee establishes procedures to value securities determines pricing techniques sources and persons eligible to effect fair value pricing actions oversees the selection services and performance of pricing vendors oversees valuationrelated business continuity practices and provides guidance on internal controls and valuationrelated matters the valuation committee reports to the board and has representation from legal portfolio management and trading operations risk management and the funds treasurer various valuation techniques and inputs are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments gaap establishes the following fair value hierarchy that categorizes the inputs used to measure fair value level   quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical financial instruments that the fund can access at the reporting date level   inputs other than level  quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly including but not limited to quoted prices for similar financial instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar financial instruments in inactive markets interest rates and yield curves implied volatilities and credit spreads level   unobservable inputs observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information about actual events or transactions and reflect the assumptions that market participants would use to price the financial instrument unobservable inputs are those for which market data are not available and are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use to price the financial instrument gaap requires valuation techniques to maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when multiple inputs are used to derive fair value the financial instrument is assigned to the level within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowestlevel input that is significant to the fair value of the financial instrument input levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk or liquidity associated with financial instruments at that level but rather the degree of judgment used in determining those values valuation techniques debt securities generally are traded in the overthecounter otc market securities with remaining maturities of one year or more at the time of acquisition are valued at prices furnished by dealers who make markets in such securities or by an independent pricing service which considers the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality coupon maturity and type as well as prices quoted by dealers who make markets in such securities securities with remaining maturities of less than one year at the time of acquisition generally use amortized cost in local currency to approximate fair value however if amortized cost is deemed not to reflect fair value or the fund holds a significant amount of such securities with remaining maturities of more than  days the securities are valued at prices furnished by dealers who make markets in such securities or by an independent pricing service generally debt securities are categorized in level  of the fair value hierarchy however to the extent the valuations include significant unobservable inputs the securities would be categorized in level  investments in mutual funds are valued at the mutual funds closing nav per share on the day of valuation and are categorized in level  of the fair value hierarchy assets and liabilities other than financial instruments including shortterm receivables and payables are carried at cost or estimated realizable value if less which approximates fair value thinly traded financial instruments and those for which the above valuation procedures are inappropriate or are deemed not to reflect fair value are stated at fair value as determined in good faith by the valuation committee the objective of any fair value pricing determination is to arrive at a price that could reasonably be expected from a current sale financial instruments fair valued by the valuation committee are primarily private placements restricted securities warrants rights and other securities that are not publicly traded subject to oversight by the board the valuation committee regularly makes good faith judgments to establish and adjust the fair valuations of certain securities as events occur and circumstances warrant for instance in determining the fair value of troubled or thinly traded debt instruments the valuation committee considers a variety of factors which may include but are not limited to the issuers business prospects its financial standing and performance recent investment transactions in the issuer strategic events affecting the company market liquidity for the issuer and general economic conditions and events in consultation with the investment and pricing teams the valuation committee will determine an appropriate valuation technique based on available information which may include both observable and unobservable inputs the valuation committee typically will afford greatest weight to actual prices in arms length transactions to the extent they represent orderly transactions between market participants transaction information can be reliably obtained and prices are deemed representative of fair value however the valuation committee may also consider other valuation methods such as a discount or premium from market value of a similar freely traded security of the same issuer discounted cash flows yield to maturity or some combination fair value determinations are reviewed on a regular basis and updated as information becomes available including actual purchase and sale transactions of the issue because any fair value determination involves a significant amount of judgment there is a degree of subjectivity inherent in such pricing decisions and fair value prices determined by the valuation committee could differ from those of other market participants depending on the relative significance of unobservable inputs including the valuation techniques used fair valued securities may be categorized in level  or  of the fair value hierarchy valuation inputs the following table summarizes the funds financial instruments based on the inputs used to determine their fair values on april   there were no

funds board of directors board including a majority of the funds independent directors approved the continuation of the investment management agreement advisory contract between the fund and its investment advisor t rowe price associates inc advisor in connection with its deliberations the board requested and the advisor provided such information as the board with advice from independent legal counsel deemed reasonably necessary the board considered a variety of factors in connection with its review of the advisory contract also taking into account information provided by the advisor during the course of the year as discussed below services provided by the advisor the board considered the nature quality and extent of the services provided to the fund by the advisor these services included but were not limited to directing the funds investments in accordance with its investment program and the overall management of the funds portfolio as well as a variety of related activities such as financial investment operations and administrative services compliance maintaining the funds records and registrations and shareholder communications the board also reviewed the background and experience of the advisors senior management team and investment personnel involved in the management of the fund as well as the advisors compliance record the board concluded that it was satisfied with the nature quality and extent of the services provided by the advisor investment performance of the fund the board reviewed the funds threemonth oneyear and yearbyyear returns as well as the funds average annualized total returns over the   and year periods and compared these returns with a wide variety of previously agreedupon comparable performance measures and market data including those supplied by lipper and morningstar which are independent providers of mutual fund data on the basis of this evaluation and the boards ongoing review of investment results and factoring in the relative market conditions during certain of the performance periods the board concluded that the funds performance was satisfactory costs benefits profits and economies of scale the board reviewed detailed information regarding the revenues received by the advisor under the advisory contract and other benefits that the advisor and its affiliates may have realized from its relationship with the fund including any research received under soft dollar agreements and commissionsharing arrangements with brokerdealers the board considered that the advisor may receive some benefit from softdollar arrangements pursuant to which research is received from brokerdealers that execute the applicable funds portfolio transactions the board received information on the estimated costs incurred and profits realized by the advisor from managing t rowe price mutual funds the board also reviewed estimates of the profits realized from managing the fund in particular and the board concluded that the advisors profits were reasonable in light of the services provided to the fund the board also considered whether the fund benefits under the fee levels set forth in the advisory contract from any economies of scale realized by the advisor the board noted that under the advisory contract the fund pays the advisor a single fee or allinclusive management fee which is based on the funds average daily net assets the allinclusive management fee includes investment management services and provides for the advisor to pay all of the funds ordinary recurring operating expenses except for interest taxes portfolio transaction fees and any nonrecurring extraordinary expenses that may arise the board concluded that based on the profitability data it reviewed and consistent with this allinclusive management fee structure the advisory contract provided for a reasonable sharing of any benefits from economies of scale with the fund fees the board was provided with information regarding industry trends in management fees and expenses and the board reviewed the funds management fee rate and total expense ratio in comparison with fees and expenses of other comparable funds based on information and data supplied by lipper for these purposes the board assumed that the funds management fee rate was equal to the allinclusive management fee rate less the funds actual operating expenses and the total expense ratio was equal to the allinclusive management fee rate the information provided to the board indicated that the funds management fee rate was at or below the median for comparable funds and the funds total expense ratio was above the median for comparable funds the board also reviewed the fee schedules for institutional accounts and private accounts with similar mandates that are advised or subadvised by the advisor and its affiliates management provided the board with information about the advisors responsibilities and services provided to subadvisory and other institutional account clients including information about how the requirements and economics of the institutional business are fundamentally different from those of the mutual fund business the board considered information showing that the advisors mutual fund business is generally more complex from a business and compliance perspective than its institutional account business and considered various relevant factors such as the broader scope of operations and oversight more extensive shareholder communication infrastructure greater asset flows heightened business risks and differences in applicable laws and regulations associated with the advisors proprietary mutual fund business in assessing the reasonableness of the funds management fee rate the board considered the differences in the nature of the services required for the advisor to manage its mutual fund business versus managing a discrete pool of assets as a subadvisor to another institutions mutual fund or for an institutional account and that the advisor generally performs significant additional services and assumes greater risk in managing the fund and other t rowe price mutual funds than it does for institutional account clients on the basis of the information provided and the factors considered the board concluded that the fees paid by the fund under the advisory contract are reasonable approval of the advisory contract as noted the board approved the continuation of the advisory contract no single factor was considered in isolation or to be determinative to the decision rather the board concluded in light of a weighting and balancing of all factors considered that it was in the best interests of the fund and its shareholders for the board to approve the continuation of the advisory contract including the fees to be charged for services thereunder the independent directors were advised throughout the process by independent legal counsel item  code of ethics a code
