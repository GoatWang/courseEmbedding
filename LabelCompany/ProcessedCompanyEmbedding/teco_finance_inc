company a regulated vertically integrated electric utility rating action moodys downgrades teco energy and tampa electric companys ratings upon emera acquisition close global credit research   jul  over  billion of rated debt affected new york july    moodys investors service moodys downgraded the senior unsecured ratings of teco energy inc teco and its financing subsidiary teco finance inc to baa from baa and the issuer and senior unsecured ratings of tampa electric company tec to a from a these rating actions conclude the review for downgrade that commenced on june   as a result of emera incs emera baa stable acquisition of teco emeras acquisition of teco closed on july   the rating outlooks for teco teco finance and tec are stable tecos downgrade is primarily driven by the significant incremental debt issued across the emera parent holding companies said jeff cassella vice president  senior analyst the downgrade also factors in the lack of any meaningful ringfence type provisions designed to insulate teco energy or its principal utility subsidiary tampa electric company ratings rationale tecos baa senior unsecured rating is primarily driven by the solid credit quality of its principal subsidiary tec which operates under floridas highly supportive regulatory framework the rating also reflects tecos solid financial metrics and incorporates the modest cash flow and regulatory diversity provided by new mexico gas company not rated tecos rating is heavily influenced by tecs rating but also reflects the roughly  ratio of tecos holding company debt issued at teco finance as a percentage of the teco family consolidated debt teco finances debt is guaranteed by teco therefore teco finance has the same rating furthermore emeras holding company debt which includes the effects of tecos consolidated debt produces a ratio of holding company debt to total consolidated debt approaching  this capital structure leads to material structural subordination and wider rating notch differential even though the holding company is supported by a diversified group of operating subsidiaries for calculation purposes moodys includes the debt at teco finance as holding company debt and includes the maritime link project debt financing in emeras total consolidated debt tampa electric companys a senior unsecured rating reflects floridas highly supportive regulatory framework which allows a suite of timely cost recovery mechanisms these mechanisms provide more stable and consistent cash flows which enable the utility to generate strong financial metrics tecs rating incorporates a view that the utility will earn close to its allowed roes of about  and maintain its ratio of cfo prewc to debt in the midtohigh  range tecs rating is constrained by the significant amount of debt held at its parent company teco as well as its ultimate parent emera rating outlook teco and tecs stable rating outlooks reflect our expectation that the florida regulatory jurisdiction remains supportive and provide timely recovery mechanisms for prudently incurred costs and investments the stable outlook also incorporates our view that teco and tecs financial metrics will remain strong including tecos cfo prewc to debt in the midtohigh teens and tecs cfo prewc to debt in the midtohigh  range the stable outlook also assumes that teco or emera will not materially increase their intermediate holding company or parent level debt further that could cause downwards rating pressure across the entire corporate family factors that could lead to an upgrade tecos rating could be upgraded if tecs rating was upgraded in addition tecos rating could be upgraded if the debt levels at teco and emera were significantly reduced to where holding company debt was below  of consolidated debt on a sustained basis furthermore the regulatory jurisdictions where tecos utility subsidiaries operate need to remain credit supportive particularly tecs regulatory environment in florida and tecos ratio of cfo prewc to debt was sustained in the high teens range tecs rating could be upgraded if the debt levels at teco and emera were significantly reduced to where holding company debt was below  of consolidated debt on a sustained basis in addition to a reduction in holding company debt the florida regulatory environment needs to remain credit supportive and tecs financial metrics were to remain strong including cfo prewc to debt in the high  range on a sustained basis factors that could lead to a downgrade tecos rating could be downgraded if tecs rating was downgraded in addition a rating downgrade could occur if the company were to substantially increase its level of parent debt relative to consolidated debt or if it were to invest in other noncore unregulated business the rating would also experience downward pressure if there was a sustained deterioration in financial metrics such as its ratio of cfo prewc to debt were to decline below  on a sustained basis furthermore teco and its subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded if its ultimate parent emera were to increase its parent level debt or grow its nonregulated businesses such that the teco family experiences further contagion risk tecs rating could be downgraded if floridas regulatory framework becomes less supportive such that regulatory lag increases or tecs ability to recover its costs in a timely manner is negatively affected separately tecs ratings could be negatively affected if contagion risk exposure to its new parent emera or its affiliated businesses increases due to incremental leverage or additional unregulated business investments in addition a downgrade could occur if its financial metrics weakened such that cfo prewc to debt were to decline to the low  range on a sustained basis teco energy inc is an intermediate holding company whose principal subsidiary is tampa electric company a regulated electric and gas utility in florida which composed  of tecos operating earnings from continued operations in  tecs electric business tampa electric provides retail electric service to over  customers in west central florida while tecs gas business peoples gas system serves over  customers in floridas major metropolitan areas teco also owns new mexico gas company a natural gas local distribution company serving  primarily residential customers in new mexico which approximates  of the states total population teco guarantees the approximately  billion of debt issued by its rated financing subsidiary arm teco finance inc tec and pgs are regulated by the florida public service commission while nmgc is regulated by the new mexico public regulation commission on july   teco energy and its subsidiaries were acquired by emera inc for

global credit research   jun  approximately  billion of debt affected new york june    moodys investors service moodys assigned a new baa issuer rating to emera inc emera and a baa senior unsecured rating to emera us finance lps new note issuance of up to  billion moodys also assigned a ba rating to emeras unsecured subordinated notes of up to  billion due  the rating outlooks of emera and emera us finance are stable at the same time moodys placed the longterm ratings of teco energy and its subsidiaries on review for downgrade including the baa senior unsecured ratings of teco energy the baa senior unsecured rating of teco energys financing subsidiary teco finance inc and the a issuer and senior unsecured ratings of tampa electric company emera us finance is a financing subsidiary of emera and its senior unsecured notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by emera and emera us holdings inc eushi unrated an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of emera as a result of the guarantee emera us finances rating is directly correlated to emeras credit profile and rating eushi does not have any operations and serves as the holding company of emeras assets located in the united states including emera maine and teco energy inc upon acquisition close ratings rationale emeras baa rating assumes the teco energy acquisition will close imminently and reflects the companys diverse and largely regulated business risk profile offset by very high consolidated leverage said jeff cassella vice president  senior analyst concurrently teco and its subsidiaries review for downgrade is prompted by emeras significant use of debt to finance the acquisition and the lack of meaningful ringfence type provisions designed to insulate tecos credit profile the review for downgrade at teco energy is likely to result in no more than a onenotch downgrade of teco energy and its subsidiaries ratings on or about the time of the acquisition close a onenotch downgrade across the teco family will not have any material impact on emeras newly assigned baa rating because emeras baa rating already incorporates the view of teco energys weakened credit profile the review will focus on the amount of incremental debt issued at the emera parent level to finance the acquisition the increased strategic importance of teco energy particularly its principal operating subsidiary tampa electric company to service the increased level of debt via upstream dividend payments within the emera corporate family and the lack of any meaningful ringfence type provisions designed to insulate teco energy or tampa electric companys credit profile from debt at its intermediate parent or that of emera emeras baa rating reflects emeras lower risk business profile that includes good geographic and regulatory diversity across its portfolio of operating subsidiaries emeras regulated subsidiaries are expected to account for approximately  of consolidated cash flows a credit positive however emera will be exposed to a high financial risk profile evidenced by the significant level of consolidated debt including debt to rate base of over  these debt levels are a direct result of emeras leveraged acquisition of teco energy and we expect the leverage to weigh on emeras proforma consolidated financial metrics over the next several years that said emeras baa rating incorporates a view that emeras financial profile will improve over the next few years such that emeras proforma ratio of cash flow from operations preworking capital cfo prewc to debt will steadily improve to the midteens range from around  in  furthermore emeras holding company debt as a percentage of total consolidated debt approaches  which leads to material structural subordination considerations and points to a wider ratingnotch differential between the ratings of emera and its principal operating subsidiaries for calculation purposes we include the debt at teco energys intermediate holding company as well as a proportion of the maritime link project debt as holding company debt in the calculation of holding company debt to total consolidated debt the ba rating assigned to the subordinated hybrid notes is two notches below emeras baa senior unsecured rating as they are subordinated to substantially all of the companys other debt obligations the notes have a longdated maturity  years and emera can opt to defer coupons on a cumulative basis for up to five years for further details please refer to moodys cross sector rating methodology hybrid equity credit march  rating outlook emeras stable rating outlook incorporates a view that emera will successfully execute on its permanent financing plans to finance the teco energy acquisition in a consistent manner with what has been stated publicly the stable outlook also reflects our expectation that emeras consolidated financial metrics improve such that consolidated cfo prewc to debt approaches  over the next  years that the regulatory jurisdictions that emeras operating subsidiaries operate continue to remain credit supportive by providing timely recovery of prudently incurred costs and investments that the construction and execution risks associated with the large martime link project will remain manageable and will avoid material delays and cost overruns and that emera will not undertake aggressive shareholder friendly debt financed activities that will be a detriment to the risk profile of the corporate family factors that could lead to an upgrade given the significant amount of holding company debt at the emera level a rating upgrade in the neartointermediate term is unlikely however a rating upgrade could occur of holding company debt as a percentage of consolidated debt were to decline below  on a sustained basis and if consolidated metrics improved such that cfo prewc to debt was sustained at or above the  level factors that could lead to a downgrade emeras rating could be downgraded if regulatory support of its operating utilities deteriorates or business risk profile increases through investments in its nonregulated activities or holding company debt increases further or if financial metrics do not improve as expected and consolidated cfo prewc to debt remains below  on a sustained basis headquartered in halifax nova scotia emera is a diversified utility and energy services holding company with approximately  billion in assets and  billion in revenues in  upon closing of the teco energy acquisition emera will own regulated electric gas and transmission and distribution utilities in nova scotia maine florida new mexico and the caribbean islands the company also owns other regulated and nonregulated electric and gas assets in north america proforma for the teco energy acquisition approximately  of the companys earnings will be generated by rateregulated businesses and emera will have more than  billion in
