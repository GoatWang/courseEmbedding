and ceo amazoncom i knew that if i failed i would regret that but i knew the one thing i might regret is not trying king of cybercommerce date of birth january   jeffrey p bezos was born in albuquerque new mexico his mother was still in her teens and her marriage to his father lasted little more than a year she remarried when jeffrey was four jeffrey’s stepfather mike bezos was born in cuba he escaped to the united states alone at age  and worked his way through the university of albuquerque when he married jeffrey’s mother the family moved to houston where mike bezos became an engineer for exxon jeffrey’s maternal ancestors were early settlers in texas and over the generations had acquired a acre ranch at cotulla jeffrey’s grandfather was a regional director of the atomic energy commission in albuquerque he retired early to the family ranch where jeffrey spent most of the summers of his youth working with his grandfather at the enormously varied tasks essential to the operation jeff bezos small but already thinking bigfrom an early age jeffrey displayed a striking mechanical aptitude even as a toddler he asserted himself by dismantling his crib with a screwdriver he also developed intense and varied scientific interests rigging an electric alarm to keep his younger siblings out of his room and converting his parents’ garage into a laboratory for his science projects when he was a teenager the family moved to miami florida in high school in miami jeffrey first fell in love with computers an outstanding student he was valedictorian of his class he entered princeton university planning to study physics but soon returned to his love of computers and graduated with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering after graduation jeff bezos found employment on wall street where computer science was increasingly in demand to study market trends he went to work at fitel a startup company that was building a network to conduct international trade he stayed in the finance realm with bankers trust rising to a vice presidency at d e shaw a firm specializing in the application of computer science to the stock market bezos was hired as much for his overall talent as for any particular assignment while working at shaw jeff met his wife mackenzie also a princeton graduate he rose quickly at shaw becoming a senior vice president and looked forward to a bright career in finance when he made a discovery that changed his life — and the course of business history jeff bezos age  with his grandfather lawrence preston gise on the family ranch at cotulla texas in the internet was originally created by the defense department to keep its computer networks connected during an emergency such as natural catastrophe or enemy attack over the years it was adopted by government and academic researchers to exchange data and messages but as late as  there was still no internet commerce to speak of one day that spring jeffrey bezos observed that internet usage was increasing by  percent a year he saw an opportunity for a new sphere of business and immediately began considering the possibilities in typically methodical fashion bezos reviewed the top  mail order businesses and asked himself which could be conducted more efficiently over the internet than by traditional means books were the commodity for which no comprehensive mail order catalogue existed because any such catalogue would be too big to mail — perfect for the internet which could share a vast database with a virtually limitless number of people he flew to los angeles the very next day to attend the american booksellers’ convention and learn everything he could about the book business he found that the major book wholesalers had already compiled electronic lists of their inventory all that was needed was a single location on the internet where the bookbuying public could search the available stock and place orders directly bezos’s employers weren’t prepared to proceed with such a venture and bezos knew the only way to seize the opportunity was to go into business for himself it would mean sacrificing a secure position in new york but he and his wife mackenzie decided to make the leap jeff bezos king of cybercommerce and founder of the world’s largest online shopping retailer amazoncomjeff and mackenzie flew to texas on independence day weekend and picked up a  chevy blazer a gift from mike bezos to make the drive to seattle where they would have ready access to the book wholesaler ingram and to the pool of computer talent jeff would need for his enterprise mackenzie drove while jeff typed a business plan the company would be called amazon for the seemingly endless south american river with its numberless branches they set up shop in a twobedroom house with extension cords running to the garage jeff set up three sun microstations on tables he’d made out of doors from home depot for less than  each when the test site was up and running jeff asked  friends and acquaintances to test it the code worked seamlessly across different computer platforms on july   bezos opened his site to the world and told his  beta testers to spread the word in  days with no press amazon had sold books in all  states and  foreign countries by september it had sales of  a week bezos and his team continued improving the site introducing such unheardof features as oneclick shopping customer reviews and email order verification jeff bezos was time magazine’s choice as person of the year in  gregory heislertime incgetty images the business grew faster than bezos or anyone else had ever imagined when the company went public in  skeptics wondered if an internetbased startup bookseller could maintain its position once traditional retail heavyweights like barnes and noble or borders entered the internet picture two years later the market value of shares in amazon was greater than that of its two biggest retail competitors combined and borders was striking a deal for amazon to handle its internet traffic jeff had told his original investors there was a  percent chance they would lose their entire investment but his parents signed on for  a substantial portion of their life savings “we weren’t betting on the internet” his mother has said “we were betting on jeff” by the end of the decade as six per cent owners of amazon they were billionaires for several years as much as a third of the shares in the company were held by members of the bezos family from the beginning bezos sought to increase market share as quickly as possible at the expense of profits when he disclosed his intention to go from being “earth’s biggest bookstore” to “earth’s biggest anything store” skeptics thought amazon was growing too big too fast but a few analysts called it “one of the smartest strategies in business history” through each round of expansion jeff bezos continually emphasized the “six core values customer obsession ownership bias for action frugality high hiring bar and innovation” “our vision” he said “is the world’s most customercentric company the place where people come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online” amazon moved into music cds videos toys electronics and more when the internet’s stock market bubble burst amazon restructured and while other dotcom startups evaporated amazon was posting profits jeff bezos addresses the student delegates at the  academy of achievement summit in san antonio texasin october  the firm added clothing sales to its lineup through partnerships with hundreds of retailers including the gap nordstrom and land’s end amazon shares its expertise in customer service and online order fulfillment with other vendors through cobranded sites such as those with

microsoft founder bill gates bezos and his wife mackenzie continue to live in the seattle area and are increasingly concerned with philanthropic activities “giving away money takes as much attention as building a successful company” jeff bezos has said inducted in  career entrepreneur date of birth january   “i’m going to go do this crazy thing i’m going to start this company selling books online” in  jeff bezos was a yearold vice president of a new york investment firm newly married with a secure and prosperous future ahead of him he decided to give it all up and drive to seattle with his wife in a used car to start a business in their garage he was betting his own savings — and his parents’ and friends’ — on a totally untried notion that people would buy books through a littleknown network of computers called the internet jeff bezos was convinced that this global network primarily the domain of academics and government scientists could become a vibrant new venue for commerce with the right product and the right plan almost overnight the company bezos started amazoncom changed the bookbuying habits of a nation bezos and his investors found their shares in the company worth billions as the company’s capitalization soared bezos embarked on a risky strategy of expansion forgoing immediate profits to secure an everlarger share of the internet market not only in books but in music videos electronics toys and clothing at the turn of the st century the internet bubble burst and fortunes seemingly made overnight literally vanished yet amazon flowed on like its mighty namesake still expanding but also showing profits while other promising startups faded from the scene oncedaunting competitors had become grateful partners the vision of jeff bezos had prevailed and the world of commerce had changed forever watch full interview king of cybercommerce san antonio texas may   when did you get the idea to start amazon was there a moment of inspiration jeff bezos the wakeup call was finding this startling statistic that web usage in the spring of  was growing at  percent a year you know things just don’t grow that fast  it’s highly unusual and that started me about thinking “what kind of business plan might make sense in the context of that growth” you couldn’t have been the only one to see that growth statistic jeff bezos no in fact not only was i not the only one but a lot of people saw it much earlier technology entrepreneur jeff bezos holds his first new york city news conference in  najlah feannycorbisnot everyone has been able to realize that potential the way you have what do you think enabled you to see what you saw and to act on it jeff bezos i think there are a couple of things one of the things everybody should realize is that any time a startup company turns into a substantial company over the years there was a lot of luck involved there are a lot of entrepreneurs there are a lot of people who are very smart very hardworking very few ever have the planetary alignment that leads to a tiny little company growing into something substantial so that requires not only a lot of planning a lot of hard work a big team of people who are all dedicated but it also requires that not only the planets align but that you get a few galaxies in there aligning too that’s certainly what happened to us keys to success — preparation our timing was good our choice of product categories — books — was a very good choice and we did a lot of analysis on that to pick that category as the first best category for ecommerce online but there were no guarantees that that was a good category at the time we launched this business it wasn’t even crystal clear that the technology would improve fast enough that ordinary people — noncomputer people — would even want to bother with this technology so that was good luck so there are a whole bunch of things that have to sort of align to make it work here you were sitting in new york city in a very good job a lucrative position with a future you go home and you say to your wife you want to throw all that over and get in the car and go to seattle what possessed you to do that what was her reaction what is the role of risk taking keys to success — courage jeff bezos i went to my boss and said to him “you know i’m going to go do this crazy thing and i’m going to start this company selling books online” this was something that i had already been talking to him about in a sort of more general context but then he said “let’s go on a walk” and we went on a twohour walk in central park in new york city and the conclusion of that was this he said “you know this actually sounds like a really good idea to me but it sounds like it would be a better idea for somebody who didn’t already have a good job” he convinced me to think about it for  hours before making a final decision so i went away and was trying to find the right framework in which to make that kind of big decision i had already talked to my wife about this and she was very supportive and said “look you know you can count me in  percent whatever you want to do” it’s true she had married this fairly stable guy in a stable career path and now he wanted to go do this crazy thing but she was  percent supportive so it really was a decision that i had to make for myself and the framework i found which made the decision incredibly easy was what i called — which only a nerd would call — a “regret minimization framework” so i wanted to project myself forward to age  and say “okay now i’m looking back on my life i want to have minimized the number of regrets i have” i knew that when i was  i was not going to regret having tried this i was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the internet that i thought was going to be a really big deal i knew that if i failed i wouldn’t regret that but i knew the one thing i might regret is not ever having tried i knew that that would haunt me every day and so when i thought about it that way it was an incredibly easy decision and i think that’s very good if you can project yourself out to age  and sort of think “what will i think at that time” it gets you away from some of the daily pieces of confusion you know i left this wall street firm in the middle of the year when you do that you walk away from your annual bonus that’s the kind of thing that in the shortterm can confuse you but if you think about the longterm then you can really make good life decisions that you won’t regret later most regrets by the way are acts of omission and not commission if you do bad things if you go murder somebody that would be bad and that would be an act of commission that you would regret but most everyday ordinary nonmurderers when they’re  years old their big regrets are omissions when you showed up in seattle you had left your job you’d left any regrets you might have behind you how do you get something like amazoncom started what did you have to do jeff bezos that blank sheet of paper stage is one of the hardest stages and one of the reasons it’s hard is because at that stage there’s nobody counting on you but yourself today it’s easy because we’ve got millions of customers counting on us and thousands of investors counting on us and thousands of employees all counting on each other in that beginning stage it’s really just you and you can quit any time nobody is going to care so you set about doing the simple things first keys to success — preparation so you want to start a company  well the first thing you do is you should write a business plan and so i did that  i wrote about a page business plan  i wrote a first draft  in fact i wrote the first draft on the car trip from the east coast to the west coast  and that is very helpful you know the business plan won’t survive its first encounters with reality it will always be different the reality will never be the plan but the discipline of writing the plan forces you to think through some of the issues and to get sort of mentally comfortable in the space then you start to understand if you push on this knob this will move over here and so on  so that’s the first step jeff bezos ceo of amazoncom at home in seattle washington  the company began as an internet merchant of books and quickly expanded to a wide variety of products and services  moskowitzcorbiswe tried to get a lot of the little housekeeping details done even before we arrived in seattle i called a friend who lived in seattle and asked if he could recommend an attorney he recommended his divorce lawyer but that’s who we used it was a general practitioner a sort of small sole practitioner he incorporated the company he asked me on the cell phone what name would you like the company incorporated under i said “cadabra as in abra cadabra” and he said “cadaver” i knew then that was not going to be a good name we went ahead and incorporated under that name we changed it about three months later i stopped in san francisco and interviewed vice presidents of engineering because that was going to be an important long lead time item we needed to build the technology that would run the store and found the person who turned out to be the most important person ever in the history of amazoncom on that trip a guy named shel kaphan who built all of our early systems he had help from others but he was the architect he engineered them and just did a fantastic job so writing the business plan the initial hiring getting the company incorporated all these are simple almost pedestrian tasks but that’s how you start one step at a time were investors knocking at your door jeff bezos oh no keys to success — courage the first initial startup capital for amazoncom came primarily from my parents and they invested a large fraction of their life savings in what became amazoncom  and you know that was a very bold and trusting thing for them to do because they didn’t know my dad’s first question was “what’s the internet” okay  so he wasn’t making a bet on this company or this concept  he was making a bet on his son as was my mother so i told them that i thought there was a  percent chance that they would lose their whole investment which was a few hundred thousand dollars and they did it anyway  and you know i thought i was giving myself triple the normal odds because  really if you look at the odds of a startup company succeeding at all it’s only about ten percent  here i was giving myself a  percent chance there are so many things that can go wrong when we launched that store in july of  we were shocked at the customer response literally in the first  days we had orders from all  states and  different countries and we were woefully unprepared from an operational point of view to handle that kind of volume in fact we quickly expanded we talked to our landlord and we expanded into a squarefoot basement warehouse space that had sixfoot ceilings one of our ten employees was sixtwo he went around like this the whole time we were doing our day jobs which might have been computer programming — all the different things that ten people will do in a tiny startup company and then we would spend all afternoon into the wee hours of the morning packing up the orders and shipping them out i would drive these things to ups so we could get the last one and we would wait till the last second i’d get to ups and i would sort of bang on the glass door that was closed they would always take pity on me and sort of open up and let us ship things late we had so many orders that we weren’t ready for that we had no real organization in our distribution center at all in fact we were packing on our hands and knees on a hard concrete floor i remember just to show you how stupid i can be — my only defense is that it was late we were packing these things everybody in the company and i had this brainstorm as i said to the person next to me “this packing is killing me my back hurts this is killing my knees on this hard cement floor” and this person said “yeah i know what you mean” and i said “you know what we need” my brilliant insight “we need knee pads” i was very serious and this person looked at me like i was the stupidest person they’d ever seen i’m working for this person this is great “what we need is packing tables” i looked at this person and i thought that was the smartest idea i had ever heard  the next day we got packing tables and i think we doubled our productivity  that early stage by the way of amazoncom when we were so unprepared is probably one of the luckiest things that ever happened to us because it formed a culture of customer service in every department of the company  every single person in the company because we had to work with our hands so close to the customers making sure those orders went out really set up a culture that served us well and that is our goal to be earth’s most customercentric company  in a second round of fundraising about a year later or so we raised a million dollars and i had to talk to about  different people  these were angel investors venture capitalists were totally uninterested it wasn’t like what people think of today keys to success — perseverance in  and  you could raise  million for an internet idea without a business plan with a single phone call  it was a very different era but back in  it was very difficult to raise money and by the way it wasn’t more difficult than it had been for the previous  years to raise money it just was sort of normally hard it’s supposed to be hard to raise a million dollars so with a lot of hard work we raised that million dollars from about  different angel investors who invested about  each and that was the original money that really funded amazoncom did you ever have any selfdoubts fear of failure jeff bezos in a strange way no because remember… keys to success — perseverance once you are looking at the odds in a realistic way — it’s very important for entrepreneurs to be realistic — and so if you believe on that first day while you’re writing the business plan that there’s a  percent chance that the whole thing will fail then that kind of relieves the pressure of selfdoubt it’s sort of like i don’t have any doubt about whether we’re going to fail that’s the likely outcome it just is and to pretend that it’s not will lead you to do strange and unnatural things so what you do with those early investment dollars — if you have  and then you have a million dollars — what you do with those early precious capital resources is you go about systematically trying to eliminate risk so you pick whatever you think the biggest problems are and you try to eliminate them one at a time that’s how small companies get a little bit bigger and then a little bit bigger and a little bit bigger until finally at a certain stage you reach a transition where the company has more control over its future destiny when a company is very tiny it needs a tremendous amount of not only hard work but as we talked about earlier luck  as a company gets bigger it starts to become a little more stable at a certain point in time the company has a much bigger influence over its future outcome and it needs a lot less luck and instead it needs the hard work  at that point there’s a little bit more pressure because if you fail you have nobody to blame but yourself we understand you were born in albuquerque did you grow up there jeff bezos no i left albuquerque when i was about four we moved to houston texas what was it like for you growing up jeff bezos well i had what i considered to be an idyllic childhood i mean i had two parents who loved me incredibly i also had a tremendous amount of contact with my grandparents — my mom’s parents in fact i spent all my summers on my grandfather’s ranch not far from where we’re sitting right now not far from san antonio and i spent three months every year from the age of four to the age of  working on the ranch with my grandfather which was just an incredible incredible experience ranchers — and anybody i think who works in rural areas — they learn how to be very selfreliant and whether they’re farmers whatever it is they’re doing they have to rely on themselves for a lot of things my grandfather did sort of all of his own veterinary care on the cattle we would you know repair the d caterpillar bulldozer when it broke and it had gears this big you know we would build cranes to lift the gears out this is just a very common sort of thing that folks in far away places do i think it was a great experience how come you didn’t grow up to be a cowboy jeff bezos there’s a little bit of that in me i think i remember the very first occupation i wanted to be — when i think i was about six years old — was an archeologist i would like to point out this was before indiana jones it’s a point of pride then i wanted to be an astronaut by the time i was in my high school years i wanted to be a physicist and then by the time i got to college i wanted to be a computer programmer that’s actually what i studied in school and that’s what has led me along the path i’m on did you have heroes or role models when you were growing up jeff bezos i did i had some family role models certainly my grandfather was a serious role model for me i think you learn different things from grandparents than you learn from parents it’s great i would encourage anybody to try to spend time not only with their parents but with their grandparents i had some historical role models that i looked at too two people i always would read about were thomas edison and walt disney those were sort of my two biographical heroes why edison and disney jeff bezos i’ve always been interested in inventors and invention edison of course for a little kid and probably for adults too is not only the symbol of that but the actual fact of that — the incredible inventor i’ve always felt that there’s a certain kind of important pioneering that goes on from an inventor like thomas edison disney was a different sort of thing he was also a real pioneer and an inventor doing new things it seemed to me that he had this incredible capability to create a vision that he could get a large number of people to share things that disney invented like disneyland the theme parks they were such big visions that no single individual could ever pull them off unlike a lot of the things that edison worked on walt disney really was able to get a big team of people working in a concerted direction what kind of a student were you as a kid jeff bezos i was a very nerdy and good student i was in the “goody goody” class of students and was working hard studying i always did my homework on time i was a good student i liked school did you ever get into trouble jeff bezos very rarely the things i got into trouble on were like i lost my library privileges one time — which was really inconvenient for me — for laughing too loudly in the library i’ve had this laugh all my life i have no idea where it came from there was a period where my brother and sister wouldn’t go see a movie with me it was too embarrassing i was probably unnaturally on the side of not getting in trouble by the time i was in high school we did some prank type things but they were the kind of pranks that at the end of the day the teachers actually secretly loved are there any books you remember being important to you when you were growing up jeff bezos at different ages lots of different books i remember in fourth grade we had this wonderful contest which was — the people in the class whoever — there was some prize — i can’t even remember what it was — whoever could read the most newbery award winners in a year and i read through — i didn’t end up winning you know i think i read like  newbery award winners that year but somebody else read more the standout there is the old classic that i think so many people have read and enjoyed a wrinkle in time and i just remember loving that book i was always a big fan of science fiction even from when i was you know in elementary school reading various things and loved of course the hobbit and tolkien’s trilogy that follows on from that in this little town where my grandfather lived — in the summers where i spent my time in the summer — had a tiny little andrew carnegiestyle library where all the books had been donated from the local citizens and i found —i mean this was a very small library smaller than the room that we’re sitting in now — but it had an extensive science fiction collection because it just so happened one of the residents of this person town had been a science fiction fan and donated their whole collection and that started a love affair for me with people like heinlein and asimov and all the wellknown science fiction authors that persists to this day what about teachers were there any teachers you remember that had an influence on you jeff bezos oh tons of teachers my math teacher in fourth or fifth grade mrs mcinerney she had a big influence on me my calculus teacher in high school mr bohr he had a big influence on me ms del champs who taught chemistry in high school ms ruehl who taught physics i really have been blessed with conscientious hardworking super smart teachers i only got to go through school once so i don’t know but i have a feeling i was lucky i know there are a lot of hardworking teachers out there but i seem to have had more than my fair share is it possible to say what these teachers did for you jeff bezos i always wanted to please teachers who are really good create that environment where you can be very satisfied by the process of learning if you do something and you find it a very satisfying experience then you want to do more of it the great teachers somehow convey in their very attitude and their words and their actions and everything they do that this is an important thing you’re learning you end up wanting to do more of it and more of it and more of it that’s a real talent some people have to convey the importance of that and to reflect it back to the students when you weren’t studying what kinds of things did you like to do jeff bezos i was very difficult to punish for my parents because they would send me to my room and i was always happy to go to my room because i would just read “you’re grounded and you have to stay in your room” that was always fine with me i was a big reader i remember playing lots of games in elementary school like kickthecan tag all the outdoor games i did all those things i had a very normal childhood — except for my ranch experience which i think is a very unusual experience and a great one to have had — i think my experience as a kid was a very normal one how did you get along with your siblings jeff bezos pretty well i was five and six years older than them now that i’m  years old it’s like we’re the same generation when i was  and they were  and  i had no time for them whatsoever they were the pesky younger siblings that i was trying to shake off and keep out of my room we’ve read about your inventiveness as a kid with your radio shack electronics kit and an alarm that you set up in your room jeff bezos i was constantly boobytrapping the house with various kinds of alarms and some of them were not just audible sounds but actually like physical boobytraps i think i occasionally worried my parents that they were going to open the door one day and have  pounds of nails drop on their head or something our garage was basically science fair central and my mom is a saint because she would drive me to radio shack multiple times a day to the point where she would finally say “okay look will you please get your parts list straight before we go i can’t handle more than one trip to radio shack per day” so there was a lot of that kind of stuff going on in our house all of this eventually led you to princeton jeff bezos yeah so i went to princeton primarily because i wanted to study physics and it’s such a fantastic place to study physics things went fairly well until i got to quantum mechanics and there were about  people in the class by that point and it was so hard for me i just remember there was a point in this where i realized i’m never going to be a great physicist there were three or four people in the class whose brains were so clearly wired differently to process these highly abstract concepts so much more i was doing well in terms of the grades i was getting but for me it was laborious hard work and for some of these truly gifted folks — it was aweinspiring for me to watch them because in a very easy almost casual way they could absorb concepts and solve problems that i would work  hours on and it was a wonderful thing to behold at the same time i had been studying computer science and was really finding that that was something i was drawn toward i was drawn to that more and more and that turned out to be a great thing so i found — one of the great things princeton taught me is that i’m not smart enough to be a physicist what drew you to computer science what was it about computer science jeff bezos i was very very lucky because in fourth grade — which for me would have been around  — i had access to a mainframe computer there were no personal computers in  and there was a company in houston that had loaned excess mainframe computer time to this little elementary school and we had a teletype that was connected by an old acoustic modem you literally dialed a regular phone and picked up the handset and put it in this little cradle and nobody — none of the teachers knew how to operate this computer nobody did but there was a stack of manuals and me and a couple of other kids stayed after class and learned how to program this thing and that worked well for maybe about a week and then we learned that the mainframe programmers in some central location somewhere in houston had already programmed this computer to play star trek and from that day forward all we did was play star trek that is actually something i should have mentioned i used a large portion of my elementary school free time hours not only watching star trek — the original of course — but also playing star trek and everybody wanted to be — all of my friends — we all wanted to be spock and if you couldn’t be spock then you would be captain kirk and if you couldn’t be captain kirk then it started to separate people wanted to be different some people wanted to be bones i never wanted to be bones i would take as my third choice — if i couldn’t get spock or kirk — i would take the computer the computer was fun to play because people would ask you questions and they’d say “computer” and you’d say “working” why were you drawn to computer science jeff bezos i don’t know i think it’s always hard to know why you’re drawn to a particular thing i think part of it is if you have a facility with that thing of course it’s satisfying to do it and so in a way that’s selfreinforcing and certainly i always had a facility with computers i always got along well with them and they’re such extraordinary tools you can teach them to do things and then they actually do them it’s kind of an incredible tool that we’ve built here in the th century that was a love affair that really did start in the fourth grade and by the time i got to high school — i think when i was in th grade i got an apple ii plus — and continued fooling around with computers and then by the time i got to princeton i was taking all the computer classes and actually not just learning how to hack but learning about algorithms and some of the mathematics behind computer science and it’s fascinating it’s really a very involving and fun subject what were your intentions when you left princeton what did you set out to do jeff bezos i toyed with the idea of starting a company and even talked to a couple of friends about starting a company and ultimately decided that it would be smarter to wait and learn a little bit more about business and the way the world works you know one of the things that it’s very hard to believe when you’re  or  years old is that you don’t already know everything it turns out — people learn more and more as they get older — that you seem to learn you seem to realize that you know less and less every year that goes by i can only imagine that by the time i’m  i will realize i know nothing so that was i think a very good decision to not do that i went to work for a startup company but one in new york city that was building a network for helping brokerage firms clear trades it is kind of an obscure thing and it’s not very interesting to go into but it used my technical skills and it was very fun work and i loved the people i was working with from then on i started working at the intersection of computers and finance and stayed on wall street for a long time ultimately worked for a company that did this thing called quantitative hedge fund trading what we did was we programmed the computers and then the computers made stock trades and that was very interesting too and that was where i was working when i came across the fact that the web was growing at  percent a year and that’s what led to the forming of amazoncom you succeeded you became a phenomenon suddenly you’re talking about a lot of money a lot of investors a lot of responsibility and things don’t always go smoothly jeff bezos that’s for sure things never go smoothly how do you deal with that kind of pressure you must have felt during the past year jeff bezos it’s very interesting because the internet in general and amazoncom in particular is still chapter one you’re asking me about my story and it’s still the very beginning there’s still a lot of technology to be built a lot of innovations for customers to be built and the financial side of the story is still playing itself out in real time there’s a lot of visibility on the internet and there has been for the last couple of years for the first four years of the company we worked in relative obscurity we always had lots of supporters and we always had lots of skeptics and that’s still the same today it’s just that the level of visibility is so much higher if you look at the six years that we’ve been doing business in exactly one of those six years we were not the underdog that was  and that was the weird year for us now it’s much more normal it’s more what we’re used to do you have any doubts about the future of amazoncom jeff bezos we haven’t built a lasting company yet we still have a tremendous amount of hard work ahead of us but we have all the assets in place now we have eliminated the necessity for the luck that a startup company requires and now our future is in our own hands as a team and as a company and we have so many smart people we have so many customers who treat us so well and we have the right kind of culture that obsesses over the customer if there’s one reason we have done better than most of our peers in the internet space over the last six years it is because we have focused like a laser on customer experience and that really does matter i think in any business it certainly matters online where word of mouth is so very very powerful you know if you make a customer unhappy they won’t tell five friends they’ll tell  friends so we are at a point now where we have all of the things we need to build an important and lasting company and if we don’t it will be shame on us how do you deal with stress with pressure with setbacks with disappointments jeff bezos in my particular case i laugh a lot stress primarily comes from not taking action over something that you can have some control over so if i find that some particular thing is causing me to have stress that’s a warning flag for me what it means is there’s something that i haven’t completely identified perhaps in my conscious mind that is bothering me and i haven’t yet taken any action on it i find as soon as i identify it and make the first phone call or send off the first email message or whatever it is that we’re going to do to start to address that situation — even if it’s not solved — the mere fact that we’re addressing it dramatically reduces any stress that might come from it so stress comes from ignoring things that you shouldn’t be ignoring i think in large part so stress doesn’t come — people get stress wrong all the time in my opinion stress doesn’t come from hard work for example you know you can be working incredibly hard and loving it and likewise you can be out of work and incredibly stressed over that and likewise if you use that as an analogy for what i was just talking about if you’re out of work but you’re going through a disciplined approach a series of job interviews and so on and working to remedy that situation you are going to be a lot less stressed than if you’re just worrying about it and doing nothing what about dealing with success can that be a problem jeff bezos i don’t know if this is true for everybody but i suspect it is at a certain age the basic things about people are largely set i’m a lottery winner of a certain kind and i suspect if you were to survey lottery winners you would find that the core things about them don’t really change because they won the lottery people are always very curious about that how does it fundamentally change a person when they win a lottery i don’t think it does very much how do you explain to someone who has no idea what you do why you do it why do you do what you’re doing for a living what gives you the greatest sense of satisfaction about it jeff bezos i think one thing i find very motivating — and i think this is probably a very common form of motivation or cause of motivation is i love people counting on me and so you know today it’s so easy to be motivated because we have millions of customers counting on us at amazoncom we’ve got thousands of investors counting on us and we’re a team of thousands of employees all counting on each other that’s fun that’s also pressure isn’t it jeff bezos i don’t think so maybe for some people it would be fortunately there are a lot of different people motivated by a lot of different things my wife is working on a novel and that’s about as opposite as you could get in some ways because when you’re working on a novel you are really counting on yourself if you don’t finish that novel there aren’t a whole bunch of people counting on you to me that would be incredibly stressful because the amount of selfdiscipline required to have the follow through to do that even though nobody will say a single negative word if you just give up that’s hard if you ask me i have a lot of respect for novelists who are able to do that in your life have you ever considered giving up something you were doing jeff bezos well i gave up trying to be a great physicist and i’ll tell you that was very difficult for me i mean it’s something that i had my sights set on for a long time and it was a harsh realization that there were these aweinspiring people whose brains were just wired differently so yeah sure looking ahead is there some idea or problem or challenge that interests you jeff bezos on a personal level very interested in exploration of space since i was a little kid i have always been interested when i was at princeton i was president of seds which stands for students for the exploration and development of space if i ever get the chance i’d like to go investigate the moon and mars and tool around our solar system a little bit i don’t know if i’ll ever get that chance it’s technically a very hard problem if a young person came to you for advice “how do i make the most out of my life” what would you say to them jeff bezos do something you’re very passionate about and don’t try to chase what is kind of the ‘hot passion’ of the day i think we actually saw this i think you see it all over the place in many different contexts but i think we saw it in the internet world quite a bit where at sort of the peak of the internet mania in — say  — you found people who were very passionate of something and they kind of left that job and decided “i’m going to do something on the internet because it’s almost like the  gold rush in a way” i mean you find that people — if you go back and study the history of the  gold rush you find that at that time everybody who was within shouting distance of california was — you know they might have been a doctor but they quit being a doctor and they started panning for gold and that almost never works and even if it does work according to some metric financial success or whatever it might be i suspect it leaves you ultimately unsatisfied so you really need to be very clear with yourself and i think one of the best ways to do that is this notion of projecting yourself forward to age  looking back on your life and trying to make sure you’ve minimized the number of regrets you have that works for career decisions it works for family decisions i have a month old son and it’s very easy for me to — if i think about myself when i’m  i know i want to watch that little guy grow up and so it’s — i don’t want to be  and think “shoot you know i missed that whole thing and i don’t have the kind of relationship with my son that i wished i had” and so on and so on another thing that i would recommend to people is that they always take a longterm point of view i think this is something about which there’s a lot of controversy a lot of people — and i’m just not one of them — believe that you should live for the now i think what you do is think about the great expanse of time ahead of you and try to make sure that you’re planning for that in a way that’s going to leave you ultimately satisfied this is the way it works for me there are a lot of paths to satisfaction and you need to find one that works for you what kind of responsibility goes along with the kind of success you’ve had jeff bezos if you are a lottery winner as i am then one of the things that you get a chance to do at some point in your life is to be a philanthropist and so i didn’t grow up hoping “boy maybe i’ll be a philanthropist one day” that wasn’t ever on my list of archeologist astronaut those things i wanted to be physicist i think in large part because i never expected to have the means to be a philanthropist but i think that if you win a lottery of this kind of size that one of the things that over time you have an obligation to do is to think about the ways that that wealth can be used in a highly leveraged way i also think by the way it’s really easy to give away money in highly unleveraged ways where it’s just a waste of money and i suspect that it takes as much time energy focus and hard work to effectively give away money as it does to get it in the first place what’s important to you and why jeff bezos i think one of the things that’s most important to me is one of the notions that the united states was founded on and that is liberty it’s a very difficult thing there’s lots of very interesting stuff to think about in this regard and it just so happens that a free market economy sort of a capitalist system has a lot of liberty mixed in with it we all get to decide how we’re going to go about making our own living and so on and so on that happens to also be a very effective way of deploying an economy so that you get an economy which mostly makes sense you know things mysteriously — because of that invisible hand — tend to work out i remember there was a time — i may have these statistics slightly wrong — a few years ago there was a heat wave in the south that killed three percent of chickens and i think egg prices doubled because there were three percent fewer chickens well that means that the number of chickens is roughly right even though there’s nobody deciding how many chickens there should be so that is a very interesting fact i think that a free market economy — which by necessity involves a lot of liberty — just happens to work well in terms of allocating resources but imagine a different world imagine a world where some incredibly artificially intelligent computer could actually do a better job than the invisible hand of allocating resources and were to say “there shouldn’t be this many chickens there should be this many chickens” just a few more or a few less well that might even lead to more aggregate wealth so it might be a society that if you give up liberty everybody could be a little wealthier now the question that i would pose is if that turned out to be the world “is that a good trade” personally i don’t think so personally i think it would be a terrible trade and i sometimes worry about that because i think it’s a coincidence that liberty tends to do such a good job of creating an economy that functions well do you have any concerns about what role the computer may play in our lives in the years ahead jeff bezos not the computer per se but i do often have concerns about the role that technology more generally may play in the years ahead you know if you look over long periods of time look over hundreds of years and look at the average sort of life cycle of a new technology what you find is that it’s getting compressed and compressed and compressed so the rate of change is getting faster and faster every decade that goes by there’s more important discoveries per unit time than there were in the previous decade and a lot of these discoveries tend to have two uses i mean technologies tend to be agnostic with respect to whether they can be used for good or used for evil i think that over the next  years we are going to face a lot of very tough decisions as a society in how we make sure that we are harnessing those technologies for good purposes what does the american dream mean to you jeff bezos i think i already answered it because i think the american dream is about liberty but i’ll add one other thing to what i said earlier liberty giving people the freedom to do what they want — as long as they’re not hurting somebody else — is super important i think it’s the core essence of the american dream i think at times we as a people get confused about it i think people should carefully reread the first part of the declaration of independence because i think sometimes we as a society start to get confused and think that we have a right to happiness but if you read the declaration of independence it talks about “life liberty and the pursuit of happiness” nobody has a right to happiness you should have a right to pursue it and i think the core of that is liberty thank you very much it has been my pleasure read full interview jeffrey p bezos
