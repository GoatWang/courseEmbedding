oversight of investment funds in that jurisdiction an offshore fund is a term which generally refers to a collective investment scheme domiciled in an offshore jurisdiction like the term offshore company the term is more descriptive than definitive and both the words offshore and fund may be construed differently the reference to offshore in the classic case usually means a traditional offshore jurisdiction such as the cayman islands jersey or the british virgin islands however the term is also frequently used to include other corporate domiciles popular for cross border investment structuring such as delaware and luxembourg in the widest sense offshore is sometimes used to include any type of cross border collective investment scheme and popular fund domiciles such as ireland may be included within the definition of offshore notwithstanding their substantial size as a country similarly although the reference to fund can be taken to include any sort of collective investment within offshore jurisdictions themselves the term offshore fund is often limited to purely openended investment funds ie a fund where the investor can redeem his investment during the life of the fund where the investment is by way of equity rather than by debt this is often because closedended investment funds where the investor cannot redeem out and funds where the investment is structured by way of debt are not normally subject to the usual regulatory requirements for investments funds and so are not treated as funds in the stricter sense of that word although the term is often used as a simply descriptive one many onshore countries have specific definitions in their legislation or their tax codes for when an investment is treated as an offshore fund for example in the united kingdom

similar regulatory regime in relation to funds formed in their country typically the regulatory regime will take a two tier approach making a distinction between funds which are offered generally to members of the public which will require a high degree of regulation because of the nature of potential investors and nonpublic funds nonpublic funds are usually either categorised as private funds or professional funds or some equivalent label typically investors in nonpublic funds can be assumed to be sophisticated because of the nature of the offering – there may for example be a high minimum initial investment say us andor a requirement that investors establish that they are professional investors although some offshore jurisdictions allow investors to selfcertify this alternatively the fund may be designed for a small and select group of investors and the constitutional documents will limit the number of investors say to no more than  although most offshore jurisdictions permit funds to obtain licences to operate as public funds the onerous regulatory requirements associated with such licences usually means that only a small minority of offshore funds are available for subscription by the general publiccitation needed most offshore domiciling of funds tends to be regulatory driven rather than tax driven the relative absence of regulation relating to leveraging and investment strategies in offshore jurisdictions encourages higher risk funds such as hedge funds to form themselves in those jurisdictions onshoreedit increasingly economically developed countries are imposing direct regulation on offshore funds who wish to market to investors in those countries the most recent example of this is the alternative investment fund managers directive aifmd which requires funds to comply with extensive rules and regulations in order to be able to market to investors within the european union taxationedit offshoreedit typically the offshore jurisdiction in which a fund is incorporated will not impose any direct taxation on the income of the fund nor will it impose any withholding or similar income taxes on distributions by the fund to its investors however this does not normally operate to exempt the fund from taxes which may arise as a result of its investment activities in other countries so for example if a fund formed in the cayman islands realises a capital gain on trade in new york it will still normally be liable for us capital gains tax in the usual way similarly if a person domiciled in the united kingdom invests in a guernsey fund they will still be liable to taxation of income and capital gains received under british tax laws subject to the rules on remittance of foreign earned income notwithstanding the absence of any taxation imposed in guernsey onshoreedit different onshore countries treat income arising from offshore funds in different ways us citizens are generally subject to taxation on foreign earned investment income regardless of whether they live in the world and where the income is remitted to under british tax rules the taxability of foreign earned income depends upon the domicile of the tax payer and whether the funds are remitted to the united kingdom there is a public perception that offshore investment funds are responsible for tax leakage in relation to cross border investment and various laws have been passed by various countries shaped by that belief probably the best example of that is the american foreign account tax compliance act fatca but earlier examples also included the application of the european union withholding tax to the british overseas territories including popular offshore fund domiciles like the cayman islands and the british virgin islands the most recent and ongoing example is the convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters which almost every major offshore fund domicile has agreed to be bound by criticismedit critics such as
