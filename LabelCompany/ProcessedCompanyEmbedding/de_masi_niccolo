company on tuesday — a phone that is the underdog in a world of giants the scrappy person company essential revealed a titanium and ceramic phone ahead of the code conference in rancho palos verdes california where rubin is slated to speak on tuesday night in addition to its expansive screen and damageresistant exterior the phone also sports a magnetic port for attachments essential has no small task before it its taking on two of the worlds richest public companies apple and alphabet its also competing with companies like samsung amazon and facebook in its home and vr platforms but as content like mr robot or the circle demonizes big tech essential hopes to paint itself as a defender of american consumers the first attachment is one of the smallest degree cameras on the market the exterior also allows a thinner phone with a larger screen than iphones or pixels — at a time when consumers are choosing between phones that all look the same said niccolo de masi president and chief operating officer of essential told cnbc on tuesday it used to mean something — your selection your choice said de masi formerly of glu mobile he said that consumers perceive their smartphone choices

looking into ceramic finishes copycatting runs rampant in silicon valley often to great success most recently facebooks instagram recreated many wellloved snapchat features apple once waged war on samsung over intellectual property surrounding the iphone apple itself has been accused of copying xerox de masi said he expects essential to be copied there is a fair amount of intellectual property protecting our devices de masi but at the same time consumers dont care about that as much as who was first i dont think people get much credence in the western world for being copycats we know people

those de masi doesnt think that asian brands like xiaomi will expand as love brands in the us despite their cheaper prices even if essential used foreign suppliers prototyping in silicon valley keeps essential at the bleeding edge of innovation de masi said there is room in the market in the western world for another what i call love brand de masi said i think apple has done a good job on that over the past  years i think everyone else has either retrenched or are seen as foreign brands other brands like motorola and even google have tried to release modular phones with interchangeable parts to little success but de masi said that the manufacturing process has become easy enough that creating nimble beautiful phones is now easier and cheaper but despite his criticism of other cookiecutter phones de masi said that essentials modular phones will not enable options like changing the color of chassis because they are not meaningful innovation one of the first arenas where essential will compete is vr specifically  videos its an area that googles daydream and even facebook are trying to win new essential smartphones in black and white with degree video attachment we believe its going to democratize video de masi said in this case the hardwares going to allow the format to be unleashed before this you had to buy a device as big as my fist for  or more  it changes the perspective of all events even news in  all of the sudden you get truth in whats going on at all times most people argue about perspective and argue about the timeline i think it would change truth in news and truth in things like demonstrations de masi said theres no launch date yet but that rubin is very aggressive about bringing the products to market quickly the next attachment could be some kind of recorder he said only about half of what were working on has even been hinting at de masi said so we look forward to keeping the roadmap aggressive anita balakrishnannews associate
