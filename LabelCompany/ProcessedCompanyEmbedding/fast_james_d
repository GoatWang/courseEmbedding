the us air force as a mechanic in  and ended his service as a flight engineer aboard b peacemakers and c flying boxcars the gi bill paid his way through purdue university an aeronautical engineer he joined the boeing co as it was entering the jetliner age he transitioned from there into a modifier of aircraft which delivered a roller coaster of experiences he founded his current firm in 8 and its products have enjoyed great market acceptance today the raisbeck foundation supports a number of arts educational and medical institutions in the seattle area as well as raisbeck aviation high school you’re seen as a maverick how did you get on at a colossus like boeing raisbeck i began as a research aerodynamicist my first boss was dr bernie gratzer a wonderful fellow who went on to design the elliptical winglet for aviation partners inc  in  they made me a manager in dayton to deal with wrightpatterson i was  and a former enlisted guy meeting with generals — quite a challenge three years later i was back in seattle working on the preliminary design for what became nasa’s qsra or quiet stol research aircraft it was a de havilland buffalo with jet engines and blown flaps we said the qs stood for “quite silly” because some thought it was i left boeing in  and can honestly say i loved everything i did there and then ventured out on your own raisbeck i initially ran robertson aircraft which did stol conversions on singles and light twins then started raisbeck group and worked with dee howard on developing the mark ii performance improvement package for learjets that got the attention of rockwell which was developing the sabre  they contracted us to design and deliver the first supercritical wing in general aviation and as part of that i got to do the mod for existing sabre 6s well i hired a lot of people — at one point we had 6 employees we delivered  wing shipsets to rockwell every one at a loss we were working on our th inservice installation when rockwell called in my bank loan everything collapsed at that point i almost lost my house i was feeling sorry for myself at a bar when a guy says “are you jim raisbeck” i said “what do i owe you” turned out i owed his machine shop  but then he said “get yourself useful again” and that he’d then do business with me again that’s what i did and that’s what he did rockwell gave me the opportunity to start over and salvation came in the form of the king air raisbeck the first system our current company designed was the fully enclosed main landing gear on the king air  our first delivery was in july  followed by the mark vi performance improvement system that proved to be so popular we kept at it designing wing lockers the following year and new props after that across all models of king airs we currently have four new active programs for the king air  we introduced two new hartzell sweptblade props for the  at nbaa this year and are developing a ram air recovery system and drag reduction package for it beyond that raisbeck designs are now on all three new production king air models all totaled over  king airs have some raisbeck systems that’s more than 6 of the fleet so the king air is your golden goose raisbeck well we’re proud of our other products such as our lear lockers and zr lite performance system but historically the single biggest hit was our stage  noise reduction kit for the boeing 7 it sold for  to  depending on the model we did 7 aircraft making it our most lucrative program so that just proves it isn’t how hard you hit it’s knowing where with that history what lessons can you share raisbeck be careful of big corporations never go into debt keep things small — we’ve got just 8 employees now including me and we stay focused  stay one drink behind the slowest drinker always tell the truth and you won’t have to worry about remembering what you said and finally if you can take an apparently unsolvable problem break it down into parts and solve those put them all back together and do that in your head then you’re a real engineer  print favorite email tweet please log in or register to post comments advertisement related articlesraisbeck adds two new swept
