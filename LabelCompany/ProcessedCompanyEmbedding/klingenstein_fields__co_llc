members working with us wealth planning investment managementyour customized portfolioyour trusted partner our strategies core equity strategy news  insights contact client login global value strategy the manager of the global value strategy believes that valuation discipline is a key ingredient to successful investment outcomes as a result we search across the globe for companies that appear out of favor with significant earnings prospects that we believe are selling at major discount  in many cases to intrinsic value we try to maintain a  split between us and nonus holdings our investment process is labor intensive with rigid parameters on valuation we seek to identify situations where other investors have reacted emotionally this gives us an opportunity to buy the shares of businesses that would otherwise be considered cash generating machines at very attractive prices where we believe there is limited incremental downside risk  to find these opportunities we run a series of weekly screens across global markets that highlight companies trading at multiyear lows and businesses that are available at low multiples to earnings we eliminate financially weak companies and insist that our new idea list only contain businesses with minimal debt service and strong free cash flow we will initiate a position if shares can be purchased at a  discount to its intrinsic or private market value and we feel that it has  upside potential over a  year period investment strategy advantages historically owning highquality undervalued companies for the long term has produced superior returns in comparison to other investment strategies highquality companies tend to have stable business models that perform well in both good and bad economic times investment characteristics low debt ratios strong free cash flow strong prospective earnings momentum low earnings multiples ﻿ klingenstein fields  co llc cuts stake in abbvie inc nyseabbv  week herald daily ratings and news for abbvie inc
