provided for customers who engage in trading outside normal market hours  such trading involves certain risks explained below risk of lower liquidity  liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and sell securities generally the more orders that are available in a market the greater the liquidity liquidity is important because with greater liquidity it is easier for investors to buy or sell securities and as a result investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities purchased or sold there may be lower liquidity in extended hours trading as compared to regular market hours as a result your order may only be partially executed or not at all risk of higher volatility  volatility refers to the changes in price that securities undergo when trading generally the higher the volatility of a security the greater its price swings there may be greater volatility in extended hours trading than in regular market hours as a result your order may only be partially executed or not at all or you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours risk of changing prices  the prices of securities traded in extended hours trading may not reflect the prices either at the end of regular market hours or upon the opening of the next morning as a result you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours risk of unlinked markets  depending on the extended hours trading system or the time of day the prices displayed on a particular extended hours system may not reflect the prices in other concurrently operating extended hours trading systems dealing in the same securities accordingly you may receive an inferior price in one extended hours trading system than you would in another extended hours trading system risk of news announcements  normally issuers make news announcements that may affect the price of their securities after regular market hours similarly important financial information is frequently announced outside of regular market hours in extended hours trading these announcements may occur during trading and if combined with lower liquidity and higher volatility it may cause an exaggerated and unsustainable effect on the price of a security risk of wider spreads  the spread refers to the difference in price between what you can buy a security for and what you can sell it for lower liquidity and higher volatility in extended hours trading may result in wider than normal spreads for a particular security risk of lack of calculation or dissemination of underlying index value or intraday indicative value “iiv”  for certain derivative securities products such as exchangetraded funds etfs an updated underlying index value or iiv may not be calculated or publicly disseminated in extended trading hours since the underlying index value and iiv are not calculated or widely disseminated during the premarket and postmarket sessions an investor who is unable to calculate implied values for certain derivative securities products in those sessions may be at a disadvantage to market

to provide some basic facts about purchasing securities on margin and to alert you to the risks involved with trading securities in a margin account before trading stocks in a margin account you should carefully review this margin disclosure and the margin agreement provided to you by b riley when you purchase securities you may pay for the securities in full or you may borrow part of the purchase price from your brokerage firm if you choose to borrow funds in connection with your account you will be required to open a margin account which will be carried by b riley the securities purchased in such an account are collateral for the loan to you if the securities in your margin account decline in value so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan and as a result b riley is required to take action such as issue a margin call andor sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts in order to maintain the required level of equity in the account it is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin these risks include the following you can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account a decline in the value of securities that are purchased on margin may require you to provide additional funds to the firm that has made the loan to avoid the forced sale of those securities or other securities or assets in your accounts your brokerage firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your accounts if the equity in your account falls below the maintenance margin requirements or b rileys higher house requirements b riley may be required to sell the securities or other assets in any of your accounts to cover the margin deficiency you also will be responsible for any short fall in the account after such a sale your brokerage firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you some investors mistakenly believe that a firm must contact them for a margin call to be valid and that the firm cannot liquidate securities or other assets in their accounts to meet the call unless the firm has contacted them first this is not the case a brokerage firm may attempt to notify customers of margin calls but it is not required to do so however even if your b riley has contacted you and provided a specific date by which you can meet a margin call b riley can still take necessary steps to protect its financial interests including immediately selling assets without notice to you you are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your accounts are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call because the securities are collateral for the margin loan b riley has the right to decide which security or other asset to sell in order to protect its interests your brokerage firm may move securities held in your cash account to your margin account and pledge or rehypothecate the transferred securities any such pledge or rehypothecation may result in a benefit to b riley and result in your becoming a general unsecured creditor of your brokerage firm with respect to the securities so pledged or rehypothecated the firm can increase its house maintenance margin requirements at any time and is not required to provide you advance written notice these changes in firm policy often take effect immediately and may result in the issuance of a maintenance margin call your failure to satisfy the call may cause your firm to liquidate or sell securities or other assets in your accounts you are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call while an extension of time to meet margin requirements may be available to customers under certain conditions a customer does not have a right to the extension b riley brokerage firm has entered

for your brokerage firm with respect to your account clearing firm extends the margin credit to you and carries your margin loan clearing firm is a beneficiary of your representations warranties acknowledgments and covenants in the margin agreement including without limitation your authorizations indemnifications waivers and releases to the same extent as if they were made directly by you to the clearing firm the clearing firm in its own name and for its own benefit is entitled to exercise and enforce directly against you the margin agreement all other rights granted to your brokerage
