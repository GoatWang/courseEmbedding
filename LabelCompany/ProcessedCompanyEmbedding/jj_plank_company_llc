moonstone click to close click to openspec  moonstone epoxyteflon roll covering compound is a superior compound of a finely woven mat impregnated with a unique composition of epoxy and teflon  the material is applied directly to your roll core under heat and high tension without the need for any bonding agent or adhesive  the material is then thermally cured at temperatures up to ° f ° c  this combination of the wrapping process and the curing cycle results in a hard durable corrosionfree covering which is stiff but lightweight and longwearing  as machine speeds and wirefabric tensions increase many papermakers have discovered that traditional rubber covers deteriorate resulting in reduced forming fabric life  moonstone’s special formulation combining epoxy and teflon results in a bonehard cover exhibiting exceptional “nonstick” characteristics even in the harsh wet end atmospherereel tuff click to close click to openspec reel tuff antistatic roll covering compound has the same outstanding properties as our jadestone™ roll covering compound which is used throughout the paper machine – wet end or dry end  the unique difference is that our reel tuff roll cover performs as an electrical conductor  the reel tuff covering compound is a unique composition combining extremely high tensile and compressive strengths with a superior bonding capability  these covers are applied directly to your reel spools and roll cores without the need for a bonding agent and the problems associated with them  the covering cannot separate from the core crack break fray or expose jagged edges on the surface of the roll  spec  reel tuff will eliminate all safety problems related to the discharge of static electricity due to high speeds in dry environmentsjadestone click to close click to openspec  jadestone™ epoxy composite material is a superior composition of a finely woven mat impregnated with epoxy resin  our curing process incorporates temperatures above °f  this combination provides a hard durable corrosionfree roll covering which is lightweight and long wearing  jadestone™ is onehalf as light as aluminum nearly as hard as chilled iron three times as durable as hard rubber and will polish to a  rms micro finish  jadestone™ epoxy composite has a finer finish than ‘fiberglass’ roll coverings and will not break fray or separate and it helps increase the stiffness of the roll body thus reducing deflectionsheraton click to close click to openthe papermaker has long recognized that a  hz shake applied throughout the forming section of slow speed paper machines ie less than  fpm or  mmin is perhaps the most favorable environment available for producing uniform quality papers  this situation exists because such a shake creates an almost continuous oscillating cd shear or finescale turbulence throughout the forming zone however few paper machines run this slow any longer  when a comparable shake is applied to a high speed machine like one running at  fpm it introduces a fresh cd pulse into the stock only once every  feet of travel down the machine thereby losing most of its effectiveness so few machines today running over  fpm employ a shake  instead they depend on a number of other devices primarily freedraining and vacuumaugmented foils to maintain stock dispersed throughout the forming zone  these devices have never been as effective as a  hz shake on a  fpm machinemanufacturing click to close click to openbadger roll  machine is committed to helping you along with our many years of experience with all types of roll manufacturing  this
