filed june   field of the inventionthis invention relates to industrial rolls and more particularly to rolls for papermaking backgroundin a typical papermaking process a water slurry or suspension of cellulosic fibers known as the paper stock is fed onto the top of the upper run of an endless belt of woven wire andor synthetic material that travels between two or more rolls the belt often referred to as a forming fabric provides a papermaking surface on the upper surface of its upper run which operates as a filter to separate the cellulosic fibers of the paper stock from the aqueous medium thereby forming a wet paper web the aqueous medium drains through mesh openings of the forming fabric known as drainage holes by gravity or vacuum located on the lower surface of the upper run ie the machine side of the fabric after leaving the forming section the paper web is transferred to a press section of the paper machine where it is passed through the nips of one or more presses often roller presses covered with another fabric typically referred to as a press felt pressure from the presses removes additional moisture from the web the moisture removal is often enhanced by the presence of a batt layer of the press felt the paper is then transferred to a dryer section for further moisture removal after drying the paper is ready for secondary processing and packaging cylindrical rolls are typically utilized in different sections of a papermaking machine such as the press section such rolls reside and operate in demanding environments in which they can be exposed to high dynamic loads and temperatures and aggressive or corrosive chemical agents as an example in a typical paper mill rolls are used not only for transporting the fibrous web sheet between processing stations but also in the case of press section and calender rolls for processing the web sheet itself into paper typically rolls used in papermaking are constructed with the location within the papermaking machine in mind as rolls residing in different positions within the papermaking machines are required to perform different functions because papermaking rolls can have many different performance demands and because replacing an entire metallic roll can be quite expensive many papermaking rolls include a polymeric cover that surrounds the circumferential surface of a typically metallic core by varying the material employed in the cover the cover designer can provide the roll with different performance characteristics as the papermaking application demands also repairing regrinding or replacing a cover over a metallic roll can be considerably less expensive than the replacement of an entire metallic roll exemplary polymeric materials for covers include natural rubber synthetic rubbers such as neoprene styrenebutadiene sbr nitrile rubbers chlorosulfonated polyethylene cspe  also known under the trade name hypalon from dupont edpm the name given to an ethylenepropylene terpolymer formed of ethylenepropylene diene monomer polyurethane thermoset composites and thermoplastic composites in many instances the roll cover will include at least two distinct layers a base layer that overlies the core and provides a bond thereto and a topstock layer that overlies and bonds to the base layer and serves the outer surface of the roll some rolls will also include an intermediate tiein layer sandwiched by the base and top stock layers the layers for these materials are typically selected to provide the cover with a prescribed set of physical properties for operation these can include the requisite strength elastic modulus and resistance to elevated temperature water and harsh chemicals to withstand the papermaking environment in addition covers are typically designed to have a predetermined surface hardness that is appropriate for the process they are to perform and they typically require that the paper sheet release from the cover without damage to the paper sheet also in order to be economical the cover should be abrasion and wearresistant as the paper web is conveyed through a papermaking machine it can be very important to understand the pressure profile experienced by the paper web variations in pressure can impact the amount of water drained from the web which can affect the ultimate sheet moisture content thickness and other properties the magnitude of pressure applied with a roll can therefore impact the quality of paper produced with the paper machine other properties of a roll can also be important for example the stress and strain experienced by the roll cover in the cross machine direction can provide information about the durability and dimensional stability of the cover in addition the temperature profile of the roll can assist in identifying potential problem areas of the cover it is known to include pressure andor temperature sensors in the cover of an industrial roll for example us patent no  to moschel et al describes a roll with a helicallydisposed leads that includes a plurality of pressure sensors embedded in the polymeric cover of the roll the sensors are helically disposed in order to provide pressure readings at different axial locations along the length of the roll typically the sensors are connected by a signal carrying member that transmits sensor signals to a processor that processes the signals and provides pressure and position information more particularly as each sensor passes through a nip the sensor becomes loaded and emits a signal the sensor then becomes unloaded after it passes through the nip however the sensors are serially connected by the signal carrying member and sensor signals can overlap or superimpose if more than one sensor is passing through a nip at the same time accordingly the system may not produce an accurate pressure profile in certain applications the sensor signals can overlap in extended or wide nip applications for example an industrial roll can be positioned relative to a mating structure such as a shoe of a shoe press to form a relatively wide nip therewith in this instance at least adjacent sensors can be located in the nip at the same time and this can result in erroneous measurements signals can also overlap or be superimposed in applications in which a roll is positioned so as to mate with multiple mating structures thereby creating multiple nips exemplary applications include grouped rolls in a press section and rolls in a calendering section in these instances at least one sensor can be in each nip at a particular time again this can result in erroneous measurements summaryas a first aspect embodiments of the present invention are directed to an industrial roll the industrial roll

and  to gustafson the roll  can be manufactured in the manner described for example in us patent application publication no  to moore et al and copending us patent application no  to pak as described in these applications the cover  may comprise multiple layers for example the core  may be covered with an inner base layer and the signal carrying member  and sensors  may then be positioned and adhered in place an outer base layer may then be applied and a topstock layer may be applied over the outer base layer the present invention is intended to include rolls having covers  that include only a base layer and top stock layer as well as rolls having covers with additional intermediate layers any intermediate layers may be applied over the outer base layer prior to the application of the topstock layer in some embodiments the sensors  may be at least partially embedded in a layer in some other embodiments the sensors  may be between two layers such that the sensors  are on top of one layer and covered by a second different layer the completed roll  and cover  can then be used in for example a papermaking machine in some embodiments the roll  is part of a nip press wherein one or more rolls or pressing devices are positioned adjacent the roll  to form one or more nips through which a forming paper web can pass in such environments it can be important to monitor the pressure experienced by the cover  particularly in the nip areas the sensing system  can provide pressure information for different axial locations along the cover  with each of the sensors  providing pressure information about a different axial location on the roll  in some other embodiments the roll  is part of a calendering section to provide a finish to the paper product it is noted that in calendering applications the roll cover may be polymeric cotton or chilled iron with the sensors at least partially embedded in the cover still referring to figure  the sensors  of the sensing system  are suitable for detecting an operating parameter of the roll  such as pressure the sensors  can take any shape or form recognized by those skilled in this art including piezoelectric sensors optical sensors and the like exemplary sensors are discussed in us patent nos  to moore  to moschel et al  to meller  to gustafson and  to gustafson us patent application publication no  to moore et al and copending us patent application nos  to pak and  to pak the signal carrying member  of the sensing system  can be any signalcarrying member recognized by those skilled in this art as being suitable for the passage of electrical signals in a roll in some embodiments the signal carrying member  may comprise a pair of leads each one contacting a different portion of each sensor  as described for example in the aforementioned us patent application no  to pak the sensing system  includes a multiplexer  or other data collection device mounted to the end of the roll  the multiplexer  receives and collects signals from the sensors  and transmits them to a processor  the processor  is typically a personal computer or similar data exchange device such as the distributive control system of a paper mill that is operatively associated with the sensors  and that can process signals from the sensors  into useful easily understood information in some embodiments a wireless communication mode such as rf signaling is used to transmit the data collected from the sensors  from the multiplexer  to the processor  other alternative configurations include slip ring connectors that enable the signals to be transmitted from the sensors  to the processor  suitable exemplary processing units are discussed in us patent nos  and  to moore  to moschel et al and  to gustafson et al in operation the roll  and cover  rotate about the axis of the roll  at very high speeds each time one of the sensors  passes through a nip created by the roll  and a mating roll or press the sensor  will transmit a pulse generated by the pressure the mating roll exerts on the area of the roll  above the sensor  when no sensor  is present in the nip no significant pulses beyond the level of general noise are generated thus as the roll  rotates each sensor  travels through the nip and provides pulses representative of the pressure at its corresponding location consequently data in the form of pulses is generated by the sensors  transmitted along the signal carrying member  and received in the multiplexer  in a typical data retrieval session  pulses are received per sensor  these individual pulses can be stored and processed into representative pressure signals for each sensor  once the raw sensor data is collected it is sent from the multiplexer  to the processor  for processing into an easily understood form such as a pressure profile of the roll  along its length figure  illustrates a portion of the roll  including the sensors  serially connected by the signal carrying member  the sensors  are typically evenly spaced axially although in some applications such as rolls used in the production of tissue the sensors may be more concentrated near the ends of the roll typically one helix curves fully around the roll  such that each sensor  is positioned at a unique axial and circumferential position thereby allowing an operating parameter to be measured at each position helical sensor configurations are described in more detail in the aforementioned us patent no  to moschel et al and the aforementioned us patent application publication no  to moore et al figure  is a graph illustrating an exemplary signal transmitted from the signal carrying member  as each sensor  enters a nip it becomes loaded and emits a pulse represented by one of the inverted peaks p in the signal each sensor  becomes unloaded as it leaves the nip a baseline b is established between the inverted peaks p nip pressure is determined by pulse height or amplitude which is the difference between the inverted peaks p and the baseline b ideally and as illustrated in figure  all sensors  will be unloaded such that a consistent baseline b is established between the peaks p however this will not be the case when the roll  is used in certain applications in which more than one sensor  is partially or fully loaded at the same time because the signal carrying member  serially connects the sensors  there is only one signal which is the sum of the output from all the sensors  figure  is a graph illustrating another exemplary signal transmitted by the signal carrying member  in which the pulses p overlap in this example adjacent sensors  are partially loaded at the same time this alters the baseline b ie shifts the baseline downward and therefore reduces the pulse height resulting in erroneous measurements this problem may occur in extended or wide nip applications the sensor system of the roll  illustrated in figures  and  may be appropriate for nips approximately  inch wide such as some nips formed between two rolls in a press section however extended or wide nips such as those formed when the roll mates with a shoe of a shoe press can be up to  inches wide and can sometimes be even wider as a result in these applications pulses from at least two adjacent sensors  can overlap the angular or circumferential spacing between adjacent sensors  could be increased however this would result in a reduced total number of sensors  and a profile with large void spaces between measurement locations sensor positions figure  illustrates an embodiment that can overcome the problems encountered in wide nip applications a roll  includes a sensing system including a first set of sensors  and a second set of sensors  the sensors  of the first set are distinct from the sensors  of the second set the sensors   are arranged in helical configurations around the roll  each sensor   is configured to sense an operating parameter eg pressure experienced by the roll  and provide signals related to the operating parameter the sensing system also includes first and second signal carrying members   the first signal carrying member  serially connects the first set of sensors  and the second signal carrying member  serially connects the second set of sensors  in the illustrated embodiment the axial distance between adjacent sensors  of the first set is increased eg doubled as compared to the axial distance between adjacent sensors  of the roll  illustrated in figures  and  likewise the axial distance between adjacent sensors  of the second set is increased eg doubled as compared to axial distance between adjacent sensors  of the roll  this configuration can increase the time between the signal peaks from adjacent sensors of an individual signal carrying member   these increased durations can eliminate the overlapping signals that can be encountered from sensors serially connected by a single signal carrying member the sensing system also includes a signal processing unit or device that is operatively associated with the first signal carrying member  and therefore the first set of sensors  and the second signal carrying member  and therefore the second set of sensors  the signal processing unit or device is configured to selectively monitor or receive data from the signals provided by the first and second set of sensors   in some embodiments the signal processing unit or device is configured to alternately monitor or receive data from the first signal carrying member  and the second signal carrying member  the signal processing unit or device is described in more detail below in some embodiments and as illustrated in figure  the sensors  of the first set and the sensors  of the second set alternate within the helical configuration the first signal carrying member  can bypass the sensors  of the second set and the second signal carrying member  can bypass the sensors  of the first set as used herein a signal carrying member bypassing one or more sensors means that the signal carrying member docs not contact the one or more sensors the signal carrying member may bypass a sensor by passing above below andor around the sensor the signal carrying member may be at least partially embedded at a different depth in the cover of the roll as the particular sensor being bypassed eg in the case of a signal carrying member passing above or below the sensor or may be at least partially embedded at the same or substantially the same depth in the cover of the roll as the particular sensor being bypassed eg in the case of a signal carrying member passing around the sensor as illustrated the first signal carrying member  may curve around the sensors  of the second set and the second signal carrying member  may curve around the sensors  of the first set figures  and  are graphs illustrating exemplary signals transmitted from signal carrying members  and  respectively as described above and as shown in figure  the time between pulses p from adjacent sensors  increases due to the increased axial spacing of sensors  this helps to ensure that the pulses p do not overlap and likewise helps to ensure that a proper baseline b is established similarly as shown in figure  the time between pulses p from adjacent sensors  increases due to the increased axial spacing of sensors  and this helps to ensure that the pulses p do not overlap and helps to ensure that a proper baseline b is established after monitoring the signal from the first set of sensors  eg after the pulse p but before the pulse p the processor  can switch and monitor the signal from the second set of sensors  eg the pulse p illustrated in figure  the processor  may switch between monitoring the first and second set of sensors   in various ways in some embodiments the processor  is configured to alternately monitor the signals from the first set of sensors  and the second set of sensors  therefore by employing multiple sets of sensors that can be selectively monitored erroneous measurements due to pulse overlapping can be minimized or prevented and sensor coverage on the roll is not compromised thereby allowing for an accurate and comprehensive roll profile as described above the roll  can be particularly useful when positioned relative to a mating structure to form a relatively wide nip therewith to illustrate figure  shows mating structure  for example a shoe of a shoe press positioned relative to the roll  to form a relatively wide nip  therewith the sensing system described above can be configured such that no more than one sensor  of the first sensor set and no more than one sensor  of the second sensor set is positioned in the nip  simultaneously although two sets of sensors and two signal carrying members have been described in detail above and illustrated in figure  it is envisioned that more than two sensor sets could be employed as needed with each sensor set connected by an individual signal carrying member more than two sensor sets may be needed for example in applications involving particularly wide nips rolls and sensing systems such as the one illustrated in figures  and  can also be incompatible with multiple nip configurations examples of such configurations are grouped rolls in a press section figure  and calender sections figure  in figure  press rolls   are positioned relative to press roll  to form nips n n therewith similarly in figure  calender rolls   are positioned relative to calender roll  to form nips n n therewith if the roll  as illustrated in figures  and  were used in place of roll  or roll  at least one sensor  may be at least partially loaded in each nip n n or each nip n n at a particular time during operation this can result in at least two signals overlapping or being superimposed because the sensors  are all serially connected by the signal carrying member  in the case of overlapping signals the baseline may be altered as described in more detail above moreover superimposed signals can lead to confusion as to which signal corresponds to which nip to overcome the problem of at least one sensor being loaded in more than one nip simultaneously the angular or circumferential spacing of the sensors  shown in figures  and  could be reduced this would in turn reduce the helix angle defined by sensors  such that the helix formed by the sensors  would not wrap completely around the roll  however to maintain the same number of sensors the axial spacing between adjacent sensors would need to be reduced this may lead to the same problems described above with regard to extended or wide nip applications ie more than one sensor could be positioned in a single nip at the same time and signals may overlap figure  illustrates an embodiment that can overcome these problems associated with multiple nip configurations a roll  includes sensing system including a first signal carrying member  serially connecting a first set of sensors  the sensors  are configured to sense an operating parameter eg pressure experienced by the roll  and provide signals related to the operating parameter the first signal carrying member  is arranged in a first helical configuration defined by a first helix angle θ around the roll  the first helix angle θ is defined by an angle between an angular or circumferential position of a first endmost sensor a and an angular or circunferential position of a second endmost sensor b relative to the axis of rotation r of the roll  the sensing system of the roll  also includes a second signal carrying member  spaced apart from the first signal carrying member  the second signal carrying member  serially connects a second set of sensors  the sensors  are configured to sense an operating parameter eg pressure experienced by the roll  and provide signals related to the operating parameter the first signal carrying member  is arranged in a second helical configuration defined by a second helix angle θ around the roll  the second helix angle θ is defined by an angle between an angular or circumferential position of a first endmost sensor a and an angular or circumferential position of a second endmost sensor b relative to the axis of rotation r of the roll  the sensing system of the roll  also includes a signal processing unit or device operatively associated with the first and second signal carrying members   the signal processing unit or device is configured to selectively monitor the signals transmitted by the first signal carrying member  and therefore provided by the first set of sensors  and the signals transmitted by the second signal carrying member  and therefore provided by the second set of sensors  in some embodiments the signal processing unit or device is configured to alternately monitor the signals transmitted by the first signal carrying member  and the signals transmitted by the second signal carrying member  the signal processing unit or device is described in more detail below in the illustrated embodiment the angular spacing between adjacent sensors  of the first sensor set is reduced and the angular spacing between adjacent sensors  of the second sensor set is reduced this configuration may prevent more than one sensor associated with a particular signal carrying member   from being positioned in more than one nip simultaneously furthermore the axial spacing between adjacent sensors  of the first sensor set is increased and the axial spacing between adjacent sensors  of the second sensor set is increased this may prevent more than one sensor associated with a particular signal carrying member   from being positioned in more the same nip simultaneously it is noted that only nine sensors five sensors  of the first sensor set and four sensors  of the second sensor set have been illustrated in figure  to provide clarity it is envisioned that fewer or more sensors could be used for example there may be  sensors  and  sensors  there may also be an equal number of sensors   furthermore it is envisioned that the helix angles θ θ may be less than or greater than as illustrated for example one or both of the helix angles θ θ may be greater than illustrated such that the respective signal carrying members   curve around the roll  more than as illustrated moreover although two sets of sensors and two signal carrying members are described in detail herein and illustrated in figure  it is envisioned that more than two sensor sets could be employed as needed with each sensor set connected by an individual signal carrying member the sensors  and the sensors  can be axially staggered relative to one another to prevent any voids in a roll profile and therefore allow for a comprehensive profile for example the sensors  of the second set can have an axial position midway or approximately midway between the sensors  of the first set in some embodiments the first and second helix angles θ θ may be substantially equal thus the signal carrying members   may be substantially parallel the spacing between the signal carrying members   may vary depending on the helix angles θθ employed in some embodiments the helix angles θ θ do not overlap therefore the sensors  of the first sensor set span a first circumferential portion of the roll  and the sensors  of the second sensor set span a second different circumferential portion of the roll  as described above the roll  may be particularly useful when positioned relative to more than one mating structure to form more than one nip therewith in some embodiments a first mating structure is positioned relative to the industrial roll  to form a first nip therewith and a second mating structure is positioned relative to the industrial roll  to form a second nip therewith the sensing system can be configured such that no more than one sensor  of the first sensor set is positioned in the first nip and the second nip simultaneously and no more than one sensor  of the second sensor set is positioned in the first nip and the second nip simultaneously by way of example and referring to figure  press rolls  and  can be positioned relative to press roll  to form respective nips n n therewith roll  may assume the configuration of roll  illustrated in figure  such that no more than one sensor  is positioned in the nip n and the nip n at the same time and no more than one sensor  is positioned in the nip n and the nip n at the same time by way of further example and referring to figure  calender rolls  and  can be positioned relative to calender roll  to form respective nips n n therewith roll  may assume the configuration of roll  illustrated in figure  such that no more than one sensor  is positioned in the nip n and the nip n at the same time and no more than one sensor  is positioned in the nip n and the nip n at the same time in some embodiments the first and second helix angles θ θ are less than or equal to an angle defined by the first and second nips referring to figure  for example the nip n and the n define an angle β therebetween the angle β is measured relative to the axis of rotation r of roll  which is normal to the page the first and second helix angles θ θ may be less than or equal to the angle β to help ensure that no more than one sensor  of the first sensor set is positioned in the nips n and n simultaneously and no more than one sensor  of the second sensor set is positioned in the nips n and n simultaneously still referring to figure  it is noted that groups of press rolls may include one or more additional rolls such as roll  in this regard press rolls  and  may be positioned relative to press roll  to form respective nips n n therewith roll  may then assume the configuration of roll  illustrated in figure  such that no more than one sensor  is positioned in the nip n and the nip n at the same time and no more than one sensor  is positioned in the nip n and the nip n at the same time the use of more than one sensor array may also be advantageous in that monitoring may continue even if one or more of the arrays stops functioning for example if one of the signal carrying members  illustrated in figure  breaks the sensors connected by the other of the signal carrying members   may still provide signals the same may apply for the signal carrying members   illustrated in figure  turning now to figure  system components for use with the rolls   arc illustrated in particular figure  illustrates how data may flow from the sensors or the signal carrying members to a user as described above the rolls   can include a plurality of signal carrying members eg    n the signal carrying members may be electrically coupled to one or more multiplexers  the one or more multiplexers  may be electrically coupled to a signal conditioning unit  the signal conditioning unit  may transmit conditioned signals representing the measured operating parameter eg pressure to the processor  the link between the signal conditioning unit  and the processor  may be a wireless data transmitter  alternatively the signal conditioning unit  and the processor  may be hardwired the processor  may transmit data to a user interface unit  for example the user interface unit  may include a display a printer and the like the user interface unit  may be configured to present data in a userfriendly manner eg a roll pressure profile may be displayed to the user the processor  may be hardwired to the user interface unit  or data may be transmitted wireressly it is noted that although not shown there may be an amplifier andor an analogtodigital converter after the multiplexers  and before data is stored to memory data may be stored to memory because data may be created faster than it can be wirelessly transmitted for example where used the signal conditioning unit  may include a microprocessor buffer in which data is stored before it is transmitted to the processor  in some embodiments the buffer is partitioned such that a certain amount of space is reserved for each signal carrying member for example if there are two signal carrying members   the buffer may be partitioned such that onehalf or about onehalf of the buffer is reserved for data transmitted from the first signal carrying member  and onehalf or about onehalf of the buffer is reserved for data transmitted from the second signal carrying member  a user may send a command to collect data at the user interface unit  the multiplexer  or a first multiplexers  may be set to receive signals transmitted from the first signal carrying member  and onehalf or about onehalf the buffer may be filled with data from the first signal carrying member  the multiplexer  may then switch or a second multiplexer  may be set to receive signals transmitted from the second signal carrying member  and the remainder of the buffer may be filled with data from the second signal carrying member  at this point all the data may be transmitted to the processor  the data may then be sent to the user interface  in an appropriate format in some other embodiments the buffer can be filled with data from one signal carrying member at a time for example if there are two signal carrying members   upon command from a user the data processor  may first request data from the first signal carrying member  the multiplexer  or a first multiplexer  may be set to receive signals transmitted from the first signal carrying member  and the buffer may be filled with data from the first signal carrying member  the data from the first signal carrying member  may then transmitted to the processor  before providing the data to the user interface  the multiplexer  may then switch or a second multiplexer  may be set to receive signals transmitted from the second signal carrying member  and the buffer may be filled with data from the second signal carrying member  the data from the second signal carrying member  may then transmitted to the data processor  at which point the processor  may combine the two sets of data to create a pressure profile at the user interface  for example as described above the sensing systems of the rolls   include a signal processing unit or device operatively associated with the signal carrying members and configured to selectively monitor the signals transmitted from the signal carrying members or provided by the sensors associated therewith in various embodiments the signal processing unit or device may include one or more of the components illustrated in figure  such as the multiplexers  the signal conditioning unit  the wireless data transmitter  the processor  andor the user interface device  methods of measuring an operating parameter experienced by an industrial roll according to some embodiments of the invention are illustrated in figure  a roll is provided including at least a first signal carrying member serially connecting a first set of sensors and a second signal carrying member serially connecting a second set of sensors block  the roll may take the form of either of rolls   described above in particular the roll can include any of the features described above in reference to rolls   in some embodiments the roll is rotated with a mating structure positioned relative to the roll to form a nip therewith such that no more than one sensor of the first sensor set and no more than one sensor of the second sensor set is positioned in the nip simultaneously block  in some other embodiments the roll is rotated with a first mating structure positioned relative to the roll to form a first nip therewith and with a second mating structure positioned relative to the roll to form a second nip therewith such that no more than one sensor of the

block  in some embodiments the signals from the first sensor set and the signals from the second sensor set can be alternately monitored andor transmitted the data from the first set of sensors and the second set of sensors can be transmitted to create an operating parameter eg pressure profile  previous patent method and device fo      next patent belt assembly and me  home search services
