plaintiff v memorandum opinion pacific gold corp defendant kevin mcnulty usdj the plaintiff black mountain equities inc  black mountain  trades in distressed securities it profits by discerning value that may have been overlooked by others black mountain has purchased at a steep discount a warrant to purchase common stock the yag warrant  it brings this action alleging that pacific gold corp  pacific gold  has refused to deliver  shares of its publicly traded common stock pursuant to the yag warrant the dispute here is over the exercise price under the warrant as of february   if as black mountain contends a certain price adjustment was triggered then the exercise price was approximately a penny actually  per share and the option was in the money because the stock was then trading at a higher price if as pacific gold contends the adjustment was not triggered then the exercise price was much higher the option was out of the money and the yag warrant now expired was essentially worthless according to black mountain the yag warrant s price adjustment mechanism was triggered under a mostfavorednation arrangement when  so called because it was originally issued to cornell capital partners lp which became ya global investments llc  yag  black mountain has purchased the warrant from yag as related below although not a party to the original negotiations black mountain now stands in the shoes of yag  that terminology is the court s not the parties  originally a feature of international trade relations most favored nation has been extended by analogy to the domestic commercial context see bryan a garner ed black s law dictionary  th ed   pacific gold issued shares to another investor crescent international at  per share the mostfavorednation clause if applicable entitled black mountain to exercise the yag warrant at the same price crescent paid pacific gold counters that another relevant agreement specifically the october   letter agreement  provides that the crescent transaction would not trigger the mostfavorednation adjustment because that agreement defines the crescent securities as excluded securities if pacific gold s interpretation is correct then black mountain was not entitled to exercise the yag warrant at the crescent price section  of the october   letter agreement however quickly leads us into an interpretive morass carelessly drafted it does not parse as a proper english sentence and neither party contends that it can mean precisely what it says black mountain says that section  s reference to excluded securities is artifactual a mere scrivener s error and that the court should simply excise the reference pacific gold s interpretation on the other hand requires the court to interpolate the word includes into section  this case seems to pit the brackets against the ellipses at this early stage the matter is before the court on plaintiff s motion for an affirmative preliminary injunction directing pacific gold to deliver  shares of stock to black mountain i have reviewed the parties submissions and i heard oral argument on october   for the reasons set forth below the court is not persuaded that black mountain has met its burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm plaintiff s motion for a preliminary injunction will therefore be denied i background pacific gold a corporation and citizen of the state of nevada owns certain mining claims property and leases in nevada and colorado plaintiff black mountain a california corporation and citizen invests in startup companies and distressed equity opportunities the amount in controversy concededly exceeds  this court has federal subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to  usc §  the diversity statute venue is proper in the district of new jersey under  usc §  because the yag warrant contains a forum selection clause and pacific gold has made no attempt to show that the clause is invalid or unreasonable see cadapult graphic sys inc v tektronix inc  f supp d   dnj  the parties have agreed that new jersey law governs the interpretation of the yag warrant yag warrant § rudders cert ex a ecf no    a the yag warrant pacific gold wanted to raise capital therefore on february   pacific gold entered into a securities purchase agreement by which it sold convertible debentures and a warrant to purchase shares to cornell capital partners lp cornell is now known as ya global investments lp  yag  pursuant to that agreement pacific gold issued the yag warrant to purchase common stock a fiveyear contract that expired on february   under the terms of the yag warrant yag could exercise an option to obtain up to  million shares of pacific gold at a thencurrent exercise price of   per share that exercise price however was subject to adjustment section  of the yag warrant provided that if pacific gold should issue other shares at a lower price then the exercise price under the yag warrant would be adjusted downward to match that mostfavorednation arrangement appears to have been designed to protect yag against dilution of the warrant s value the price adjustment would not be triggered however by the issuance of defined excluded securities thus the yag warrant provides in relevant part if and whenever the company issues or sells or is deemed to have issued or sold any shares of common stock other than excluded securities for a consideration per share less than a price the applicable price  equal to the warrant exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale then immediately after such issue or sale the warrant exercise price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to such consideration per share upon each such adjustment of the warrant exercise price hereunder the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant shall be adjusted to the number of shares determined by multiplying the warrant exercise price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of this warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing the product thereof by the warrant exercise price resulting from such adjustment yag warrant § a emphasis added it is undisputed that a third party crescent international subsequently exercised certain conversion rights and that yag issued common stock to crescent at an average price of  per share pacific gold says that these the yag warrant §  bvi defines excluded securities the defmition more pertinent to the outcome of this case however is contained in the october   letter agreement as discussed below  crescent shares were excluded securities  black mountain says they were not on that issue depends the applicability of the downward price adjustment under the yag warrant a description of the transaction with crescent follows b the crescent transaction and october   letter agreement in october  pacific gold entered into a financing transaction with crescent international the structure of the crescent transaction was similar to that of the earlier yag transaction like the yag transaction the crescent transaction encompassed convertible debentures and a common stock warrant pacific gold s ability to enter this financing transaction with crescent however was contingent upon yag s consent accordingly pacific gold and yag entered into a side letter agreement the october   letter agreement rudders cert ex e ecf no   in the october   letter agreement yag i ii iii consented to the crescent transaction agreed that the conversion price under the crescent debentures of   per share would adjust yag s exercise price under the yag warrant downward to   per share and in section  agreed that the crescent transaction unless the terms were changed in the future would not cause any further adjustment in the conversion rate of the yag debentures the october   letter agreement also contains the defectively drafted section  here reprinted in its entirety the company and ya global agree that for the purposes of the ya global warrant the definition of excluded securities the issuance of shares of common stock on conversion of the crescent debenture and exercise of the crescent warrant upon the terms as originally issued on the date hereof provided the terms are not changed after the date hereof will not  cause any adjustment in the conversion rate of the yag debentures october   letter agreement §  section  is discussed more fully below section  of the october   letter agreement is also relevant to the analysis it provides the parties appear to agree that section  although it refers to yag debentures was intended to encompass the exercise of the yag warrant the reference to yag debentures in section  of the agreement by contrast see paragraph iii immediately above appears to reflect the intent of the parties  for the purposes of this agreement if the crescent debenture conversion rate or the crescent warrant exercise price is adjusted then the exercise shall  be adjusted pursuant to section  price of the yag warrant and the fixed conversion price of the yag debenture if it is not paid in full will be adjusted pursuant to section a of the yag debenture to the extent such adjustment is below the exercise or conversion price of the yag debenture or warrants   id section  the crescent debenture like the yag warrant has a mostfavorednation price adjustment mechanism under section c of the crescent debenture crescent was entitled to a onetimeonly price adjustment based upon the average conversion price under the yag debenture for the last three redemption issuances to yag in the ensuing ten month period landeau cert ¶  ecf no  those last three redemption issuances to yag occurred in july and august  at an average price of  id thus the conversion price under the crescent debenture was likewise adjusted to  id in late  and early  pacific gold issued approximately  shares to crescent at the adjusted price of  per share fleming dec ex  ecf no  c black mountain s exercise notice on february   twelve days before the yag warrant expired black mountain purchased the warrant from yag for  on february   black mountain attempted to exercise the yag warrant at a price of  per share that exercise price was based on the mostfavorednation adjustment in the october   letter agreement in its exercise notice black mountain alluded to the basis for the price the change of the crescent conversion price to  causes an adjustment to the yag warrant exercise price and warrant quantity exercise notice baker deci ex  ecf no  the next day by letter dated february   pacific gold rejected black mountain s attempt to exercise the warrant at  per share in that letter pacific gold stated that the adjusted price for the conversion and pacific gold contends that because of interlocking provisions yag s own conversion price triggered a reduction of the crescent conversion price to  and that black mountain as yag s successor now relies upon that very reduction to trigger a reduction of the yag warrant exercise price whether that is circular or not it does not necessarily bear upon the proper interpretation of the agreements here if the parties contracted for a hail of mirrors then that is what they should get   issuance of shares pursuant to the crescent debenture did not trigger a commensurate price adjustment under the yag warrant hence this action ii legal standard a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish j that he is likely to succeed on the merits  that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief  that the balance of equities tips in his favor and  that an injunction is in the public interest winter v natural res def council inc  us    numbering added accord american express travel related servs inc v sidamoneristoff  fd   d cir  it has often been observed that the purpose of the preliminary injunction is the preservation of the status quo and that an injunction may not issue if it would disturb the status quo  a wright miller  kane federal practice and procedure civil d §  at  d ed  that observation however frequent probably goes too far nevertheless the courts have applied heightened scrutiny to applications for  a preliminary injunction that disturbs the status quo  a preliminary

american express  fd at   specifically black mountain must establish that it was entitled to exercise the yag warrant on february   at  per share and upon that exercise to receive approximately  million shares of pacific gold common stock to resolve that merits inquiry this court must interpret the yag warrant and the october   letter agreement black mountain argues that the clear and unambiguous terms of the yag warrant and october   letter agreement establish that an adjustment to the yag warrant exercise price was triggered when in  pacific gold issued approximately  million shares to crescent pursuant to the crescent debenture at  per share plaintiff s mem at  ecf no  the court agrees that under the mostfavorednation provision of the yag warrant the exercise price will be adjusted if pacific gold issues any shares of common stock for less than a price equal to the yag warrant exercise price id at  further it is undisputed that pacific gold did indeed issue shares of common stock to crescent for less than the yag warrant exercise price        that does not however end the inquiry the court must still consider the october   letter agreement which is far from clear as to section  of the october   letter agreement quoted above black mountain s argument is straightforward section  requires an adjustment to the yag warrant exercise price if the crescent debenture conversion rate is adjusted as noted above the crescent debenture conversion rate was indeed adjusted to  black mountain contends that it is therefore entitled to the same  price that crescent got pacific gold has a narrower interpretation of section  but it depends in part upon the delimitation of section  hence i will first discuss section   pacific gold stresses that what section  of the october   agreement appears to give section  can take away it contends that the shares issued to crescent at  are excluded securities under section   of the october   letter agreement if so says pacific gold then the issuance of those shares to crescent would not trigger the adjustment of the yag warrant exercise price as noted however the drafting of section  quoted in full above is highly flawed as a matter of syntax and grammar black mountain proposes to eliminate the excluded securities issue by arguing that any such language in section  is a remnant from an earlier draft not intended to have any effect plaintiff s reply mem at  ecf no  for this point black mountain relies on the certification of andrew rudders esq a certification by the way filed in opposition to black mountain s motion mr hudders represented pacific gold in both the yag and crescent financing transactions and he speaks from personal knowledge rudders cert ¶j   ecf no  his certification attaches emails and prior drafts of the october   letter agreement that he exchanged with ya global s inhouse counsel david fine esq according to black mountain those emails and drafts by which sections  and  developed into their final form establish that the parties intended to drop the reference to excluded securities from section  plaintiff s reply mem at  ecf no  black mountain itself of course was not involved in the  negotiation it arrived on the scene much later when it purchased the yag warrant in  it does appear that in earlier drafts sections  and  of the october   letter agreement were parallel and that they contained parallel excluded securities language see hudders cert ex g it is also clear that an earlier reference to excluded securities was struck from the final version of section  but black mountain ventures into conjecture when it concludes that the failure also to strike the reference to excluded securities from section  must therefore have been a clerical error to some degree black mountain s contentions depend on david fine s intentions when he was negotiating on behalf of ya global but black mountain does not submit a supporting declaration from mr fine rather black mountain relies on a declaration from troy rillo a senior managing director at yorkville advisors llc which was ya gobal s investment manager ecf no  mr rub states that the language of the october   letter agreement makes crystal clear that any adjustment to the conversion rate of the crescent convertible note or the exercise price of the crescent warrant for whatever reason will result in a corresponding adjustment to the ya global warrant rub deci ¶  ecf no  mr rillo claims to possess personal knowledge regarding ya global s investment in pacific gold and no doubt he does it does not appear however that rillo was specifically involved in the drafting of the october   letter agreement his interpretation of the agreement may represent his sincere opinion pacific gold is skeptical even of this see infra but it is not competent firsthand factual testimony  in short black mountain which has the burden of proof proposes an interpretation of section  that is within the realm of possibility but it does not clearly establish a likelihood of success on the merits to be sure pacific gold s argument that the crescent shares are excluded securities under section  is not free of difficulties either pacific gold makes the awkward proposal that the court salvage section  by inserting the word includes as follows the company and ya global agree that for the purposes of the ya global warrant the definition of excluded securities includes the issuance of shares of common stock on conversion of the crescent debenture and exercise of the crescent warrant upon the terms as originally issued on the date hereof provided the terms are not changed after the date hereof will not cause any adjustment in the conversion rate of the yag debentures the subject of the alleged sentence  definition  is now paired with a verb  includes  and that represents a grammatical improvement pacific gold s particular word choice however is not dictated by grammar why interpolate includes if for example does not include makes just as much syntactical sense the answer says pacific gold is in the negotiation history of the october   letter agreement in cases of ambiguity a court applying new jersey law may look to extrinsic evidence as an aid to interpretation chubb custom ins co v prudential ins co of am  nj   ad    indeed even when an agreement is integrated and seemingly clear evidence of the circumstances is admissible in aid of interpretation conway v  corporate ctr assocs  nj   ad    this is so even when the contract on its face is free from ambiguity the polestar of construction is the intention of the parties to the contract as revealed by the language used taken as an entirety and in the quest for the intention the situation of the parties the attendant circumstances and the objects they were thereby striving to attain are necessarily to be regarded the admission of evidence of extrinsic facts is not for the purpose of changing the writing but to secure light by which to measure its actual significance  ati n airlines inc v schwimmer  nj   ad    a fortiori when both parties acknowledge that the writing must be reformed or reinterpreted it is permissible to examine their expectations as expressed in the negotiations the first draft of the october   agreement provided that the definition of excluded securities will include hereafter shares of common stock of the company issued or to be issued on conversion of the crescent debenture and exercise of the crescent warrant upon the terms as originally  issued on the date hereof rudders cert ex l david fine inhouse for yag reviewed and revised that draft fine s initial revisions left counsel intact the reference to excluded securities in sections  and  but added the following language to the end provided the terms are not changed after the date hereof id ex g according to pacific gold those emailed revisions demonstrate that fine and therefore yag never intended to disturb section  s definition of excluded shares which includes shares issued under the crescent debenture upon the terms as originally issued on the date hereof less than  hours later david fine sent an email expressing second thoughts about sections  and  id ex h that email expressed a concern that there can be an event that may not be captured by our antidilution sections but trigger an adjustment under crescents i think it is fair that we both be treated the same going forward id according to pacific gold fine was here conveying his belief that section  adequately covered the existing situation but that he remained concerned with the unpredictable an event that may not be captured by the current language the relationship going forward pacific gold argues that mr fine therefore inserted additional language into sections  and  to allow for the possibility of any new adjustments that might arise or be negotiated in the future after an additional exchange of emails at  pm on october   fine circulated a revised draft that for the first time inserted section  id ex i id this says pacific gold was part and parcel of fine s concern with new adjustments ie adjustments not pursuant to the documents in their current form black mountain argues that even assuming that the excluded securities reference in section  was not just a drafting mistake the sweeping as quoted by hudders the draft contains some questionbegging ellipses why elide hereafter for example and what did hereafter mean anyway this draft is redlined to highlight changes confusingly however significant intervening changes to section  do not appear in the redline highlighting the final clause  will not cause any adjustment in the conversion rate of the yag debentures  for example appears for the first time in this draft without explanation   language of section  would nullify it but pacific gold s approach offers a way of reading section  in conjunction with not as a nullification of section  defendant s

surplusage or without effect  porreca v city of miliville  nj super    ad   app div  contract should be read as a whole and should not be interpreted to render one of its terms meaningless  accepting arguendo pacific gold s reading of section  there would appear to be a neat division of labor between sections  and  section  establishes that shares subsequently issued pursuant to the unchanged terms of the crescent debenture and warrant as those terms existed as of october   are excluded securities under the yag warrant id that is section  applies to adjustments upon the terms as originally issued on the date hereof provided the terms are not changed after the date hereof emphasis added section  on the other hand applies if and when the terms of the crescent transaction are changed in the future put another way section  s application is limited to any subsequently negotiated adjustments to the crescent conversion price it must be said that pacific gold s limitation of the scope of section  is not explicit in the text and pacific gold s position like that of black mountain depends on a disputed interpretation of section  only if pacific gold s interpretation of section  is correct does its complementary interpretation of section  make sense as the other side of the coin in short pacific gold s argument regarding the interpretation of sections  and  is plausible but hardly watertight of course it is not pacific gold that seeks a preliminary injunction and pacific gold does not have the burden of proof the court is presented with competing certifications submitted by the parties who did not seek an evidentiary hearing under either side s interpretation it is clear that a drafting error occurred and that additional facts and perhaps additional discovery will be necessary to establish the intent of the contracting parties in this respect black mountain is at a practical disadvantage because it is yag s not black mountain s contractual intent that is relevant on that score pacific gold proffers some powerful circumstantial evidence that black mountain would have to overcome  for example the parties performance sheds light on how they themselves believed the contract should be interpreted restatement second of contracts §  see langer v monarch life ins co  fd   d cir  when writing is ambiguous course of performance is relevant to determination of parties intent state troopers fraternal ass n of nj inc v state  nj   ad    citation omitted court reforms contract based on party s continuing practice of making retroactive pay adjustments not explicitly provided for in agreement rod v gidley  wl  at  nj super ct app div  not precedential  where a course of performance is inconsistent with the language of the agreement which one party claims to be erroneous a court may look to the course of performance to determine the parties intent and understanding and construe and reform the agreement to accord with the course of performance  black mountain seeks to assert rights for which yag allegedly bargained but yag itself before selling the warrant to black mountain exercised the warrant on numerous occasions and never sought an adjustment based on the  crescent price landau cert ¶   ex b ecf no  approximately monthly from june  until september  yag exercised its conversion rights under its debenture to acquire millions of shares of pacific gold stock at prices ranging from   down to  surely at some point yag would have asserted its rights if it believed the yag warrant was in the money at a price of  moreover in february  yag sold its warrant to black mountain for a mere  if black mountain s interpretation is  that section of the restatement provides     where an agreement involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection is given great weight in the interpretation of the agreement  wherever reasonable the manifestations of intention of the parties to a promise or agreement are interpreted as consistent with each other and with any relevant course of performance course of dealing or usage of trade black mountain presses an inference that because pacific gold did not make sec filings in the relevant period yag did not know that crescent had exercised its conversion rights at  that inference is hardly inescapable yag knew for example of the terms of the crescent transaction and if black mountain s interpretation of the october   agreement is correct then yag possessed a vital interest in finding out whether and at what price crescent had exercised its conversion rights  correct the option was then worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that yag which negotiated the terms of the warrant was willing to sell it at such an extraordinary discount suggests that yag did not believe or intend that the option was exercisable for  indeed emails suggest that just before the sale yag specifically warned black mountain that the warrant was out of the money kaplan cert ex d ecf no  just a few hours prior to the closing of the warrant purchase agreement between black mountain and yag tony rillo of yag told adam baker president of black mountain that yag first needed to evaluate the warrant to determine if it was in the money before agreeing to sell it id a few hours later rub advised baker that the adjustment mechanism in the warrants is not applicable id this is the same tony rub whose certification submitted by black mountain now states that it is crystal clear that the yag warrant adjusted to  and was in the money rub s initial position may be explained away as riskshifting to the buyer nevertheless it substantially undercuts his subsequent position it is a factintensive inquiry whether the crescent issuance at  per share fell within the definition of excluded securities or whether on the contrary it triggered a price adjustment under the yag warrant on this record the court cannot conclude that black mountain has demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits see l y ex rel j y v bayonne bd of educ civ a  src  wl  dnj sept   affd  f appx  d cir  denying preliminary injunction based on factintensive merits inquiry where plaintiff failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits for this reason alone i would deny a preliminary injunction  irreparable harm in addition and in the alternative black mountain has failed to demonstrate that it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction does not issue harm is considered irreparable if it is not redressable by money damages at a later date in the ordinary course of litigation instant air freight co v cf air freight inc  fd   d cir  citing sampson v murray  us    economic loss does not constitute irreparable harm in order to warrant a preliminary injunction the injury created by a failure to issue the requested injunction must be of a peculiar nature so that compensation in money cannot atone for ao smith corp v ftc  fd   d cir  quoting gause v perkins  jones eq   am dec   the word irreparable connotes that which cannot be repaired retrieved put down again atoned for id quoting gause  jones eq   am dec     aciemo  fd at  in a contract action it therefore naturally follows that irreparability is closely tied to the question of whether the plaintiff is confined to the legal remedy of damages or may instead be entitled to the equitable remedy of specific performance black mountain does not dispute that specific performance is generally not available in a suit for the delivery of shares of a publicly traded stock see buford v wilmington trust co  fd   d cir  specific performance inappropriate in action for failure to deliver shares of publicly traded stock where the shares do not carry with them unique characteristics such as corporate control lucente v int l bus mach corp  fd   d cir  finding simply no reason why assuming a jury finds ibm liable for breach of contract money damages would not adequately compensate plaintiff for ibm s breach of contract to deliver publiclytraded shares upon exercise of stock option citing simon v electrospace corp  ned   ny  noting that specific performance is not appropriate where the claim involves publicly traded stock dimock v us nat bank  njl   ea  rather damages are an adequate and appropriate remedy for failure to deliver shares that are available on the open market see generally a fletcher cyc corp §   if the seller of stock refuses or fails to perform in accordance with the contract the purchaser may maintain an action for damages against that person with whom the contract was made  this action is about money by definition damages would make plaintiff whole if it prevailed black mountain makes a distinct claim however it alleges that preliminary injunctive relief is necessary to preserve any damages remedy to which it may ultimately be entitled the irreparable harm according to black mountain is that pacific gold is or may become insolvent rendering a money judgment uncollectable plaintiff s mem at  ecf no   black mountain will suffer irreparable harm because pcfg is unlikely to be able to satisfy any ultimate damages award at the end of the case  the supreme court s decision in grupo mexicano cle desarrollo sa v alliance bond fund inc  us   while not precisely on point suggests that preliminary injunctive relief would be inappropriate there plaintiffs had sought a preliminary injunction restraining grupo mexicano from transferring assets plaintiffs alleged that grupo mexicano was at risk of insolvency or already insolvent that it was planning preferential transfers of  its most valuable assets to its mexican creditors and that these actions would frustrate any judgment plaintiffs could obtain id at  the supreme court held that a plaintiff who sued for breach of contract seeking damages a remedy at law could not obtain a preliminary injunction against the assets of a debtor against whom it had no judgment id at  to be sure grupo mexicano makes it clear that when a plaintiff asserts equitable claims as opposed to legal claims for damages the rule barring issuance of a preliminary injunction freezing assets does not apply see id at   distinguishing deckert v independence shares corp  us   and noting that in deckert the preliminary injunction was a reasonable measure to preserve the status quo pending a final determination of the questions raised by the equitable bill  grupo mexicano does not prohibit the issuance of preliminary injunctions in an action for equitable relief this action however is not properly viewed as one in equity true black mountain seeks to compel delivery of shares nevertheless even if black mountain prevailed on its breach of contract claim its sole remedy would be money damages not specific performance see supra in this case then a preliminary injunction is not required to preserve the court s ability to award final equitable relief because no such relief would be appropriate see ortho pharm corp v amgen inc  fd    d cir   the most compelling reason in favor of  issuing a preliminary injunction is the need to prevent the judicial process from being rendered futile by defendant s action or refusal to act    consequently the preliminary injunction is appropriate whenever the policy of preserving the court s power to decide the case effectively outweighs the risk of imposing an interim restraint before it has done so  quoting wright  miller federal practice and procedure §  at   black mountain s preliminary injunction motion although couched in equitable terms is more properly viewed as an attempt to secure a money judgment to which it may someday be entitled the shares at issue are not unique in kind quality or personal association they are not the stuff of a decree in equity compare eg us v jenkins  f supp d  sd ga  harming native american artifacts constitutes an irreparable injury for purposes of determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction artifacts are by their nature unique and their historical and cultural significance make them difficult to value monetarily universal engraving inc v duarte  f supp d   d kan  no amount of monetary damages could restore the confidentiality of proprietary information and the harm from  disclosure of trade secrets would be irreparable beerheide v zavaras  f supp   d cob  orthodox jewish prisoners seeking an injunction to compel a prison to serve them kosher food satisfied the irreparable injury requirement because damages would not compensate them or remedy the deprivation of their free exercise rights the only harm black mountain alleges is that assets might not be available to satisfy what must as a matter of law be a money judgment and no more if concern for a defendant s solvency were sufficient grounds for an injunction it is difficult to see why a plaintiff in any action for a personal judgment in tort or contract may not also apply to the chancellor for a socalled injunction sequestrating his opponent s assets pending recovery and satisfaction of a judgment in such a law action no relief of this character has been thought justified in the long history of equity jurisprudence grupo mexicano  us at  quoting de beers consol mines v united states  us    black mountain cites unreported new york federal cases that awarded relief like that sought by black mountain here see eg alpha capital anstat v advanced cell technology inc sdny  civ  lak sdny feb   alpha capital anstat v advanced cell technology inc sdny  civ  pac sdny oct   alpha capital aktiengesellschaft v advanced viral research no  cv  gbd  wl  at  sdny feb   longview special finance v infinium labs inc  civ  rjh nov   castle creek technology partners llc v ceilpoint inc no  civ  gel  wl  at  sdny dec   a number of these cases were decided before grupo mexicano and none of them mention grupo mexicano black mountain also relies on a pre grupo mexicano case from the third circuit hoxworth v blinder robinson  co  fd   d cir  for the proposition that a preliminary injunction can be authorized in extraordinary circumstances to secure a money judgment where defendant would be insolvent hoxworth is distinguishable because it involved a defendant who was dissipating or secreting assets an equitable concern not present here id at  more fundamentally though hoxworth must be applied with caution in light of the subsequent grupo mexicano decision see generally us v tann  fd   d cir   we should not countenance the continued application in this circuit of a rule even of our own devising which is patently inconsistent with the supreme court s pronouncements  quoting cox v dravo corp  fd   d cir  in fact the second circuit decision reversed by  grupo mexicano relied on hoxworth in the same manner that black mountain does here see alliance bond fund inc v grupo mexicano de desarrollo sa  fd   d cir  citing hoxworth for the proposition that a preliminary injunction is available to protect the plaintiffs right to recover monetary damages when there is a threat that the defendant will become insolvent or dissipate assets  the supreme court reversing expressly disagreed with the second circuit on that very point grupo mexicano  us at  in light of grupo mexicano the court is not persuaded by the cases cited by pacific gold ° no preliminary injunction may issue where a plaintiff has failed to demonstrate likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm morton v beyer  fd   d cir  holding that the absence of both or either is fatal to a motion for preliminary injunction accord american express travel related servs  fd at  applicant must show both a likelihood of success and irreparable injury thus the court will refrain from examining the remaining factors ie the balance of harms and the public interest the extraordinary and limited remedy of a preliminary injunction is not warranted  even if i were to accept that the prospect of a defendant s insolvency may constitute irreparable harm i would not necessarily find that the requisite showing has been made here the supreme court has stressed that a plaintiff seeking preliminary relief must demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction winter  us at  emphasis in original see also nissen v rozsa  wl  dnj aug    speculation as to unsatisfiability of the judgment or potential dissipation of assets in the absence of any facts supporting such a claim is insufficient to meet its burden to demonstrate irreparable harm  citing grupo mexicano  us at  black mountain asserts that pacific gold is insolvent because pacific gold s most recent balance sheet lists assets totaling  and liabilities of  fleming deci ex  at f p  of  ecf no  pacific gold counters that its balance sheet does not capture its true financial position because it reflects only the historical cost of assets less depreciation not a current fair market valuation defendant s mem at  ecf no  a judgment for plaintiff while substantial is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars see baker deci ¶  ecf no stating that the  million shares of pacific gold had a market value far in excess of  at the time of black mountain s exercise notice black mountain s claim that pacific gold lacks the cash or assets to satisfy such a judgment is at best in need of further factual development  iv conclusion for the foregoing reasons the motion of the plaintiff black mountain equities inc for a preliminary injunction will be denied an appropriate form of order will be filed m j
