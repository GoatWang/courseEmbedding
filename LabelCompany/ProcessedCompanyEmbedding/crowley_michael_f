julyÂ   carbohydrate polymers full text available efficient estimation of the maximum metabolic productivity of batch systems st john peter c  crowley michael f  bomble yannick j januaryÂ   biotechnology for biofuels production of chemicals from engineered organisms in a batch culture involves an inherent tradeoff between productivity yield and titer existing strategies for strain design typically focus on designing mutations that achieve the highest yield possible while maintaining growth viability while these methods are computationally tractable an optimum productivity could be achieved by a dynamic strategy in which the intracellular division of resources is permitted to change with time new methods for the design and implementation of dynamic microbial processes both computational and experimental have therefore been explored to maximize productivity however solving for the optimal metabolic behavior under the assumptionmoreÂ Â» that all fluxes in the cell are free to vary is a challenging numerical task here previous studies have therefore typically focused on simpler strategies that are more feasible to implement in practice such as the timedependent control of a single flux or control variableÂ«Â less full text available coupling and reactions of hydroxyconiferyl alcohol in lignin formation elder thomas  berstis laura  beckham gregg t   mayÂ   journal of agricultural and food chemistry the catechol alcohols caffeyl and hydroxyconiferyl alcohol may be incorporated into lignin either naturally or through genetic manipulation due to the presence of ooh groups these compounds form benzodioxanes a departure from the interunit connections found in lignins derived from the cinnamyl alcohols in nature lignins composed of caffeyl and hydroxyconiferyl alcohol are linear homopolymers and as such may have properties that make them amenable for use in valueadded products such as ligninbased carbon fibers in the current work results from density functional theory calculations for the reactions of hydroxyconiferyl alcohol taking stereochemistry into account are reported dehydrogenation and quinone methide formation are found to be thermodynamically favored for hydroxyconiferyl alcohol over coniferyl alcohol the comparative energetics of the rearomatization reactions suggest that the formation of the benzodioxane linkage is under kinetic control ringopening reactions of the benzodioxane groups show that the bond dissociation enthalpy of themoreÂ Â» alphao cleavage reaction is lower than that of the betao reaction in conclusion the catechol lignins represent a novel form of the polymer that may offer new opportunities for bioproducts and genetic targetsÂ«Â less full text available simulations of cellulose translocation in the bacterial cellulose synthase suggest a regulatory mechanism for the dimeric structure of cellulose knott brandon c  crowley michael f  himmel michael e   januaryÂ   chemical science the processive cycle of the bacterial cellulose synthase bcs includes the addition of a single glucose moiety to the end of a growing cellulose chain followed by the translocation of the nascent chain across the plasma membrane the mechanism of this translocation and its precise location within the processive cycle are not well understood in particular the molecular details of how a polymer cellulose whose basic structural unit is a dimer cellobiose can be constructed by adding one monomer glucose at a time are yet to be elucidated here we have utilized molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations tomoreÂ Â» the shed light on these questions we find that translocation forward by one glucose unit is quite favorable energetically giving a free energy stabilization of greater than  kcal mol in addition there is only a small barrier to translocation implying that translocation is not rate limiting within the bcs processive cycle given experimental rates for cellulose synthesis in vitro perhaps most significantly our results also indicate that steric constraints at the transmembrane tunnel entrance regulate the dimeric structure of cellulose namely when a glucose molecule is added to the cellulose chain in the same orientation as the acceptor glucose the terminal glucose freely rotates upon forward motion thus suggesting a regulatory mechanism for the dimeric structure of cellulose we characterize both the conserved and nonconserved enzymepolysaccharide interactions that drive translocation and find that  of the  residues that strongly interact with the translocating cellulose chain in the simulations are well conserved mostly with polar or aromatic side chains our results also allow for a dynamical analysis of the role of the socalled finger helix in cellulose translocation that has been observed structurally taken together these findings aid in the elucidation of the translocation steps of the bcs processive cycle and may be widely relevant to polysaccharide synthesizing or degrading enzymes that couple catalysis with chain translocationÂ«Â less cited by full text available whos on base revealing the catalytic mechanism of inverting family  glycoside hydrolases mayes heather b  knott brandon c  crowley michael f   juneÂ   chemical science in several important classes of inverting carbohydrateactive enzymes the identity of the catalytic base remains elusive including in family  glycoside hydrolase gh enzymes which are key components of cellulase cocktails for cellulose depolymerization despite many structural and kinetic studies with both wildtype and mutant enzymes especially on the trichoderma reesei hypocrea jecorina gh cellulase trcela the catalytic base in the single displacement inverting mechanism has not been definitively identified in the gh family here we employ transition path sampling to gain insight into the catalytic mechanism which provides unbiased atomiclevel understanding of key order parameters involved in cleaving themoreÂ Â» strong glycosidic bond our hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics qmmm simulations reveal a network of hydrogen bonding that aligns two active site water molecules that play key roles in hydrolysis one water molecule drives the reaction by nucleophilic attack on the substrate and a second shuttles a proton to the putative base d via a short water wire we also investigated the case where the putative base is mutated to an alanine an enzyme that is experimentally still partially active the simulations predict that proton hopping along a water wire via a grotthuss mechanism provides a mechanism of catalytic rescue further simulations reveal that substrate processive motion is driven by strong electrostatic interactions with the protein at the product sites and that the  sugar adopts a so ring configuration as it reaches its binding site lastly this work thus elucidates previously elusive steps in the processive catalytic mechanism of this important class of enzymesÂ«Â less full text available comparing residue clusters from thermophilic and mesophilic enzymes reveals adaptive mechanisms sammond deanne w  kastelowitz noah  himmel michael e   januaryÂ   plos one understanding how proteins adapt to function at high temperatures is important for deciphering the energetics that dictate protein stability and folding while multiple principles important for thermostability have been identified we lack a unified understanding of how internal protein structural and chemical environment determine qualitative or quantitative impact of evolutionary mutations in this work we compare equivalent clusters of spatially neighboring residues between paired thermophilic and mesophilic homologues to evaluate adaptations under the selective pressure of high temperature we find the residue clusters in thermophilic enzymes generally display improved atomic packing compared to mesophilic enzymes in agreement with previous researchmoreÂ Â» unlike residue clusters from mesophilic enzymes however thermophilic residue clusters do not have significant cavities in addition anchor residues found in many clusters are highly conserved with respect to atomic packing between both thermophilic and mesophilic enzymes as a result the improvements in atomic packing observed in thermophilic homologues are not derived from these anchor residues but from neighboring positions which may serve to expand optimized protein core regionsÂ«Â less cited by full text available strategies to reduce endproduct inhibition in family  glycoside hydrolases chen mo  bu lintao  alahuhta markus   februaryÂ   proteins family  cellobiohydrolases are some of the most abundant glycoside hydrolases in nature they are able to degrade cellulosic biomass and therefore serve as good enzyme candidates for biofuel production family  cellulases hydrolyze cellulose chains via a processive mechanism and produce end products composed primarily of cellobiose as well as other cellooligomers dp â‰¤  the challenge of utilizing cellulases in biofuel production lies in their extremely slow turnover rate a factor contributing to the low enzyme activity is suggested to be product binding to enzyme and the resulting performance inhibition in this study we quantitatively evaluated the productmoreÂ Â» inhibitory effect of four family  glycoside hydrolases using molecular dynamics simulations and product expulsion freeenergy calculations we also suggested a series of single mutants of the four family  glycoside hydrolases with theoretically reduced level of product inhibition as a result the theoretical calculations provide a guide for future experimental studies designed to produce mutant

elisabeth   decemberÂ   biotechnology for biofuels background nonspecific binding of cellulases to lignin has been implicated as a major factor in the loss of cellulase activity during biomass conversion to sugars it is believed that this binding may strongly impact process economics through loss of enzyme activities during hydrolysis and enzyme recycling scenarios the current model suggests glycoside hydrolase activities are lost though nonspecificnonproductive binding of carbohydratebinding domains to lignin limiting catalytic site access to the carbohydrate components of the cell wall results in this study we compared component enzyme affinities of a commercial trichoderma reesei cellulase formulation cellic ctec towards extracted corn stover lignin usingmoreÂ Â» sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and pnitrophenyl substrate activities to monitor component binding activity loss and total protein binding protein binding was strongly affected by ph and ionic strength Î²dglucosidases and xylanases which do not have carbohydratebinding modules cbms and are basic proteins demonstrated the strongest binding at low ionic strength suggesting that cbms are not the dominant factor in enzyme adsorption to lignin despite strong adsorption to insoluble lignin Î²dglucosidase and xylanase activities remained high with process yields decreasing only â€“  depending on lignin concentration conclusion we propose that specific enzyme adsorption to lignin from a mixture of biomasshydrolyzing enzymes is a competitive affinity where Î²dglucosidases and xylanases can displace cbm interactions with lignin process parameters such as temperature ph and salt concentration influence the individual enzymesâ€™ affinity for lignin and both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions are responsible for this binding phenomenon moreover our results suggest that concern regarding loss of critical cell wall degrading enzymes to lignin adsorption may be unwarranted when complex enzyme mixtures are used to digest biomassÂ«Â less cited by full text available Â« prev select page number go to page  of  Â» next Â» cited by information provided by web of
