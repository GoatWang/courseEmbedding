as well as regional us carriers such as ontrac eastern connection and lso formerly known as lonestar overnight in addition to these domestic carriers ups competes with a variety of international operators including canada post and its subsidiary purolator transforce deutsche post and its subsidiary dhl royal mail japan post india post and many other regional carriers national postal services and air cargo handlers see package delivery and mail pages historically the bulk of ups competition came from inexpensive groundbased delivery services such as parcel post usps or choice logistics but in  fedex expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring rps originally roadway package system and rebranding it as fedex ground in  in  dhl expanded its us operations by acquiring airborne express significantly increasing its presence in the united states and adding more competition in the ground delivery market in response to this ups partnered with the us postal service to offer ups mail innovations a program that allows ups to pick up mail  packages separately from the main ground network and transfer them to a usps center or destination delivery unit ddu for final distribution this process is also known as zone skipping long used by parcel consolidators ups also has a separate product called surepost which uses the ups ground network to deliver packages to the nearest ups package center which transfers them to the usps ddu for final mile delivery more recently the continued growth of online shopping combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation including package delivery has on the environment has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents for instance the us postal service claims greener delivery of parcels on the assumption that usps letter carriers deliver to each us address six days a week anyway and therefore offer the industrys lowest fuel consumption per delivery other carriers like parcelpoolcom which specializes in residential package delivery to apofpo addresses hawaii alaska puerto rico and other us territories arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online etailers for lowcost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery transportationedit

operators including canada post and its subsidiary purolator transforce deutsche post and its subsidiary dhl royal mail japan post india post and many other regional carriers national postal services and air cargo handlers see package delivery and mail pages historically the bulk of ups competition came from inexpensive groundbased delivery services such as parcel post usps or choice logistics but in  fedex expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring rps originally roadway package system and rebranding it as fedex ground in  in  dhl expanded its us operations by acquiring airborne express significantly increasing its presence in the united states and adding more competition in the ground delivery market in response to this ups partnered with the us postal service to offer ups mail innovations a program that allows ups to pick up mail  packages separately from the main ground network and transfer them to a usps center or destination delivery unit ddu for final distribution this process is also known as zone skipping long used by parcel consolidators ups also has a separate product called surepost which uses the ups ground network to deliver packages to the nearest ups package center which transfers them to the usps ddu for final mile delivery more recently the continued growth of online shopping combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation including package delivery has on the environment has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents for instance the us postal service claims greener delivery of parcels on the assumption that usps letter carriers deliver to each us address six days a week anyway and therefore offer the industrys lowest fuel consumption per delivery other carriers like parcelpoolcom which specializes in residential package delivery to apofpo addresses hawaii alaska puerto rico and other us territories arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online etailers for lowcost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery transportationedit

and air cargo handlers see package delivery and mail pages historically the bulk of ups competition came from inexpensive groundbased delivery services such as parcel post usps or choice logistics but in  fedex expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring rps originally roadway package system and rebranding it as fedex ground in  in  dhl expanded its us operations by acquiring airborne express significantly increasing its presence in the united states and adding more competition in the ground delivery market in response to this ups partnered with the us postal service to offer ups mail innovations a program that allows ups to pick up mail  packages separately from the main ground network and transfer them to a usps center or destination delivery unit ddu for final

as well as regional us carriers such as ontrac eastern connection and lso formerly known as lonestar overnight in addition to these domestic carriers ups competes with a variety of international operators including canada post and its subsidiary purolator transforce deutsche post and its subsidiary dhl royal mail japan post india post and many other regional carriers national postal services and air cargo handlers see package delivery and mail pages historically the bulk of ups competition came from inexpensive groundbased delivery services such as parcel post usps or choice logistics but in  fedex expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring rps originally roadway package system and rebranding it as fedex ground in  in  dhl expanded its us operations by acquiring airborne express significantly increasing its presence in the united states and adding more competition in the ground delivery market in response to this ups partnered with the us postal service to offer ups mail innovations a program that allows ups to pick up mail  packages separately from the main ground network and transfer them to a usps center or destination delivery unit ddu for final distribution this process is also known as zone skipping long used by parcel consolidators ups also has a separate product called surepost which uses the ups ground network to deliver packages to the nearest ups package center which transfers them to the usps ddu for final mile delivery more recently the continued growth of online shopping combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation including package delivery has on the environment has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents for instance the us postal service claims greener delivery of parcels on the assumption that usps letter carriers deliver to each us address six days a week anyway and therefore offer the industrys lowest fuel consumption per delivery other carriers like parcelpoolcom which specializes in residential package delivery to apofpo addresses hawaii alaska puerto rico and other us territories arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online etailers for lowcost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery transportationedit

united parcel service inc known in the industry as big brown united parcel service inc ups is the worlds largest package delivery company the atlantabased business delivered approximately  billion items throughout more than  countries and territories in  in addition to its fleet of  vehicles the company operates the ninth largest airline in north america by virtue of its nearly  companyowned and chartered aircraft although upss global reach has been steadily expanding it is the firms us operations that are its most impressive asset its doortodoor delivery system reaches every residential and business address in the country and ups estimates that its system carries goods that are valued at more than  percent of the us gross domestic product more than  percent of upss revenues is generated in the united states where the firm has a market share of about  percent in ground shipping and about  percent in air shipping although ups sold a  percent stake in the company to the public in november  through newly created class b shares the class a shares which control  percent of the voting rights in the company remain in private hands mostly those of employees and retirees roots in the early th century ups was founded in  in seattle washington by yearold jim casey as a sixbicycle messenger service called american messenger company he set the future tone of the company by mandating that it be employeeowned casey delivered telegraph messages and hot lunches and sometimes took odd jobs to keep his struggling business going in  casey merged his company with evert mccabes rival firm motorcycle delivery company creating merchants parcel delivery the fleet at this point consisted of a few motorcycles and one model t ford in  by which time the fleet had expanded to four cars and five motorcycles the company began painting its delivery vehicles brown it was charlie soderstrom one of caseys partners who urged that brown be adopted noting that the color hid dirt wella fact that had earlier led the pullman company to paint its railroad cars that same hue with caseys tacit approval company drivers joined the international brotherhood of teamsters in  in  three seattle department stores hired the service to deliver merchandise to purchasers on the day of the purchase department store deliveries remained the center of the firms business until the late s in  meantime merchants parcel delivery made its first move outside its home market buying a delivery firm in oakland california because there was a similarly named firm already operating in san francisco another name change was in order the moniker chosen was united parcel service during the s ups expanded to los angeles san francisco san diego and portland oregon an expansion drive on the east coast began in  with the start of delivery service in new york city ups moved its headquarters to new york that same year in  ups began air delivery through a new division united air express which put packages on to passenger planes the great depression ended plans for an overnight air service and ups terminated united air express in  the company did not resume air service until  when ups air was launched as a twoday service connecting major cities on the east and west coasts in the late s the urban department stores that ups serviced began following their clients to the new suburbs more people owned cars and picked up their own parcels upss revenue declined casey decided to change direction and expand the commoncarrier parcel business picking up parcels from anyone and taking them to anyone else charging a fixed rate per parcel the companys initial customers were primarily industrial and commercial shippers although the firm also serviced consumers the company had offered commoncarrier service in los angeles since  and in  ups extended it to san francisco chicago and new york ups delivered any package meeting weight and size requirements to any location within  miles of these bases after this initial expansion ups frequently appeared before the interstate commerce commission icc to expand its operating rights ups scaled its operations to fit its market niche refusing packages weighing more than  pounds or with a combined length and width of more than  inches limitations that would increase in concert with the companys capabilities its average package weighed about ten pounds and was roughly the size of a briefcase making sorting and carrying easy ups competed with scores of regional firms but most had not limited the size and weight of their packages they ended up with the heavier packages higher overheads and lower volumes a new generation of leadership for the s casey resigned as chief executive officer in  when ups achieved annual revenues of about  million he was succeeded by george d smith ups more than doubled its sales and profits between  and  when the company made  million on sales of about  million the company remained privately owned its stock held by several hundred of its executives ups in  served  states on the east and west coasts it had just gotten icc approval to add nine midwestern states and soon got approval for three more states only the lightly populated states of arizona alaska hawaii idaho montana nevada and utah were without ups service the firm kept a low profile avoiding publicity and refusing interviews of its chief executives ups officials believed only one parcel shipping company could exist in the united states and it hoped that keeping a low profile would prevent anyone from copying its methods the firms secrecy policy was possible because it was closely held its  stockholders a number raised to  by  were its own top and middle managers and their families stockholders wanting to sell sold their stock back to the company because management owned ups the company could make longrange plans without the pressure for instant profits faced by many publicly owned firms most managers started as ups drivers or sorters and came up through the ranks creating great loyalty the companys management structure was relatively informal stressing partnership and the involvement of management at all levels in  congress considered a reform of the united states postal service that would allow it to subsidize its parcel post operations with profits from its firstclass mail this would allow it to lower prices and compete more directly with ups ups hired a public relations firm and for the first time officially announced its earnings trying to build a case that it was an integral part of the us economy and that the postal reform would be disruptive ups handled  million packages in  for  regular customers the company claimed that  percent of all deliveries within  miles were delivered overnight the company centered operations around a fivedayaweek cycle drivers made deliveries in the morning made pickups in the afternoon and returned to operations centers around  pm their packages were immediately sorted and transferred for delivery ups trucks which were cleaned every night were assigned to specific drivers who the company treated as future managers and owners the company had  drivers in  and most were kept on the same route to develop a relationship with customers some drivers however found ups management inflexible resulting in occasional local strikes in  ups tried to replace gradually all of its fulltime employees who sorted and handled packages at warehouses with parttime workers teamsters locals in the south midwest and west accepted the idea but  ups employees from maine to south carolina went on strike the strike caused chaos for east coast retailers as their suppliers were forced to send christmas goods through the overburdened us postal service ups eventually reached agreement with the teamsters but its labor relations continued to be spotty because management owned the business it tended to drive its employees hard and many drivers complained of the long hours and hard work to maximize driver performance the company kept records of the production of every driver and sorter and compared them to its performance projections drivers routes were timed in great detail in  meantime ups achieved a long coveted goal when it became the first package delivery firm to serve every address in the continental united states that same year the company expanded outside the country for the first time launching delivery service in ontario canada and also relocated its headquarters to connecticut in  ups launched service in west germany with  delivery vans it quickly ran into trouble because of cultural and language differences ups eventually adapted by hiring some german managers and accepting the german dislike of working overtime george c lamb jr succeeded harold oberkotter as ups chairman in  intensifying competition in the s ups continued to grow rapidly aided by trucking deregulation in  by  ups earned  million on revenues of  billion shipping  billion packages federal express corporation fedex however which began operations in  was siphoning off a growing amount of upss business fedex shipped packages overnight by air and many businesses began shipping highpriority packages with fedex ups had the resources to challenge fedex but it meant taking on significant debt something the conservatively run ups was reluctant to do in  it had only  million in longterm debt and a net worth of  million to compete with fedex ups bought nine used  airplanes in  from braniff airlines for  million it opened an air hub in louisville kentucky but was hesitant about directly challenging fedex because of the huge cost of building an air fleet it decided to stick with twoday delivery rather than overnight delivery hoping that many businesses would be willing to let packages take an extra day if it meant savings of up to  percent it called its twoday delivery blue label air and spent  million in  to promote ita large sum for ups which had rarely advertised in  ups ran its firstever television ads trying to convince executives that twoday service was fast enough for most packages the recession of the early s helped ups because many companies shifted to smaller inventories shipping smaller lots more frequently and demanding greater reliability package volume grew by  percent in  because of the recession the teamsters accepted a contract in  that limited wage increases to a costofliving adjustment which then was diverted to pay the increased cost of medical benefits when ups then released information showing its net income rose  percent in  labor relations worsened bitterness continued between ups management and drivers as company profits swelled  percent to  million in  ups and the teamsters secretly negotiated for two months in  and reached a threeyear agreement providing for bonuses and increased wages the move averted a probable strike by  employees despite this labor tension upss employee turnover remained remarkably low at  percent many workers were recruited as parttime employees while college students and were offered fulltime positions after graduation in  ups decided to offer overnight air service ups next day air charging about half of fedexs rate by  its secondday and nextday services were shipping a combined  packages a day in  ups earned  million on  billion in sales it had a fleet of more than  trucks mailorder firms and catalog houses were the fastest growing part of upss business jack rogers became ups chairman in  in  ups began offering international air service between the united states and six european countries despite labor troubles a fortune survey found upss reputation the highest in its industry every year from  to  it was by far the most profitable us transportation company making more than  million in  on revenue of  billion fedex however had  percent of the rapidly growing overnight package business ups had only  percent fedex was highly automated and used electronics to track packages en route and to perform other services ups still did most jobs manually but was rapidly switching to the use of electronic scanners at its sorting centers and to computers on its trucks ups introduced technology methodically buying a software firm and a computer design shop to create the necessary equipment it then fieldtested its new gear at a car messenger service it owned in los angeles it launched a  billion fiveyear computerization project trying to create a system that tracked packages doortodoor which fedex was doing already upss healthy river of cash flow enabled it to pay  billion for  aircraft in  the purchase made it the tenth largest us airline the company launched its first widerange television advertising campaign in  spending  million to publicize the slogan we run the tightest ship in the shipping business despite these expenses the company still had only  million in longterm debt and continued to finance large projects out of its cash flow by  upss ground service was growing by  to  percent per year and air service was growing by  percent per year ups handled  billion packages per year compared with  billion for the us postal service the plane fleet of the ups overnight service handled  parcels and documents per day making  million on  billion in sales in  ups continued building an overseas air network but in west germany where it had  employees it delivered only on the ground the company shipped eight million packages overseas in  losing  million in the process ups bought its italian partner alimondo in  hoping to use it and its german base to expand through europe the company also bought nine small european courier companies to expand air service its overseas acquisitions cost ups less than  million ups and rival fedex both were losing money on overseas operations but ups had an advantage fedex could not match its  billion in assets and  million in cash with minimal debt ups hoped this would give it greater staying power as the two companies struggled to build a global delivery network meanwhile ups slowly won some fedex customers by giving volume discounts which it previously had refused to do the overseas shipping war escalated as fedex bought tiger international inc a major international shipper that ups used for some of its foreign deliveries invigorated through new leadership in the s kent c nelson succeeded jack rogers as chairman and ceo in  nicknamed oz for sera band leader ozzie nelson the yearold had spent his entire working life at ups starting with the company only two days after graduating from college the new leader undertook a gradual but complete transformation of ups that extended from its innermost workings to its public image challenged by competitors large and small ups launched a plethora of new services in the early s these ranged from timed and sameday deliveries to less expensive two and threeday services the companys worldwide logistics subsidiary formed in  offered clients everything from inventory management to warehousing and of course delivery powerful and costly technical systems often developed internally by a member staff backed up these expanded operations upss diad delivery information acquisition device for example combined a barcode scanner electronic signature capture and cellular tracking network in a single handheld tool by  the corporation was investing more money in computers than in ubiquitous brown vehicles these internal changes reflected the companys traditional focus on superefficiency as well as its newfound emphasis on customer satisfaction in  meanwhile ups relocated its corporate headquarters from greenwich connecticut to atlanta georgia another important development during this period came in  when the corporation introduced a new stock purchase program that was open to all ups employeesboth full and parttime previously only management was given the opportunity to buy the stock in contrast to its secretive early years the ups of the s was a bold global marketer the company embarked on the largest advertising campaign in its history in  spending an estimated  million in conjunction with its sponsorship of the centennial olympics held in its new base of atlanta ups hoped that the worldwide recognition enjoyed by the olympic rings would rub off on its brown trucks which were not well known outside the united states that recognition was vital to the success of upss international operations which continued to lose money into the mids by  in fact losses on the companys european assault totaled nearly  billion but backed by its patient and confident employeestockholders and a hefty bank account ups was able to wait out publicly held fedex which had limited its european service to intercontinental deliveries by middecade in stark contrast ups had expanded its international network to include  countries and territories worldwide undaunted by its massive losses ups announced plans to invest more than  billion in its european operations from  to  and it infused another  million into its asian operations the company hoped to profit on its piece of the  billion european parcel post market by the end of the century this global push fueled a  percent increase in sales over the course of nelsons first six years at the helm of ups at the same time however it played a significant role in the reduction of the companys overall profit margin from  percent in  to  percent in  in january  james p kelly succeeded nelson as chairman and ceo kelly had worked his way up through the ranks having joined ups in  as a package car driver his first year at the company turned into a rough one as the  teamsters employees at ups went on strike for  days in august before agreeing to a new fiveyear pact in addition to wage increases the new agreement called for the creation of  new fulltime jobs and the shifting of  parttime workers into fulltime jobs as such jobs became available through attrition and growth the strike cost ups  million in lost revenue resulting in less than  percent sales growth for the year and a decline in profits to  million from the  figure of  billion ups shook off any lingering effects from the strike by  when its domestic shipping revenues jumped  percent reaching  billion ups continued to reap benefits from the evergrowing ecommerce section which was fueling demand for shipping services during the year the company rolled out a moneyback guarantee for ontime delivery for all of its ground businesstobusiness shipments other good news came in the form of the firstever annual profits for the companys international operations which now generated nearly  percent of overall revenues in  company executives determined that ups needed the added flexibility of publicly traded stock in order to pursue some larger acquisition targets thus in november ups completed what was then the largest initial public offering ipo ever conducted in the united states the company raised  billion by selling  million shares of newly created class b shares at  per share on the new york stock exchange the class a shares which controlled  percent of the voting rights at the company remained in the private hands of employees and retirees the newly public company whose official name was shortened from united parcel service of america inc to united parcel service inc was immediately confronted with a new challenge from fedex the archrival had bought a truckbased shipping company earlier in the year and then in  launched two new truckbased delivery services fexex ground specializing in businesstobusiness deliveries and fedex home delivery concentrating on deliveries to residences acquisitions at center stage in the early s upss postipo acquisition spree began with the  purchase of challenge air cargo a miamibased freight carrier operating in latin america that same year the firm gained the right to fly directly to china from the united states the following april ups began making six weekly freight flights to shanghai and beijing also in april  ups spent about  million in cash for mail boxes etc a us franchisebased chain of stores providing packing shipping and mail services there were more than  mail boxes etc locations throughout the united states as well as overseas and the chain was expected to expand upss services to small and homebased businesses and to consumers as well in may  as part of the companys aggressive move into global supplychain management ups acquired fritz companies inc in a  million stock swap fritz which specialized in freight forwarding customs brokering and logistics was subsequently renamed ups freight services then in late  ups freight services was merged with ups logistics group to form ups supply chain solutions a streamlined unit operating out of  countries and offering freight forwarding international trade management logistics and distribution and other specialized supplychain services at the beginning of  michael l eskew succeeded the retiring kelly as chairman and ceo eskew had joined the company in  as an industrial engineering manager and had risen to become executive vicepresident by  also in  ups extended its moneyback guarantee for ontime grounddelivered packages to include residential shipments within the continental united states and it also launched an advertising campaign featuring a new slogan what can brown do for you in early  most of the  mail boxes etc outlets in the united states began operating under a new name the ups store in the hope of capitalizing on the wellknown ups brand simultaneously the corporation revamped its logo for the first time since  the new logo kept the shield that had been part of the logo since  though the shield was modernized with a more threedimensional look the previous logos bowtied package was removed however as the company wanted to emphasize that it was involved in more than just shipping likewise the phrase worldwide delivery service which had appeared on its vehicle fleet was replaced with synchronizing the world of commerce thereby reflecting upss expanded activities in the wider supplychain industry brown remained the companys principal color also during  ups attempted to fend off the inroads that fedex and other competitors had made into its core domestic ground shipping business by shaving at least one day off the amount of time it needed to ship items between more than half of the largest us metropolitan areas despite the implosion of numerous ecommerce companies and the package deliveries that died along with the companies ups managed to continue to grow during the recessionary early s total revenues reached  billion by  with faster growth in international package deliveries and nonpackage operations including the extended supplychain activities and the ups store making up for shortfalls in the us package delivery sector as it neared its th anniversary in  ups remained one of the most respected companies in its industry and a formidable competitor one concern going forward was the aggressive move of deutsche post ag the german postal
