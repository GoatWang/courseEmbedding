review written on  by beautifuli am so sorry that you didnt get the results that you wanted and im sorry that you didnt have the positive experience most of my patients have i certainly remember you and your surgeries i first performed a rhinoplasty on you over  years ago it is my understanding reviewing our records that you were quite happy with your results at your three month and twelve month postoperative visits and that you even requested a second operation after your three month visit on another facial structure to further enhance your appearance which i performed to your satisfaction i certainly wish that i could have your permission to post your photographs so that you would be able to see that your ethnicity was not only maintained but enhanced as you requested and i agreed with there is no evidence in your postoperative photographs of a crooked nose or a pointy tip i last saw you  ½ years after your initial surgery and all was well at that appointment we never heard from you again until my office saw this review if i fail to provide the best result possible given the limitations of the patient’s individual features im always willing to make things right unfortunately unless a patient tells me theyre not happy with their results i cannot address the problem effectively because of the disparity in our views of your results i want to make sure that we do not have our wires crossed and that you are actually the patient that we are referring to in this response i am more than willing to make every attempt to address and resolve the issues you have raised to your satisfaction every patient matters to me so i hope that you will call my office to clear up any misunderstanding that may have occurred sincerely and respectfully jaime r garza md dds facsdonald d dilworth pajames e rated saw and was treated by this doctor for a bilateral inguinal hernia repair truely amazing doctor office wait was moderate length told me from the very beginning in good detail what he was going to do with the mesh listens and responds extremely well which seems to be somewhat rare for alot of doctors went to ne baptist to get my surgery taken care of by him the hospital wait was  hours overall but once i was wheeled in and put to sleep i was awake before i knew it with  scars on my groin hospital staff was very courteous and friendly great nurses as well as his own staff at his office pain was alot for me at first but this was my very first surgical procedure was put on some basic hydros and the doc put a pain belt on me that was connected to my  nerves in my groin that greatly eased the pain with regular set injections of numbing meds overall im greatly satisfied with how it went and how i feel now after  weeks recovery and am very pleased to not have any of the problems ive currently had for years now with my  hernias and can now live a normal active healthy life again it does take a while for your body to get used to the mesh though would recommend this doc to just about anybody  starsgonzaba medical groupkaren k ratedwas planning to change to another practice until i found out we were moving out of state i originally switched to this office because it was closer to our home ive had three doctors and a couple of them spoke english with such a heavy hispanic accent that even i had trouble understanding them and ive lived all over the world and have been exposed to many accents my next complaint is that almost every time my prescriptions were changed or i changed pharmacies and gave them the new one theyd send the prescription to the old one or fail to renew at least one of the prescriptions the people were all friendly but friendly doesnt help if they continually get something else wrong there is a huge turnover in the gonzaba medical group from what i can tell in doctors one of the best they have is dr denise tarver she only takes medicare patients and is wonderful and thorough unless you get her first appt of the day or after lunch expect a long wait because she doesnt herd her patients through like cattle and is constantly running late but id rather she take her time and study my moms records although its hard on the elderly to have to wait that long though especially when a patient is over bandera family health careharrydeanhood ratedbandera family health care witbandera family health care with dr ramon reyes and his wonderful assistants and staff provide the best health care in the san antonio tx metro area reyes is a wise and capable doctor his rapid dianosis and actions very possibly prevented my death when he determined i was infected with an ecoli infection he initiated action and treatment that brought my temperature down from  to normal and continued treatment and medication till the terrible issue was resolved over the past several years he continues to treat any of my ills with great success furthermore his assistants and staff provide me fast friendly and excellent care and attention he continues to add medical facilitiesstaff that provide onestop examinations thus many times eliminating the need to drive around the medical center area seeking exams his facility is growing and expanding and i recommend my family and friends utilize him and his facilities again  dr ramon saved my life to me he and his facilitystaff are number one harry dean hood retired aviation consultant helotes tx gonzaba medical groupsra v rateddr william so sorry that i’ve gone to urgent care never thought they could have received me with a doctor but god knows no energy is i really have suffered also maybe because i didn’t want to have heart surgery that has never bothered me the cardiologist told it was from birth i hear they call it a murmur i hardly never read the papers that i get at my appt only i started off balance than on top of it i fell luckily i didn’t break my ribs and melissa gonzales saw me at urgent care but you don’t know how much i’m grateful i should have gone to the hospital there’s no words to express myself to all your employees they’re very kind and willing to help me i was an orphan my dad died when i was  my mom in  so i didn’t have any school i would go to the field to pick cotton those times were hard but at least i learned a little rd grade well again i just wanted to thank you may the lord richly bless you my god i brought back the  sra dora villarrealfirefly pediatrics pllctia b ratedi just moved to san antonio and had some problems with my old dr keeping up with records and really even listening to my concerns over my children i called firefly because i needed help with my childrens shots before school even though i though my kids old dr had already done it seeing as though i took them just for that reason and was told they were up to date the dr and staff at fire fly listened to all my problems and concerns about my children and immediately tried figuring out the problem and fixed everything withought a problem i loved every staff member i met that day and the dr came in several times asking different questions and just really taking the time to get to know us it was quickenjoyable they took our insurance and im excited to finally feel like we have a dr who pays attention its worth the  min drive from my house and im so please i found a good dr in san antonio for my babies they deserve the bestvillanuevawindowsoul rateddr villanueva is the most fantastic obgyn in the worlddr v has been my obgyn doctor for  years since i was  years old he is incredibly patient and caring he looks you in the eye when he talks to you and when he is listening to you he asks you if you have any concerns and addresses them professionally with educated answers and information he has taken care of me many years prior to pregnancy during my pregnancy and now afterward he was previously part of a practice with other obgyns but opened up his own individual office about  years ago i believe he told me personally that he wanted to do this because he wants to better serve his patients which he is able to do with his own practice the hospital he delivers babies at is right across the street from his office i have always been comfortable talking with dr v as well as during my exams my mother has seen dr v for many years now as well we both just love him he is wonderfulalprin clifford nlynne m ratedi love dr alprin but his appointment clerk jamie is abrupt and rude when you are not feeling your best to begin with do you really want to have a conversation with a person who makes you feel like youre bothering them i worked for medical associates at the nix hospital for years and we would have been fired for speaking to patients in a rude and abrupt manner we always treated our patients with respect and yes we were very busy but we took our time with each patient first of all we loved all our patients and we were always happy to see them more times than not dr alprins clerical staff seem totally disinterested and unapproachable but jamie takes the cake staff please get a personality dr alprins patients will appreciate itkellum jr daniel h mdbenjaminroath ratedi recommend dr kellum and all of his staff for all of your family medical needsdr kellam has been our family doctor for over  years him and his staff are always thorough and very polite yes sometimes there is a little bit of a wait but they always make up for it when it is your turn what i really like is that they listen to everything and you never feel rushed like theyre trying to get to the next patient not like so many other doctor offices where they barely hear you in and out of the room taking care of other problems when you are sitting down in front of dr kellum or one of his staff it is really your time and you can see that they really care and sensitive to all of your needs so thank you dr kellum for taking care of my family and me benjamin e roatharzola jennifer m mdbonnie a ratedshe was my ob for my son  second child and she was awesome bc of my previous pregnancy and some complications that seemed recurring she wanted me to admit myself to the hospital earlier than usual which was the right thing to do bc she cared about my baby and making sure he was well taken care of and also myself she fought my insurance when they didnt want to pay for my hospital stay and for me i knew she cared for the well being of my son when a doctor goes over and beyond this way you know they are not in it for the money but because they care for their patients it is difficult to find doctors such as dr arzola i highly recommend herdid you knowphysicians and surgeons help to keep people  from infants to the elderly  as healthy as possible these individuals provide diagnoses and treatments

the time to discuss and address your worriesexpertise level if youre going in for surgery you want someone that knows what theyre doing and has a high success rate ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it this will give you peace of mind that youre in capable handsunderstanding your insuranceyour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have you may have insurance through employment your spouse your parents if youre under  or the marketplace if the previous options dont apply to you its important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what youll need to pay foryour insurance will have a deductible which is the amount that youre responsible to pay for covered medical expenses some plans have coinsurances where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill and insurance will cover the rest copays state a flat rate for certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or within a family plan your insurance may pay for  percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan yearif you plan to go to the doctor need medication or have been recommended for surgery call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers you can choose the best doctor for your needs understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early

review written on  by beautifuli am so sorry that you didnt get the results that you wanted and im sorry that you didnt have the positive experience most of my patients have i certainly remember you and your surgeries i first performed a rhinoplasty on you over  years ago it is my understanding reviewing our records that you were quite happy with your results at your three month and twelve month postoperative visits and that you even requested a second operation after your three month visit on another facial structure to further enhance your appearance which i performed to your satisfaction i certainly wish that i could have your permission to post your photographs so that you would be able to see that your ethnicity was not only maintained but enhanced as you requested and i agreed with there is no evidence in your postoperative photographs of a crooked nose or a pointy tip i last saw you  ½ years after your initial surgery and all was well at that appointment we never heard from you again until my office saw this review if i fail to provide the best result possible given the limitations of the patient’s individual features im always willing to make things right unfortunately unless a patient tells me theyre not happy with their results i cannot address the problem effectively because of the disparity in our views of your results i want to make sure that we do not have our wires crossed and that you are actually the patient that we are referring to in this response i am more than willing to make every attempt to address and resolve the issues you have raised to your satisfaction every patient matters to me so i hope that you will call my office to clear up any misunderstanding that may have occurred sincerely and respectfully jaime r garza md dds facsdonald d dilworth pajames e rated saw and was treated by this doctor for a bilateral inguinal hernia repair truely amazing doctor office wait was moderate length told me from the very beginning in good detail what he was going to do with the mesh listens and responds extremely well which seems to be somewhat rare for alot of doctors went to ne baptist to get my surgery taken care of by him the hospital wait was  hours overall but once i was wheeled in and put to sleep i was awake before i knew it with  scars on my groin hospital staff was very courteous and friendly great nurses as well as his own staff at his office pain was alot for me at first but this was my very first surgical procedure was put on some basic hydros and the doc put a pain belt on me that was connected to my  nerves in my groin that greatly eased the pain with regular set injections of numbing meds overall im greatly satisfied with how it went and how i feel now after  weeks recovery and am very pleased to not have any of the problems ive currently had for years now with my  hernias and can now live a normal active healthy life again it does take a while for your body to get used to the mesh though would recommend this doc to just about anybody  starsgonzaba medical groupkaren k ratedwas planning to change to another practice until i found out we were moving out of state i originally switched to this office because it was closer to our home ive had three doctors and a couple of them spoke english with such a heavy hispanic accent that even i had trouble understanding them and ive lived all over the world and have been exposed to many accents my next complaint is that almost every time my prescriptions were changed or i changed pharmacies and gave them the new one theyd send the prescription to the old one or fail to renew at least one of the prescriptions the people were all friendly but friendly doesnt help if they continually get something else wrong there is a huge turnover in the gonzaba medical group from what i can tell in doctors one of the best they have is dr denise tarver she only takes medicare patients and is wonderful and thorough unless you get her first appt of the day or after lunch expect a long wait because she doesnt herd her patients through like cattle and is constantly running late but id rather she take her time and study my moms records although its hard on the elderly to have to wait that long though especially when a patient is over bandera family health careharrydeanhood ratedbandera family health care witbandera family health care with dr ramon reyes and his wonderful assistants and staff provide the best health care in the san antonio tx metro area reyes is a wise and capable doctor his rapid dianosis and actions very possibly prevented my death

also maybe because i didn’t want to have heart surgery that has never bothered me the cardiologist told it was from birth i hear they call it a murmur i hardly never read the papers that i get at my appt only i started off balance than on top of it i fell luckily i didn’t break my ribs and melissa gonzales saw me at urgent care but you don’t know how much i’m grateful i should have gone to the hospital there’s no words to express myself to all your employees they’re very kind and willing to help me i was an orphan my dad died when i was  my mom in  so i didn’t have any school i would go to

villarrealfirefly pediatrics pllctia b ratedi just moved to san antonio and had some problems with my old dr keeping up with records and really even listening to my concerns over my children i called firefly because i needed help with my childrens shots before school even though i though my kids old dr had already done it seeing as though i took them just for that reason and was told they were up to date the dr and staff at fire fly listened to all my problems and concerns about my children and immediately tried figuring out the problem and fixed everything withought a problem i loved every staff member i met that day and the dr came in several times asking different questions and just really taking the time to get to know us it was quickenjoyable they took our insurance and im excited to finally feel like we have a dr who pays attention its worth the  min drive from my house and im so please i found a good dr in san antonio for my babies they deserve the bestvillanuevawindowsoul rateddr villanueva is the most fantastic obgyn in the worlddr v has been my obgyn doctor for  years since i was  years old he is incredibly patient and caring he looks you in the eye when he talks to you and when he is listening to you he asks you if you have any concerns and addresses them professionally with educated answers and information he has taken care of me many years prior to pregnancy during my pregnancy and now afterward he was previously part of a practice with other obgyns but opened up his own individual office about  years ago i believe he told me personally that he wanted to do this because he wants to better serve his patients which he is able to do with his own practice the hospital he delivers babies at is right across the street from his office i have always been comfortable talking with dr v as well as during my exams my mother has seen dr v for many years now as well we both just love him he is wonderfulalprin clifford nlynne m ratedi love dr alprin but his appointment clerk jamie is abrupt and rude when you are not feeling your best to begin with do you really want to have a conversation with a person who makes you feel like youre bothering them i worked for medical associates at the nix hospital for years and we would have been fired for speaking to patients in a rude and abrupt manner we always treated our patients with respect and yes we were very busy but we took our time with each patient first of all we loved all our patients and we were always happy to see them more times than not dr alprins clerical staff seem totally disinterested and unapproachable but jamie takes the cake staff please get a personality dr alprins patients will appreciate itkellum jr daniel h mdbenjaminroath ratedi recommend dr kellum and all of his staff for all of your family medical needsdr kellam has been our family doctor for over  years him and his staff are always thorough and very polite yes sometimes there is a little bit of a wait but they always make up for it when it is your turn what i really like is that they listen to everything and you never feel rushed like theyre trying to get to the next patient not like so many other doctor offices where they barely hear you in and out of the room taking care of other problems when you are sitting down in front of dr kellum or one of his staff it is really your time and you can see that they really care and sensitive to all of your needs so thank you dr kellum for taking care of my family and me benjamin e roatharzola jennifer m mdbonnie a ratedshe was my ob for my son  second child and she was awesome bc of my previous pregnancy and some complications that seemed recurring she wanted me to admit myself to the hospital earlier than usual which was the right thing to do bc she cared about my baby and making sure he was well taken care of and also myself she fought my insurance when they didnt want to pay for my hospital stay and for me i knew she cared for the well being of my son when a doctor goes over and beyond this way you know they are not in it for the money but because they care for their patients it is difficult to find doctors such as dr arzola i highly recommend herdid you knowphysicians and surgeons help to keep people  from infants to the elderly  as healthy as possible these individuals provide diagnoses and treatments

affected by the insurance plan you have you may have insurance through employment your spouse your parents if youre under  or the marketplace if the previous options dont apply to you its important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what youll need to pay foryour insurance will have a deductible which is the amount that youre responsible to pay for covered medical expenses some plans have coinsurances where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill and insurance will cover the rest copays state a flat rate for certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or within a family plan your insurance may pay for  percent of covered

an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early
