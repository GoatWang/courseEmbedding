capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros moodys standard  poors fitch and eganjones if two nrsros have rated a security fund companies are to report the lowest rating if three or more nrsros have rated the same security differently fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle for example if nrsro x rates a security aa nrsro y rates the same security an a and nrsro z rates it a bbb the fund company should use the credit rating of a in its reporting to morningstar please note morningstar inc is not itself an nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund an nrsro rating on a fixedincome security can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive for municipal bond funds morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration in these cases static breakpoints are utilized these breakpoints are as follows i limited  years or less ii moderate more than  years but less than  years and iii extensive more than  years in addition for nonus taxable and nonus domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used i limited less than or equal to  years ii moderate greater than  and less than equal to  years iii extensive greater than  years unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers the adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees including but not limited to distribution and service b fees and reimburse certain expenses there is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time day sec yield is calculated based on a formula mandated by the securities and exchange commission sec that calculates a funds hypothetical annualized income as a percentage of its assets a securitys income for the purposes of this calculation is based on the current market yield to maturity in the case of bonds or projected dividend yield for stocks of the funds holdings over a trailing  day period this hypothetical income will differ at times significantly from the funds actual experience as a result income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the sec yield month trailing distribution yield at nav refers to the month historical cash flow paid over the past  months in dividends divided by the past months ending nav alpha beta rsquared standard deviation sharpe ratio and capture ratio are  year statistics alpha is a measure of a funds actual returns and expected performance given its level of risk as measured by beta beta reflects the sensitivity of the funds return to fluctuations in the market index rsquared indicates how much of a funds fluctuations were attributable to movements in the funds benchmark standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a funds returns are sharpe ratio is a measure of a funds riskadjusted performance capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return upside capture or negative return downside capture the morningstar rating™ for funds or star rating is calculated for managed products including mutual funds variable annuity and variable life subaccounts exchangetraded funds closedend funds and separate accounts with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed products monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance and does not include the effects of sales charges the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year

stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros moodys standard  poors fitch and eganjones if two nrsros have rated a security fund companies are to report the lowest rating if three or more nrsros have rated the same security differently fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle for example if nrsro x rates a security aa nrsro y rates the same security an a and nrsro z rates it a bbb the fund company should use the credit rating of a in its reporting to morningstar please note morningstar inc is not itself an nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund an nrsro rating on a fixedincome security can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive for municipal bond funds morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration in these cases static breakpoints are utilized these breakpoints are as follows i limited  years or less ii moderate more than  years but less than  years and iii extensive more than  years in addition for nonus taxable and nonus domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used i limited less than or equal to  years ii

equity fund addition modifies international balanced fund to ivy global income allocation fund launches ivy global equity income fund june    pm eastern daylight time overland park kanbusiness wireeffective today ivy funds has expanded its global product line launching a new ivy global equity income fund and modifying an existing fund to bring to market ivy global income allocation fund together these steps further enhance ivy funds’ global product lineup providing additional global equity and allocation choices for investors and financial advisors the changes include ivy international balanced fund becomes ivy global income allocation fund under its new moniker and expanded investment mandate this fund which has an objective of seeking total return through a combination of current income and capital appreciation can go anywhere in the world to find the most compelling equity and fixedincome investment opportunities until now because the fund was an international rather than a global fund the fund’s manager was unable to take advantage of investment opportunities in the united states the fund was incepted in  and will carry forward its performance history ivy global equity income fund a new fund that invests in equities primarily in developed markets issued by companies that the portfolio managers believe may generate a reasonable level of current income and that demonstrate favorable prospects for total return it may invest in us and nonus firms of any size though it plans to primarily invest in largecap names the global nature of this fund makes it one of the first in the industry to offer a truly global equity income opportunity these changes mean that the ivy funds family offers a comprehensive lineup for a range of investor needs including flexible portfolio funds that can invest in any asset class around the world allocation funds that typically seek to maintain a consistent balance of investments within ranges defined by each fund’s prospectus and funds designed to generate consistent income such as through dividendpaying stocks or highyield and municipal bonds “investors increasingly are looking for dividendincome potential given today’s secular demographic realities and lowinterest rate slowgrowth economic environment” said thomas w butch president and ceo of ivy funds distributor inc “these additions to the ivy funds lineup give investors the ability to pursue dividend income through investments around the world very efficiently whether they want dividend paying equities or a broader allocation approach that includes fixed income” ivy global income allocation fund is comanaged by john maxwell cfa who has  years of industry experience and has managed the former ivy international balanced fund for the last three years and w jeffery surles cfa who has  years of industry experience and has been a fixed income investment analyst with ivy funds for five years robert nightingale who has been with ivy funds for  years is assistant portfolio manager on the fund ivy global equity income fund is comanaged by maxwell and nightingale by prospectus ivy global income allocation fund will ordinarily invest at least  percent of its total assets in equity investments at least  percent in fixedincome securities and may invest up to  percent of its total assets in noninvestment grade lowrated debt securities which could provide additional income for shareholders albeit at greater risk its benchmark is a  percent percent blend of the msci world high dividend yield index and the barclays multiverse index a custom blend index barclays multiverse index is comprised of securities that represent the global bond market msci world high dividend yield index is designed to reflect the performance of equities excluding reits with higher than average dividend yields that are both sustainable and persistent ivy global equity income fund according to its prospectus will invest at least  percent of its net assets in equity securities with a focus on dividendpaying securities around the globe its benchmark is the msci world high dividend yield index industry analysts report that equity income funds have grown in demand as investors reach for yield according to strategic insight for example investors directed more than  billion into equity income funds in  one of the only

summary prospectus containing this and other information for any of the ivy funds call your financial advisor or visit wwwivyfundscom please read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing investment return and principal value will fluctuate and it is possible to lose money by investing past performance is not a guarantee of future results consider all factors an investment in the funds is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency international investing involves additional risks including currency fluctuations political or economic conditions affecting the foreign country and differences in accounting standards and foreign regulations these risks are magnified in emerging markets fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk and as such the net asset value of the funds may fall as interest rates rise investing in highincome securities may carry a greater risk of nonpayment or interest or principal than higherrated bonds dividendpaying investments may not experience the same price appreciation as nondividend paying instruments dividendpaying companies may not pay a dividend or the dividend may be less than expected these and other risks are more fully described in the funds’ prospectus not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all brokerdealers
