within your target heart rate zone — or the upper limit of what your cardiovascular system can handle during physical activity — so that you can burn more calories in less time and melt fat long after your workout is complete “accuracy is critical for efficient training based on heart rate zones and too many wearables that claim to measure heart rate give false reads if you’re basing your workouts on the wrong hr data you’re probably over or under training” said moov’s cofounder and ceo meng li “after extensive research and testing we’ve determined that the best location for accurate pulse reading is the head that’s why we’ve developed technology around these findings so that anyone regardless of their fitness level or goals can get the most out of every workout for a fraction of the

jeremy kahn july    am edt fund is the fifth for the luxembourgbased venture firm past successes include investments in skype wixcom mangrove capital partners the luxembourgbased venture capital firm has raised a  million fund to invest in european startups but its outspoken founder has no interest in startups looking for a quick buckthe fund which is mangrove’s fifth since its founding  years ago will invest in early stage companies said cofounder and chief executive officer mark tluszcz in an interviewmangrove was one of the first investors in skype turning a  million investment into a  million gain according to the firm it was also an early backer of israelibased wixcom which helps small businesses manage websites mangrove’s initial  million investment in wixcom was worth  million after its initial public offering on nasdaq in  mangrove said mangrove remains wixcom’s biggest shareholder and tluszcz serves as the company’s chairman our early success with skype created a culture of risktaking in the firm he said adding that it has given mangrove the confidence to encourage entrepreneurs not to sell out too early he says that in the past a lack of ambition and pressure from less aggressive venture capital firms has often resulted in european technology founders selling their companies too soon he says this is one reason europe has not produced a company to rival us technology giants such as facebook inc and alphabet inc he saidmangrove now manages more than  billion with an investment team of  with offices in berlin and tel aviv in addition to luxembourg the investor has backed a total of  start ups exclusive insights on technology around the world get fully charged from bloomberg technology sign up tluszcz is known for his sometimes controversial stances he has been an outspoken critic of many socalled unicorns  private companies valued at more than  billion  saying that these companies were fake unicorns having inflated their valuations with financial engineering and accounting gimmicks last year he also warned of a dangerous bubble among financial technology startups saying that many of these companies would not result in big pay days for investorswhile a number of european venture capital firms have been increasing the size of the funds they raise and have begun putting money into later stage companies tluszcz said that mangrove purposefully chose to keep its overall fund size relatively smallhe said this enabled the firm to stay focused on earlystage investments  where most funding rounds are less than  million  while still reserving enough money in the fund to enable it to build up a significant stake in successful businesses throughout their growth staying relatively small also allows the fund to potentially rack up bigger percentage gains from its most successful investments rather than becoming a larger fund we have opted to stay small to maximize the performance of our fund he said adding that studies have shown that larger funds tend to result in diminishing returns we don’t want to change a recipe that works very well for usmangrove raised the new fund in two months tluszcz said with  percent of money coming from investors that had backed previous funds while he declined to name these investors citing confidentiality agreements tluszcz said that they included about  pension funds and highnet worth individuals half of which are located in the us  percent in europe and  percent in asia before its here its on the bloomberg terminal learn more most read tesla buyers antsy for model  keys months
