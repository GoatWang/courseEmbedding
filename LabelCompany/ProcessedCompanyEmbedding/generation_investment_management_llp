available our offices our offices in london and new york were built with a focus on sustainability our london office building has the excellent rating by breeam and the interior modelling has the “gold ska” rating similarly our new york office is one of the most energy efficient and ecologically friendly buildings in new york as the first skyscraper with a “platinum leed” certification for environmental excellence design and construction elements of our offices make significant contributions to energy and water savings and waste management energy use a material proportion of the london office building’s energy is provided by decentralised combined cooling heat and power units including one of the uk’s largest installations of fuel cell technology photovoltaic cells and thermal

recycled content for blockwork both of our offices have onsite processes for the separation collection and recycling of different types of waste materials including food waste water use our london

carbon emissions of our business activities on an annual basis while we strive to manage our usage and sourcing decisions we recognise the constraints inherent within the necessary business travel especially air travel we base the measurement and offsetting of the firm’s carbon footprint on our business travel and office use as well as the carbon emissions created by generation team members and their families in the course of their personal lives we chose the highest standard of carbon credit instrument and more importantly we ensure that the underlying projects offer sustainable loweremission alternatives to existing practices we consult with third parties to apply widelyaccepted emissions factors to measure our travel energy use and household data whilst we appreciate that carbon credits do not provide a complete solution they contribute to mitigate our overall environmental impact travel while we regard travel as a necessary part of our business for investment and

such as video and teleconference technologies we continue to work with technology specialists to enhance the quality of our distance meeting systems our offices in london and new york are both

between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free
