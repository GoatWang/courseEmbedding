index the fund is passively managed so it generally does not reallocate its holdings based on changes in market conditions or outlook as a result its expenses are typically lower than the expenses of an actively managed fund the fund seeks to match the performance of the entire us stock market as represented by the sp total market index but does not attempt to fully replicate the index by holding
