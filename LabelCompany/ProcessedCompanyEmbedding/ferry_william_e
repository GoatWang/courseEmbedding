chandler tribune staff writerlands end inc chairman gary comer likes people to believe that he is sailing the world far from the daytoday concerns of the dodgeville wisbased catalog company he founded in  customers can even track comers course on the lands end web sitebut comer  was firmly back in control wednesday as the cataloger tossed overboard chief executive michael j smith also thrown over the side was william e ferry lands ends vice chairman of sales and a veteran who played a major role in building the  billion company before it went publictaking the helm as chief executive and president is david dyer a former lands end vice chairman who left the company in 99 for home shopping network in floridathe changes come after two choppy quarters for lands end profits are sagging inventories are ballooning and debt is soaring the companys share price meanwhile has fallen almost  percent since february to around obviously comer has a pretty heavy hand its a very negative thing for a company like lands end to have three presidents in five years said maxwell sroge an evanstonbased catalog consultantjust four years ago smith then  was comers handpicked successor after the board ousted ceo william end a veteran catalog executive from ll bean who had shaken up lands ends culture by acquiring other catalogs and pushing aside some company veteranssmiths youth and lack of experience outside lands end led many industry players to think he was just a figurehead for comer a charge smith always deniedsmiths marching orders from comer who controls  percent of lands end stock were to take the company back to its roots by focusing on highquality casual clothing and topdrawer customer servicehe took to the task with fervor during his tenure smith divested specialty catalogs including montbell america and the territory ahead and just this month he put willis  geiger a specialty book of apparel and gear for outdoor adventurers on the blocksmith also made an expensive bet to boost the catalogs instock order fulfillment rate to  percent an unheardof figure for the catalog industry experts say but that wager hasnt paid offat the end of the second quarter lands ends inventory had expanded  percent to  million while its shortterm borrowings increased almost tenfold to  million from  million a year earlierlands end a traditionally tightlipped company says that the companys recent stumbles werent the reason smith and ferry had to gowhen the board looks at where were going from here they see economic uncertainty both here and abroad and the core business is still problematic said spokeswoman charlotte lacomb they felt the best choice to deal with these longterm problems was dave dyerneither dyer nor smith were available for commentafter parting ways with home shopping network dyer  has been working as a consultant for j crew group while the casual apparel cataloger searches for a permanent chief executivedyer is known as a good merchant and experienced manager according to industry sources he will need both those qualities they say as he competes against a bevy of energized purveyors of casual clothing such as gap
