lessons from harleydavidson’s turnaround clyde fessler shares tips for rebuilding a brand february   angela d harris keywords distribution  distributors  rebuilding a brand reprints no comments harleydavidson stores used to look like warehouse spaces with motorcycles but have since become showcases of unique individuality like this one mention walmart amazon or target and watch as emotions flash across a listener’s face whether drawn from experience knowledge or the news brands often leave impressions that are difficult to overcome some are positive others negative but either way there is something there with the ability to evoke a customer response that response is what many businesses are trying to protect hvac distributors are no exception each day distribution businesses endeavor to create positive experiences for their customers all while differentiating themselves from the distributor down the street often there is overlap in products and services as the competition drags on and distributors can be left to wonder “how do i keep my customers coming back” rags to riches branding meet clyde fessler retired vice president of business development for the harleydavidson motor co turned motivational speaker fessler was a key player in the turnaround harleydavidson experienced after the company’s competitors began taking market share some were imitating the product as well that coupled with a hell’s angel bikerbar image made it difficult for harleydavidson to survive earlier on in its history fessler explained the ups and downs of these tough times at harleydavidson to the distributors that attended one of the keynote luncheons during heating airconditioning and refrigeration distributors international’s hardi’s  annual conference he encouraged attendees that even though a product can be imitated a brand cannot fessler then unfolded a story of harleydavidson’s comeback and the key takeaways he had learned about branding that change businesses three questions in brand building when it comes to building a brand fessler explained there were three key elements distributors should consider all three come in the form of questions that require honest answers the first question fessler asked is “who are you” it can be answered by looking at key services and functions of a business and focusing in on what the business is meant to be businesses with an identity crisis can struggle to answer this question as they endeavor to be all things to all customers the second question is “who are your customers” who the distributor is selling to could change the business game as well as the marketing and branding messages being considered the third question to ask is “what do your customers expect” if customers expect handson training with lunch and the distributor provides an instructional video without refreshments the training service might not be viewed as productive because it wasn’t what the customer expected jonathan byrnes senior lecturer at the massachusetts institute of technology mit expressed the importance of meeting customer expectations in his book “islands of profit in a sea of red ink” “managers at different levels of your customer companies will have fundamentally different definitions of effective customer service” he said “even if you make your customers’ frontline managers happy you may still lose the executive suite” he goes on to explain that “customer service is the starting point and ending point for any effective account relationship it is a critical profit lever that is very often misunderstood” tips to improve brand business a harleydavidson business tip — promote your brand not your product many companies already have a brand image and customer service plan in place here are some tips that fessler provided to help improve brand and business performance during his presentation “make your staff and customers the ambassadors of your brand” he said for harleydavidson this meant making their dealers unique sellers who had completely bought in to the company culture when competition got in the way of harleydavidson the company often went a different way to bypass them “your business needs to be the alternative to your competitors” explained fessler “drive a wedge between you and your competition turn left when they go right” he went on to express the importance of turning negatives into positives and both for the customer as well as for the distribution business fessler also showed how examining why a business is not getting the sale as opposed to why it is getting sales can be eye opening into the brand and the sales process challenging management constructs most businesses experience complacency in its sales and processes at one time or another even some of the most successful companies like harleydavidson have hit lows that seemed insurmountable to help address this fessler noted how important it is to establish metrics on everything done in the business “if you want to change something” he said “measure it” byrnes took a look at the challenge of change as well and he explained that “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” is one of the worst management approaches that can be taken in business “leading companies are great because no matter how good they are they are desperate to get better lagging companies are most often complacent and selfsatisfied that’s why they stay behind” said byrnes “every company has enormous potential waiting to be unleashed a potential for enhanced profitability for accelerated growth and for renewing change the key to achieving this potential is precise thinking and business discipline on the part of every manager particularly those at the top” if looks could kill one of the fundamental changes harleydavidson made during its turnaround was to its stores and branches what used to look like warehouse spaces with motorcycles lining the aisles became showcases of unique individuality for each store “if your location looks like a warehouse then customers will expect warehouse pricing” noted fessler “harleydavidson had to enter the modern world of merchandising” these changes and hard work from the management and its employees helped turn around harleydavidson to become one of the most famous american motorcycle companies the final ingredient to this success was the people according to fessler “people bring the passion to the business” visit wwwclydefesslercom or wwwjlbyrnescom for more information sidebar harleydavidson business tips  make your staff and

is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first

or to the right of bing yahoo and msn search results and you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website expand your targeting both for location and for devices computer mobile and tablet make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer customers visit your site but if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid that would lower your costperclick and help stretch your budget how do i know if bing ads is working view a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats ad clicks the number of times your ad appeared impressions spend average costperclick
