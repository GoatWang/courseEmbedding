return of  in  � a result of a decline with the rest of the financial stocks � mr wilkus is predicting a rebound in  mr wilkus believes the deteriorating economy and credit crunch are providing opportunity for his companys business his prediction appears to be playing out while not yet in positive territory american capital has posted returns of  better than the sp s  return how did he do it largely by blazing his own path born edward frank wilkus  years ago in coffeyville kan population  he changed his name to malon pronounced like the italian city of milan when he was  because he liked the sound of it after two years at the university of illinois where he studied computer science and sociology mr wilkus dropped out in  then with  in his pocket and a very nice camera he set off for latin america selling the camera to get across the border from mexico to belize after running out of money in costa rica he took on a series of odd jobs including selling the encyclopaedia britannica doortodoor in spanish since i didnt know spanish it was a tough job � a very tough job mr wilkus laughed later working as a busboy at a french restaurant he came up with a unique way to fish for shrimp and convinced the restaurant owner to invest in his idea the shrimp business flopped but mr wilkus discovered he enjoyed raising money to fund his ideas returning to the united states and college in  he joined the east wind commune in missouri i think my parents were distressed by that mr wilkus said ruefully he spent the next nine years at the commune where he made hammocks sandals and nut butters that were sold to food coops and pier  inc of fort worth texas i learned most of what i know about business today from that experience mr wilkus said explaining that he grew to understand the motivation of customers and investors in  he left the commune for a job in marketing at the calvert group an asset management firm in bethesda where he learned how to gather assets three years later mr wilkus launched american capital from the living room of his twobedroom condo which he shared with his wife susan and their three children he got a  loan from people he had known from his commune days and maxed out his credit cards for an additional  it was a very very difficult business to start mr wilkus said initially american capital focused on helping workers at small and mediumsized companies acquire their employers by using employee stock ownership plans in  he took american capital public as a business development company offering debt financing or taking equity stakes in buyout situations today the company boasts  employees with offices in  cities around the world we built a privateequity firm that the average american can invest in mr wilkus said weve democratized private equity american capital investors can take part in buyout deals simply by purchasing shares which recently traded at  a pop as a business development company american capital avoids paying federal taxes if it distributes at least  of its income as dividends for this reason the companys dividend has always been high which attracts shareholders for years wall street naysayers accused the company of not earning enough to cover the lofty dividend and suggested it needed the capital markets to fund the distribution for the last  years in every single year we have covered  of our dividend with ordinary taxable income and even paid out excess amounts in bonus dividends mr wilkus countered to offer onestop buyouts that dont require extra time or additional financing to close the company raises cash several times a year through secondary offerings it has completed  such offerings since its ipo six of them in  since last june it has raised  billion even in a down market the fact that they can still go out and raise equity is a sign of the markets confidence in the company said troy ward a senior analyst with stifel nicolaus  co of st louis over the years american capital has invested in a broad range of companies including gibson guitar corp bumble bee foods llc aamco transmissions inc riddell sports group inc and piper aircraft inc it offers an array of financing including senior and mezzanine debt and equity investments this diversification helps to insulate american capital mr wilkus contends the biggest risk facing the company is the health of the economy which could affect the operations of companies that american capital has acquired or helped with debt financing mr troy said in the first quarter american capital posted a loss of  million most of which the company attributed to an accounting change related to fair value financial accounting standard  because mr wilkus believes the economy will get worse before it gets better his company is scrutinizing potential deals more closely currently he is avoiding restaurants automakers and cyclical companies but sees opportunities in energy medical products selected financial institutions and some distressed companies he also is warming up to housingrelated companies believing that housing will bottom next year there are even more opportunities abroad theres a

comments from ceo malon wilkus should help put its businesses in perspective jordan wathen tmfvaluemagnet dec   at pm finance ceos are usually tightlipped on conference calls but put them in a room of their peers  bankers and analysts  and theyll really open up malon wilkus ceo of american capital ltd nasdaqacas recently appeared at the jp morgan smid cap conference to deliver some very interesting tidbits of information to close observers heres the meat of the presentation in fewer than  words  the asset management business is gravyamerican capitals asset management business is its bread and butter providing dividends in the range of  million quarter after quarter the biggest slice comes from its management fees from its prized mreits american capital agency nasdaqagnc and american capital mortgage nasdaqmtge american capital agency is the bigger mreit of the two holding  billion in feeearning assets on which american capital ltd earns   million in annual fees american capital earns annual fees of  from american capital mortgage asset management is a fantastic business because it requires little to no new investment to grow income if there is any one business under the american capital umbrella that moves the needle its the asset management business  structured products are a cash machinesecond to the asset management business is the structured product business in which american capital invests in collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgagebacked securities malon wilkus commented that the clo book earned a  internal rate of return over its history the mortgagebacked securities business performed poorly producing negative  internal rates of return  the structured product business is a very small slice of american capitals asset value but like the asset management arm it produces an outsized amount of net operating income in the third quarter of  structured products were valued at roughly  of nav but produced  of revenue  wilkus doesnt think bdcs are american capitals peersamerican capital ltd is a business development company much like prospect capital or ares capital however it is very different than most bdcs on the public market for one it doesnt pay a dividend secondly it invests primarily in equity not debt wilkus called other bdcs finance companies whereas american capital ltd is more of an operating company because it invests heavily in companies it controls wilkus believes american capital is best compared to a diversified growth company like roper industries  or danaher both of which own numerous subsidiaries that drive total corporatelevel income alas in the eyes of the regulators and irs american capital is every bit of a bdc comparing american capital to roper and danaher is interesting its largely expected that american capital ltd will eventually become a diversified growth company by splitting its debt and equity investment portfolios into two publicly traded entities such a move could help it realize a higher valuation   controlled companies are earning moneyone of the problems with american capital ltd is that it is an investment company thus it doesnt report income earned by portfolio companies unless that income is paid to american capital ltd as a dividend the only insight into its portfolio company earnings comes from how american capital values its investments in its operating
