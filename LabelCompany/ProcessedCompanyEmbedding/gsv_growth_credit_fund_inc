· an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies’ ability to continue to operate which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies     · such an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the companies that we intend to target for investment potentially causing us to experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished demand for capital from these companies     · a contraction of available credit andor an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities     · interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results particularly if we elect to use leverage as part of our investment strategy     · currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our

prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies     · our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties     · the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives
