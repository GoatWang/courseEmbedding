registration statement and prospectus we have numerous direct indirect and partial competitors many of which have valuable industry relationships and access to greater resources than we do there is no assurance that we will be able to produce a product that will be competitive in the marketplace and even if competitive that we will be able to earn a profit the numerous types of direct or indirect competitors that exist in the market today include but may not be limited to sales and marketing firms marketing consultants design services ad agencies media buying firms internet marketing firms online social media firms and others key competitors include chicago advertising  marketing cam a leader in direct marketing for the hearing aid industry since  beeman marketing a marketing firm specializing in hearing care practitioners and audiologists since  and nutshell marketing a high quality direct response marketing firm specialized in targeting  and older age group the alliance faces competition from major retail distributors andor networks there is a rapid growth of manufacturerowned retail stores major consolidation has taken place in the us market by the hearing aid manufacturers in the last few years with almost every manufacturer participating in buying out other smaller manufacturers resulting in many different brand labels controlled under the same parent company umbrella this consolidation has allowed the manufacturers to increase and control more of their distribution by offering different levels in their product lines throughout their different brands this has also allowed the manufacturers to implement different price strategies for the same technology throughout their brands this consolidation has not only increased their market share but also increased their profit margins the internet is fast becoming a major factor in the distribution of hearing aids in the us numerous small companies are on the internet advertising hearing aids for the cheapest price and the largest hearing aid manufacturer sonova which owns hearingplanet is most prominent among these online offerings however internet sales still require the participation of a local practitioner for testing and fitting this limits the widespread geographic appeal of internet sales company description innerscope advertising agency inc iaa is a nevada corporation incorporated june   with its principal place of business in roseville california on june   iaa acquired innerscope advertising agency llc through this acquisition and plan of share exchange with innerscope advertising agency llc “illc” a commonly owned entity iaa acquired a  interest of all membership interests in illc on november   iaa entered into an acquisition and plan of share exchange with intelahear llc “intelahear” a commonly owned entity whereby iaa acquired  of the outstanding membership interests of intelahear iaa herein after referring to iaa illc and intelahear or “the company” was formed to fill the gap in the advertisingmarketing side of the hearing device industry both illc and intelahear were controlled and majority owned by our chairman moore family hearing company “mfhc” a related party controlled by our chairman accounted for approximately  and  of our sales for the three months ended march   and  respectively and  and  of our sales for the years ended december   and  respectively iaa is dedicated to serving the retail hearing aid dispensing community through generating traffic and consumer interest for hearing aid dispensing practices whether the practice is small medium or large the company has previously shown an ability to increase the total revenue without increasing cost there are over  retail hearing aid dispensing practices in the united states the company operates in a highly competitive and growing industry the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development of interactive technologies and mediums along with their integration within all offerings has fragmented consumer audiences especially the  age sector which is iaa client’s primary targeted audience these developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to marketing service providers such as iaa for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures iaa has operated in many major markets across the united states and continues to provide a comprehensive range of services to mfhc grouped into four fundamental disciplines advertisingmarketing customer relationship management crm public relations and specialty communications management believes the acquisition of intelahear provides the potential for expanding the company’s business model through a potential value proposition to the hearing aid dispenser intelahear future plans will enable independent hearing aid practitioners to leverage the purchasing power of the hearing devices by grouping together and aggregating their purchases this group will be managed by intelahear and be known as the intelahear alliance alliance the potential savings to the member of the alliance may be significant and may increase their operating margin on april   intelahear executed a  year supply agreement with gn hearing care corporation dba as gn resound “gn resound” one of the world’s leading manufacturers of hearing devices this supply agreement enables the company to offer hearing aids to independent hearing aid practitioners additionally intelahear alliance members can also utilize the expertise of iaa in marketing and advertising to potentially increase the member’s units sold per month iaa uses geographical and demographical targeted direct mail campaigns as well as print advertising in local newspapers during a promotional event the goal is for alliance members to work with iaa to create an exclusive and timesensitive promotion for buying devices without the consumer researching their local market for the same product at a cheaper price a common problem for the industry and individual businesses oftentimes the consumer researches the same product and compares prices with other local hearing device retailers on the internet and purchases the hearing device with the cheapest but not always the best hearing aid retailer the company anticipates that the iaa approach combined with intelahear alliance may increase the efficiency of the promotion  the company’s principal business

our chairman accounted for approximately  and  of our sales for the three months ended march   and  respectively and  and  of our sales for the years ended december   and  respectively      iaa is dedicated to serving the retail hearing aid dispensing community through generating traffic and consumer interest for hearing aid dispensing practices whether the practice is small medium or large the company has previously shown an ability to increase the total revenue without increasing cost there are over  retail hearing aid dispensing practices in the united states the company operates in a highly competitive and growing industry the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development of interactive technologies and mediums along with their integration within all offerings has fragmented consumer audiences especially the  age sector which is iaa client’s primary targeted audience these developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a costeffective way causing them to turn to marketing service providers such as iaa for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures   iaa has operated in many major markets across the united states and continues to provide a comprehensive range of services to mfhc grouped into four fundamental disciplines advertisingmarketing customer relationship management crm public relations and specialty communications   management believes the acquisition of intelahear provides the potential for expanding the company’s business model through a potential value proposition to the hearing aid dispenser intelahear future plans will enable independent hearing aid practitioners to leverage the purchasing power of the hearing devices by grouping together and aggregating their purchases this group will be managed by intelahear and be known as the intelahear alliance alliance the potential savings to the member of the alliance may be significant and may increase their operating margin on april   intelahear executed a  year supply agreement with gn hearing care corporation dba as gn resound “gn resound” one of the world’s leading manufacturers of hearing devices this supply agreement enables the company to offer hearing aids to independent hearing aid practitioners   additionally intelahear alliance members can also utilize the expertise of iaa in marketing and advertising to potentially increase the member’s units sold per month iaa uses geographical and demographical targeted direct mail campaigns as well as print advertising in local newspapers during a promotional event the goal is for alliance members to work with iaa to create an exclusive and timesensitive promotion for buying devices without the consumer researching their local market for the same product at a cheaper price a common problem for the industry and individual businesses oftentimes the consumer researches the same product and compares prices with other local hearing device retailers on the internet and purchases the hearing device with the cheapest but not always the best hearing aid retailer the company anticipates that the iaa approach combined with intelahear alliance may increase the efficiency of the promotion   we may raise additional capital by selling shares of our common stock or borrowing funds we have no commitments from any source to provide additional funding there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any or all of the capital required these factors

are an emerging growth company we will not be required to comply with the requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company      following this offering we will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of  the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least  billion as indexed for inflation  the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering under this prospectus  the date on which we have during the previous threeyear period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt and  the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined under the securities exchange act of  as amended which we refer to as the “exchange act”   we also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than  million to the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements       summary of the offering   common stock outstanding before the offering          common stock offered by selling shareholders

stock         the above information regarding common stock to be outstanding after the offering is based on  shares of common stock outstanding as of may     decision to go public   the company’s officers and directors believe that potential investors are more inclined to invest in the company if the company is subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended

securities markets assuming the company finds a market maker in order to have it shares of common stock quoted on one of the tiers of the otc marketplaces our officers and directors believe that the disadvantages of becoming a public company are the continuing reporting costs of being a reporting issuer under the exchange act and reluctance of persons qualified to serve as directors of the company because of director’s exposure to possible legal claims additional disadvantages include the company’s status as an early stage company and management’s limited amount of time that will be

help of their investment accounting legal andor other professional and to make an independent decision regarding an investment in the shares   risks related to our business and our industry   our largest customer moore family hearing company inc “mfhc” accounts for a significant majority of our business and is owned and managed by our directors and officers   mfhc accounted for approximately  and  of our sales for the three months ended march   and  respectively and  and  of our sales for the years ended december   and  respectively a loss of this account would have a significant negative impact on our operations and ability to continue as a going concern our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest   our president mr matthew moore and members of our board of directors own mfhc which could create a conflict of interest   mr moore is the director of marketing of mfhc our chairman is the chief executive officer of mfhc and our treasurer and director is also the chief financial officer and director of mfhc   while we do not expect that our president mr matthew moore or other members of our board of directors will have any material relationships with any companies in the hearing aid advertising industry adverse to us these other affiliations and corporations could cause distraction to mr moore as our president if he focuses a substantial portion of his time on them and the involvement of mr moore with other corporations could cause conflicts of interest with us   these relationships may create conflicts of interest not in the best interest of us or our shareholders from time to time this could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flows   we have incurred losses or minimal profits annually from operations since inception and any losses threaten the company’s ability to remain in business and pursue our business plan   since inception we have generated minimum cumulative profits from operations for the three months ended march   we incurred a net loss of  and for the years ending december   and  we incurred net income of  and a net loss of  respectively and we anticipate incurring additional losses from operating activities in the near future even if we are able to obtain additional equity financing investors have no assurance we will be able achieve profitability in our operations until we achieve break even between revenues and expenses we will remain dependent on obtaining additional debt and equity funding in the event we do not become profitable within a reasonable period of time we may cease operations in which event you will lose your entire investment   a significant part of our business plan depends on marketing of our products and services which may not be accepted in the marketplace   our industry is extremely competitive and we have yet to attain a market share in order to achieve successful operations we will depend on effective marketing to gain a significantly larger market share at the date of this offering we have one employee who devotes their time to marketing we do not engage independent sales representatives we do not employ a marketing agency employing a greater number of marketing personnel or a marketing agency would require greater financial resources than we currently possess furthermore our ability to attract independent sales representatives may be limited without greater name recognition an advertising campaign and market penetration unless we are able to address these limitations in our marketing capabilities you may expect our revenues to be limited and we may have difficulty staying in business and under such circumstances our stock would not gain in value      we operate in and plan to expand into extremely competitive environments which will make it difficult for us to achieve market recognition and revenues   we operate in an extremely competitive environment and the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technologies frequent new product introductions short product life cycles and evolving industry standards our success depends in substantial part on the timely and successful introduction of our new products and services and thereafter upgrades of our products and services to comply with emerging industry standards and to address competing technological and product developments by our competitors we may focus our resources on technologies that do not become widely accepted are not timely released or are not commercially viable in addition our products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after deployment if our products are not competitive or do not work properly our business could suffer and our financial performance could be negatively impacted you have no assurance that our new products and services which we intend to be a significant part or our business will be accepted in the marketplace if our products and services do not achieve market acceptance our revenues will be significantly below the level we anticipate   we are an earlystage company with an unproven business model and our business may not become profitable   we are an earlystage health care company with a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business we have very limited historical financial data as a result of these factors the revenue and income potential of our business is unproven and we have only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and future prospects because of our limited operating history and because the health care industry is rapidly evolving we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends which could harm our business earlystage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as ours frequently encounter risks uncertainties and difficulties including those described in this section we may not be able to successfully address any or all of these risks failure to adequately address such risks could cause our business financial condition results of operations and prospects to suffer   while management believes our current operations differs from our competitors because of the array of marketing and advertising services we provide there will be an added competitive advantage as our future plans pursuant to our acquisition of intelahear depends on developing the alliance business model the alliance business model differs from those of many of our competitors and customers may be reluctant to adopt our model this reluctance may hinder our ability to gain new customers and to expand our business   our revenues are highly susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions   economic downturns could affect the hearing aid industry more severely than other industries and the recovery of the hearing aid industry could lag that of the economy generally in the past some clients have responded to weakening economic conditions with reductions to their purchases of hearing aids in general and marketing budgets specifically which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future a decrease in our revenue could pose a challenge to our cash generation from operations   our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient   if our business is significantly adversely affected by further deterioration in the economic environment or otherwise it could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our needs currently for a noninvestmentgrade company such as ours the capital markets are challenging with limited available financing and at higher costs than in recent years there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all   we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel   our employees including creative research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most important assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and could be adversely affected by our financial or market performance      we currently have only a small management team and staff which could limit iaa’s ability to effectively seize market opportunities and grow our business iaa’s operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in a growing business enterprise including the likelihood of operating losses as a smaller company with a limited operating history iaa’s success will depend among other factors upon how iaa will manage the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the growth of a new business products and channels of distribution and current and future development in addition as a company with a limited operating history iaa has only a small management team and staff to grow iaa’s business and manage the risks inherent in a growing business enterprise these factors could limit iaa’s ability to effectively seize market opportunities and grow iaa’s business we are subject to regulations and other governmental scrutiny that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our revenues   our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign there has been an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer groups to challenge advertising through legislation regulation the courts or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare through the years there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products representatives within government bodies both domestic and foreign continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently our revenues   we will be subject to the periodic reporting requirements of section d of the exchange act that will require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports these additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit   we will be subject to the periodic reporting requirements of section d of the exchange act that will require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports these additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit we will be required to file periodic reports with the sec pursuant to the exchange act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder in order to comply with these requirements our independent registered public accounting firm will have to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis moreover our legal counsel will have to review and assist in the preparation of such reports the costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys however the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit we may be exposed to potential risks resulting from any new requirements under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud our business and operating results could be harmed investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and the trading price of our common stock if a market ever develops could drop significantly   if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed   due to our evolving business model the unpredictability of new markets that we intend to enter and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis      we may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights   the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights we may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others we may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights our technologies may not be able to withstand any thirdparty claims against their use the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain any intellectual property claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive to resolve could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to change our technology change our business practices andor pay monetary damages or enter into short or longterm royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available in the future at the same terms or at all in addition many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results or cash flows or both in a particular quarter   we rely on thirdparty computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service   we will rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our proposed service including database software from oracle corporation and an open source content management system this hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available is identified obtained and integrated which could harm our business any errors or defects in thirdparty hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business     our business could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with their purchase through us or the implementation and customization services provided by third party service providers   our business will depend on our ability to satisfy our potential customers if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product or service the customers dissatisfaction could damage our ability to obtain additional or future orders from that customer in addition potential negative publicity related to our customer relationships regardless of its accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with prospective customers   we are dependent on our president and outsourced consultants and the loss of one or more of these individuals could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner   our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management particularly our president matthew moore we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on our president the loss of the services of our president could seriously harm our business   our president is also the director of marketing of moore family hearing corporation      our future growth may be dependent in part on our distribution arrangements directly with retailers and regional retail accounts if we are unable to establish and maintain these arrangements our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected   our future growth may be dependent in part on our distribution arrangements directly with retailers and regional retail accounts if we are unable to establish and maintain these arrangements our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected we currently have distribution arrangements with a few regional retail accounts to distribute our products directly through their venues however there are several risks associated with this distribution strategy first we do not have longterm agreements in place with any of these accounts and thus the arrangements are terminable at any time by these retailers or us accordingly we may not be able to maintain continuing relationships with any of these national accounts a decision by any of these retailers or any other large retail accounts we may obtain to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition or results of operations in addition we may not be able to establish additional distribution arrangements with other national retailers in addition our dependence on large regional retail chains may result in pressure on us to reduce our pricing to them or seek significant product discounts in general our margins are lower on our sales to these customers because of these pressures any increase in our costs for these retailers to carry our product reduction in price or demand for product discounts could have a material adverse effect on our profit margin   our ability to grow our business may depend on developing a positive brand reputation and member loyalty   establishing and maintaining a positive brand reputation and nurturing member loyalty is critical to attracting new customers we expect to expend reasonable but limited resources to develop maintain and enhance our brand in the near future in addition nurturing customer loyalty will depend on our ability to provide a highquality user experience if we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand reputation and customer satisfaction our ability to attract new customers will be harmed investors may lose their entire investment if we fail to reach profitability      we commenced business in  we have no demonstrable operations record from which you can evaluate the business and its prospects our prospects must be considered in light of the risks uncertainties expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in accomplishing our objectives to date we have incurred losses and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future investors should therefore be aware that they may lose their entire investment in the securities     in order to execute our business plan we may need to raise additional capital if we are unable to raise additional capital we may not be able to achieve our business plan and you could lose your investment   we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings as well as obtain credit from vendors to be able to fully execute our business plan any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute your ownership interest we may not be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain additional funds or credit from our vendors we will be unable to execute our business plan and you could lose your investment management estimates we will need approximately  to fully implement execute and launch our alliance program   we have limited protection of our intellectual property   our business prospects do not rely upon companyowned patented technologies our business prospects will depend largely on our ability to service and support customers and deliver iaa services and solutions there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our trade secrets in the event competitors independently develop or otherwise obtain access to our knowhow concepts or trade secrets we may be adversely affected   purchasers of the shares may incur immediate substantial dilution   purchasers in this offering may incur substantial dilution in the future there is no assurance that our net tangible book value per share in the future will equal or exceed the offering price      litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation   litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation   we may become party to litigation claims and legal proceedings litigation involves significant risks uncertainties and costs including distraction of management attention away from our current business operations we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate if possible the amount of potential losses based on these assessments and estimates we establish reserves andor disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings as appropriate these assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment we caution you that actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with all united states and local laws and regulations applicable to our business operations including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials nonetheless there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will always ensure full compliance by our employees and agents with all applicable legal requirements improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation in the united states and internationally or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines as well as disgorgement of profits   our business model is subject to change   we may elect from time to time to make pricing service hiring and marketing decisions that could increase our expenses affect our revenues and impact our financial results moreover because our expense levels in any given quarter are based in part on management’s expectations regarding future revenues if revenues are below expectations the effect on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for a shortfall in revenues the extent to which expenses are not subsequently followed by increased revenues would harm our operating results and could seriously impair our business   our directors and officers possess the majority of our voting power and through this ownership control our company and our corporate actions   our current officers and directors as a group hold approximately  of the voting power of the outstanding shares immediately after this offering as a result of this substantial ownership in our common stock our officers and directors have a controlling influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets election of directors and other significant corporate actions our officers andor directors may also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control in addition without their consent we could be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us for additional details concerning voting power please refer to the section below entitled “description of securities”   our management team has limited experience managing a public company and regulatory compliance may divert its attention from the daytoday management of our business our management team has limited experience managing a public company and regulatory compliance may divert its attention from the daytoday management of our business some of the individuals who now constitute our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company and limited experience complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our continued transition to a public company that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws in particular these new obligations will require substantial attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the daytoday management of our business which could materially and adversely impact our business operations      we will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company these costs will adversely impact iaa’s results of operations   we are not currently a public company however if iaa becomes a public company iaa will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that a private company does not incur we estimate these costs to be approximately  annually and include the costs associated with having our financial statements prepared audited and filed with the securities and exchange commission “sec” via edgar the electronic data gathering analysis and retrieval system and  xbrl  extensible business reporting language costs in addition we have costs associated with our transfer agent the sarbanesoxley act of  sox and related rules resulted in an increase in costs of maintaining compliance with the public reporting requirements as well as making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors and officers liability insurance these added costs will delay the time in which we may expect to achieve profitability if at all   if we do not effectively manage changes in our business these changes could place a significant strain on our management and operations to manage our growth successfully we must continue to improve and expand our systems and infrastructure in a timely and efficient manner our controls systems procedures and resources may not be adequate to support a changing and growing company if our management fails to respond effectively to changes and growth in our business including acquisitions this could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future prospects   as we attempt to expand our customer base through our marketing efforts our new customers may use our products differently than our existing customers and accordingly our business model may not be as efficient at attracting and retaining new customers   as we attempt to expand our customer base our new customers may use our products differently than our existing customers for example a greater percentage of new customers may take advantage of the free trial period we offer but ultimately choose to use another form of marketing to reach their constituents if our new customers are not as loyal as our existing customers our attrition rate will increase and our customer referrals will decrease which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition as we seek to expand our customer base we expect to increase our spending on sales and marketing activities in order to attract new customers which will increase our operating costs there can be no assurance that these sales and marketing efforts will be successful   us federal legislation entitled controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act of  imposes certain obligations on the senders of commercial emails which could minimize the effectiveness of our email marketing solution and establishes financial penalties for noncompliance which could increase the costs of our business   us

of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act of  or the canspam act which establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content the canspam act among other things obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future emails from the sender in addition some states have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are significantly more punitive and difficult to comply with than the canspam act particularly utah and michigan which have enacted donotemail registries listing minors who do not wish to receive unsolicited commercial email that markets certain covered content such as adult or other harmful products some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the canspam act the ability of our customers’ constituents to opt out of receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of our email marketing solution moreover noncompliance with the canspam act carries significant financial penalties if we were found to be in violation of the canspam act applicable state laws not preempted by the canspam act or foreign laws regulating the distribution of commercial email whether as a result of violations by our customers or if we were deemed to be directly subject to and in violation of these requirements we could be required to pay penalties which would adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business we also may be required to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business which could impair our ability to attract and retain customers or increase our operating costs      government regulation

securities act of  and section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act an emerging growth company egc will lose its egc status upon the earliest of   the last day of the first fiscal year in which the companys annual gross revenues exceed  billion the date on which the company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the exchange act the date on which the company has during the previous threeyear period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt and the last day of the fiscal year in which the fifth anniversary of the companys first sale of equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement occurs   risks related to our common stock and this offering   there is currently no trading market for our common stock and liquidity of shares of our common stock is limited   there is no established public trading market for our securities hence there is no central place such as a stock exchange or electronic trading system to resell your common stock if you want to resell your shares you will have to locate a buyer and negotiate your own sale it is our plan to utilize a market maker who will apply to have our common stock quoted on the over the counter bulletin board in the united states our shares are not and have not been listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system there can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents finra which operates the over the counter bulletin board no can there be any assurance that such an application for quotations will be approved or that a regular trading market will develop or that if developed will be sustained in the absence of a trading market an investor will be unable to liquidate his investment except by private sale   failure to develop or maintain a trading market could negatively affect its value and make it difficult or impossible for you to sell your shares even if a market for common stock does develop the market price of common stock may be highly volatile in addition to the uncertainties relating to future operating performance and the profitability of operations factors such as variations in interim financial results or various as yet unpredictable factors many of which are beyond our control may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock   should our stock become listed on the otc markets if we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements we could be removed from the otc markets which would limit the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities in the secondary market   companies trading on the over the counter bulletin board such as we are seeking to become must be reporting issuers under section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended and must be current in their reports under section  in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the otc markets as a result the market liquidity for our securities could be severely adversely affected by limiting the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market in addition we may be unable to get relisted on the otc markets which may have an adverse material effect on the company      the possible sale of shares of common stock by our selling security holders may have a significant adverse effect on the market price of our common stock should a market develop   the  shares of common stock owned by the selling security holders will be registered with the us securities exchange commission the security holders may sell some or all of their shares immediately after they are registered in the event that the security holders sell some or all of their shares the price of our common stock could decrease significantly   our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our stock in a private placement may be harmed by these competing resales of our common stock by the selling security holders potential investors may not be interested in purchasing shares of our common stock if the selling security holders are selling their shares of common stock the selling of stock by the security holders could be interpreted by potential investors as a lack of confidence in us and our ability to develop a stable market for our stock the price of our common stock could fall if the selling security holders sell substantial amounts of our common stock these sales may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equityrelated securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate because the selling security holders may offer to sell their shares of common stock to potential investors for less than we do   there has been no independent valuation of the stock which means that the stock may be worth less than the purchase price   the per share purchase price has been determined by us without independent valuation of the shares we established the offering price based on our recent sale of stock at  not based on perceived market value book value or other established criteria we did not obtain an independent appraisal opinion on the valuation of the shares the shares may have a value significantly less than the offering price and the shares may never obtain a value equal to or greater than the offering price   we are an ‘emerging growth company” and we intend to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies which could result in our stock being less attractive to investors   we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  which we refer to as the jobs act and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile we expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years   the company’s election to take advantage of the jobs act’s extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily comparable to other companies   pursuant to the jobs act of  as an emerging growth company the company can elect to take advantage of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the public company accounting oversight board pcaob or the securities  exchange commission sec the company has elected take advantage of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies the company as an emerging growth company can adopt the standard on the private company timeframe this may make comparison of the companys financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used   the jobs act will also allow the company to postpone the date by which it must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and reduce the amount of information provided in reports filed with the   the jobs act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on “emerging growth companies the company meets the definition of an emerging growth company and so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company” it will among other things      be exempt from the provisions of section b of the sarbanesoxley act requiring that its independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting be exempt from the “say on pay” provisions requiring a nonbinding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers and the “say on golden parachute” provisions requiring a nonbinding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations of the doddfrank act and certain disclosure requirements of the doddfrank act relating to compensation of its chief executive officer be permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the securities exchange act of  and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation and be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report on the financial statements   the company currently intends to take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to it so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company”   as long as the company qualifies as an emerging growth company the company’s independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting   because the company has elected to take advantage of the extended time periods for compliance with new or revised accounting standards provided for under section b of the jobs act among other things this means that the companys independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting go undetected likewise so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company the company may elect not to provide certain information including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of executive officers that would otherwise have been required to provide in filings with the sec which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate the company as a result investor confidence in the company and the market price of its common stock may be adversely affected   the penny stock rules could restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our shares having a negative effect on our offering   the sec has adopted penny stock regulations which apply to securities traded overthecounter these regulations generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share or an equity security of an issuer with net tangible assets of less than  as indicated in audited financial statements if the corporation has been in continuous operations for less than three years subject to certain limited exceptions the rules for any transaction involving a penny stock require the delivery prior to the transaction of a risk disclosure document prepared by the sec that contains certain information describing the nature and level of risk associated with investments in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities monthly account statements must be sent by the brokerdealer disclosing the estimated market value of each penny stock held in the account or indicating that the estimated market value cannot be determined because of the unavailability of firm quotes in addition the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors generally institutions with assets in excess of  these practices require that prior to the purchase the brokerdealer determined that transactions in penny stocks were suitable for the purchaser and obtained the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction if a market for our common stock does develop and our shares trade below  per share it will be a penny stock consequently the penny stock rules will likely restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our shares and will likely affect the ability of purchasers in the offering to sell our shares in the secondary market trading in our common stock will be subject to the “penny stock” rules due to the thinly traded market of these shares investors are at a much higher risk to lose all or part of their investment not only are these shares thinly traded but they are subject to higher fluctuations in price due to the instability of earnings of these smaller companies as a result of the lack of a highly traded market in our shares investors are at risk of a lack of brokers who may be willing to trade in these shares        we do not expect to pay dividends in the future any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock   we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future the payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant our current intention is to apply net earnings if any in the foreseeable future to increasing our capital base and development and marketing efforts there can be no assurance that the company will ever have sufficient earnings to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our common stock and in any event a decision to declare and pay dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors if we do not pay dividends our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates   the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may decline in value   the market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile as is the stock market in general and the market for otc marketplace quoted stocks in particular  some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control such as changes in financial estimates by industry and securities analysts conditions or trends in the industry in which we operate or sales of our common stock  these factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our performance in addition the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility  this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies  these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock   our stockholders may experience significant dilution if future equity offerings are used to fund operations or acquire complementary businesses   if our future operations or acquisitions are financed through the issuance of equity securities our stockholders could experience significant dilution in addition securities issued in connection with future financing activities or potential acquisitions may have rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of our common stock we also have established an equity incentive plan for our management and employees we expect to grant options to purchase shares of our common stock to our directors employees and consultants and we will grant additional options in the future the issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of these options may result in dilution to our stockholders   our current management can exert significant influence over us and make decisions that are not in the best interests of all stockholders   our executive officers and directors beneficially own as a group approximately  of our outstanding shares of common stock  as a result these stockholders will be able to assert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election and removal of directors and any change in control  in particular this concentration of ownership of our outstanding shares of common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control  this in turn could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock  it could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock  moreover the interests of the owners of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and accordingly could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider      we could issue “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting then current stockholder interests and impairing their voting rights and provisions in our charter documents and under nevada law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable   our certificate of incorporation provides for the authorization to issue up to  shares of “blank check” preferred stock with designations rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors  our board of directors is empowered without stockholder approval to issue one or more series of preferred stock with dividend liquidation conversion voting or other rights which could dilute the interest of or impair the voting power of our common stockholders  the issuance of a series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging delaying or preventing a change in control  for example it would be possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of our company  in addition advanced notice is required prior to stockholder proposals      the securities are highly speculative involve a high degree of risk and no one should purchase the securities who cannot afford the loss of their entire investment prospective investors should carefully review and consider factors set forth under “risk factors” as well as the other information contained in this memorandum before subscribing for any of the securities   in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined in this offering and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties included in the description of our business and elsewhere in this offering the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition and financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks the following risk factors do not include factors or risks which may arise or result from general economic conditions that apply to all businesses in general or risks that could apply to any issuer or any offering   investors who purchase shares of our common stock should be aware of the possibility of a total loss of their investment   an investment in our common stock involves a substantial degree of risk before making an

herein however may not reflect all of the risks associated with our business or an investment in our common stock you should invest in our company only if you can afford to lose your entire investment   the financial industry regulatory authority or finra sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock   in addition to the penny stock rules described above finra has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer a brokerdealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending speculative lowpriced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares   a significant amount of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock are restricted securities and may not be freely resold to the public when the restriction on any or all of these shares is lifted and the shares are sold in the open market the price of our common stock could be adversely affected   a significant amount of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock are restricted securities as defined under rule  promulgated under the securities act of  as amended and may only be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration if available although rule  may not be immediately available to permit resale of such shares once available and given the number of shares that would no longer be restricted sales of shares by our shareholders whether pursuant to rule  or otherwise could have an immediate negative effect upon the price of our common stock      our customer base is highly concentrated a default from our largest customer a related party could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and future prospects in addition a significant reduction in demand for our services from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on demand for our advertising services and our financial performance   our customer base is highly concentrated a default from our largest customer a related party could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and future prospects in addition a significant reduction in demand for our services from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on demand for our services and our financial performance our largest customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues our largest customer a related party represented approximately  and  of our revenues for the three months ended march   and  respectively and  and  of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively given the high concentration of our customer base a default or loss of our largest customer would result in a major reduction in our revenues and a material adverse impact on our performance and financial condition in addition the loss or significant reduction in orders from any of our major customers could materially reduce the demand for our services and result in lower revenues higher operating expenses and diminished growth prospects   cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements   certain statements contained in this

the united states the company operates in a highly competitive and growing industry the proliferation of media channels including the rapid development of interactive technologies and mediums along with their integration within all offerings has fragmented consumer audiences especially the  age sector which is iaa client’s primary targeted audience these developments make it more complex for

services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures      iaa has operated in many major markets including dallas houston san antonio minneapolis tampa orlando los angeles

views the value proposition resulting from enabling independent hearing aid practitioners to combine the purchasing power of the hearing devices by grouping together and aggregating their purchases this group will be managed by intelahear and be known as the intelahear alliance alliance the potential resulting savings to the members of the alliance may be significant and can increase their operating margin in anticipation of this future growth plan intelahear executed a  year supply agreement on april nd  with one of the world’s leading manufacturers of hearing devices gn resound this supply agreement gives intelahear complete and total control to resell their hearing devices at any price mandated by intelahear this agreement enables intelahear to offer hearing aids to independent hearing aid practitioners at an average savings of  while the company will earn approximately  of the member’s purchases   additionally intelahear alliance members can also utilize the expertise of iaa in marketing and advertising to increase the member’s units sold per month iaa will be using geographical and demographical targeted direct mail campaigns as well as print advertising in the local newspapers during a promotional event iaa promotional campaigns have previously shown the company’s clients favorable returns on investment oftentimes producing  to  times roi some of the highest rois in the industry the goal is for alliance members to work with iaa to create an exclusive and timesensitive promotion for buying intelahear devices without the consumer researching their local market for the same product at a cheaper price a common problem for the industry and individual businesses oftentimes the consumer researches the same product and compares prices with other local hearing device retailers on the internet and purchases the hearing device with the cheapest but not always the best hearing aid retailer this process can decrease the average sales price and overall revenue during an iaa promotion the company expects that the iaa approach combined with intelahear alliance will increase the efficiency of the promotion by more than  currently there are no members of this

company is targeting to launch the alliance in the fourth quarter of  the alliance will setup members at no additional cost in all large and medium sized markets around the united states to sell private label hearing devices that are manufactured and shipped by gn resound located in bloomington mn through the alliance the member will be able to purchase product directly from gn resound at a discount to the price that same retailer can purchase the same product gn resound will be billing and collecting for all hearing aids sold to the member under the pricing arrangement agreed to by the member and the alliance resound and the alliance on a monthly basis will calculate the difference between the member price and the alliance price the “rebate” resound will then pay the rebate to the company on a monthly basis the company will recognize the rebate as revenue in the month the rebate is earned gn resound will not charge any fees associated with the collecting or distribution of the margin between the member’s price and the alliance’s price alliance marketing plan   the alliance marketing plan is divided into  distinct phases    st phase the alliance will focus on grass roots campaign through word of mouth with industry leaders which have private practice contacts that are currently searching for a group to help them navigate through these challenging times    nd phase using social media like linkedin the alliance will make connections with private practices decision makers that are not currently tied into a single manufacture or a supply arrangement with a hearing device manufacture    rd phase recruit outside manufacture representatives that are already located in the geographic territories where the alliance desires to expand these outside manufacture representatives would have local knowledge and resources to find and convert existing practices to the alliance    th phase gn resound as the exclusive supplier of hearing devices to the alliance members is willing to offer a select few of their  bb client base an opportunity to join the alliance the alliance will work closely with gn resound to effectuate this opportunity   alliance service offering   the alliance program enables independent hearing aid practitioners to leverage their collective purchasing power of the hearing devices by grouping together and aggregating their purchases through the alliance the resulting savings to the members customers of the alliance could be significant and generate increases to their operating margin on march   the company executed a  year supply agreement with gn resound one of the world’s leading manufacturers of hearing devices this supply agreement grants the company the right to receive the net difference between the price the alliance negotiates with the alliance member retailer to purchase product directly from gn resound and the cost that the company has negotiated with gn resound pursuant to the agreement typical cost of goods for a hearing health care practice is around  only by joining the alliance would independent retailers be able to obtain a reduced cost as all orders received by gn resound from the alliance receive additional discounts that an individual retailer would not be eligible for this additional discount apples to resound labeled products as well as intela hear branded products an alliance member practice may see a decrease of their cost of goods to around  while still enabling the company to make a profit of the net margin on the sales which will be paid directly to the company by gn resound gn resound will collect all account receivables from the alliance dealer and on a monthly basis gn resound will pay the difference of the full alliance discounted price and the alliance members discounted price there is no fee or cost for retailers to join the alliance    the agreement also offers the company a significant discount of single unit pricing from gn resound on all of their current hearing devices and future hearing devices including the entrylevel product wherein gn resound has committed to an even greater discount the alliance will primarily offer  levels for the alliance members and  additional exclusive tier in the network the first level offers the alliance member a  discount off the single unit price from resound if they purchase less than  units per month from alliance these units could be the intelahear label or resound labeled hearing device all units except the entrylevel hearing device would qualify for the  business development fund hereinafter “bdf” this bdf will calculate on the alliance accounting side at the end of each month the alliance will produce a statement to the alliance member the alliance will be fully responsible for reimbursing the bdf to the alliance members the second level offers the alliance member a  discount if they purchase more than  units per month from alliance plus the  bdf on all units except for the entry level hearing devices the exclusive tier will be called the “founders” this super exclusive tier will be for the elite few businesses that can produce over  units per month for the alliance the founders tier will receive a  discount plus the  bdf on all units except for the entry level hearing devices this tier would also be used to convert respected and well known audiological practices to the intelahear alliance to help spread the word about the alliance to other practices across the country all founders will sign a confidentially and nondisclosure agreements about their practice being in the founders tier   marketing support   another significant benefit for the alliance members will be marketing support iaa will be the marketing arm for the alliance and all members will have access to the lowest cost of direct mail marketing in the industry and timetested marketing materials for direct mail and newspaper advertisements this benefit could increase an alliance member’s practice to new levels or help the alliance become more efficient and cost effective business the alliance will be creating a business development fund bdf for every alliance member created from their monthly hearing device purchases from the alliance group the alliance will contribute  of the monthly total or net paid hearing instruments purchased through the member’s alliance account every month and deposited into a bdf to be used or credited toward that member’s future marketingadvertising the alliance provides an exclusive and protected territory this insures that no competitors in the member’s market area has the right to sell or use the alliance’s private label brand hearing instruments the alliance’s proprietary programming software only authorized alliance businesses can program the hearing instruments any marketing advertising or price strategies exclusive to only alliance businesses   the company’s exclusive arrangement with resound allows each practice to decide whether a private label strategy using an alliance brand is right for their practice or if a combination of both resound label and private label hearing instruments may be the right choice the alliance offers both choices with the same discount levels unless a retailer is a member of the alliance the discount of purchasing either an alliance branded device or a resound hearing device will not be available the alliance will use high value packaging and collateral materials all of the hearing instruments are delivered to the patient in a branded proprietary zippered fabric case which includes a drying cup cleaning spray ear gel cleaning wipes brushpick magnet combo with a vent brush all of the alliance’s high quality hearing instruments are fully supported with quality customer brochures as well as a consumer based website wwwintelahearcom  the alliance will also offer to the members the very successful “patient journey process” this process has been developed by the leading experts in the industry to help the members with increasing efficacy and patient care this could help to reduce the hearing device return rate the patient journey process is approximately a six week program to insure that each individual personalized for their assessment and expectations receives the most benefit from their treatment the process includes the selection process delivery of the device fitting and setting the base level and success parameters weekly training and audibility verification through speech mapping equipment and concludes with a fitting and followup chart and checklist    competition   we have numerous direct indirect and partial competitors many of which have valuable industry relationships and access to greater resources than we do there is no assurance that we will be able to produce a product that will be competitive in the marketplace and even if competitive that we will be able to earn a profit   the numerous types of direct or indirect competitors that exist in the market today include but may not be limited to sales and marketing firms marketing consultants design services ad agencies media buying firms internet marketing firms online social media firms and others key competitors include chicago advertising  marketing cam a leader in direct marketing for the hearing aid industry since  beeman marketing a marketing firm specializing in hearing care practitioners and audiologists since  and nutshell marketing a high quality direct response marketing firm specialized in targeting  and older age group   the alliance faces competition from major retail distributors andor networks there is a rapid growth of manufacturerowned retail stores major consolidation has taken place in the us market by the hearing aid manufacturers in the last few years with almost every manufacturer participating in buying out other smaller manufacturers resulting in many different brand labels controlled under the same parent company umbrella this consolidation has allowed the manufacturers to increase and control more of their distribution by offering different levels in their product lines throughout their different brands  this has also allowed the manufacturers to implement different price strategies for the same technology throughout their brands  this consolidation has not only increased their market share but also increased their profit margins   the internet is fast becoming a major factor in the distribution of hearing aids in the us numerous small companies are on the internet advertising hearing aids for the cheapest price and the largest hearing aid manufacturer sonova which owns hearingplanet is most prominent among these online offerings however internet sales still require the participation of a local practitioner for testing and fitting this limits the widespread geographic appeal of internet sales   technology and development   iaa is equipped with three  g macpros and one  imac which are uptodate with the

local laws and regulation applied to businesses such as payroll taxes on the state and federal levels our current business requires that we comply with state corporate filings city or county business license and the necessary business liability insurance the requirements of these regulations are minimal and do not cause any undue burden   internet access and online services are not subject to direct regulation in the united states changes in the laws and regulations relating to the telecommunications and media industry however could impact our business for example the federal communications commission could begin to regulate the internet and online service industry which could result in increased costs for us the laws and regulations applicable to the internet and to our services are evolving and unclear and could damage our business there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to or commerce on the internet due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted covering issues such as user privacy defamation pricing taxation content regulation quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement such legislation could expose us to substantial liability as well as dampen the growth in use of the internet decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications and commercial medium or require us to incur significant expenses in complying with any new regulations   employees   as of march   iaa employs fourteen  outbound

been no nominations of additional directors proposed in the event such a proposal is made all current members of our board will participate in the consideration of director nominees   as with most small early stage companies until such time as our company further develops our business achieves a revenue base and has sufficient working capital to purchase directors’ and officers’ insurance we do not have any immediate prospects to attract independent directors when we are able to expand our board to include one or more independent directors we intend to establish an audit committee of our board of directors it is our intention that one or more of these independent directors will also qualify as an audit committee financial expert our securities are not quoted on an exchange that has requirements that a majority of our board members be independent and we are not currently otherwise subject to any law rule or regulation requiring that all or any portion of our board of directors include “independent” directors nor are we required to establish or maintain an audit committee or other committee of our board   conflicts of interests   our largest customer moore family hearing

could create a conflict of interest mr moore is the director of marketing of mfhc our chairman is the chief executive officer of mfhc and our treasurer and director is also the chief financial officer and director of mfhc these affiliations with mfhc could cause distraction to our officers and directors if they focus a substantial portion of their time on mfhc this involvement with mfhc could potentially create conflicts of interest not in the best interest of our shareholders or us from time to time   code of ethics   upon the closing of this offering we will adopt a code of business

hereby will be passed upon for us by anderson hayes pc rancho santa fe ca   experts   the financial statements of innerscope advertising agency inc as of december   and for the years ended december   and  included in this prospectus have been included herein in reliance on the report by d brooks and associates cpa’s pa our independent public accounting firm given on the authority that the firm are experts in accounting and auditing     market price of and dividends on the company’s common equity and related stockholder matters   there is currently no market for our securities we cannot give you any assurance that the shares you purchase will ever have a market or that if a market for our shares ever develops that you will be able to sell your shares in addition even if a public market for our shares develops there is no assurance that a secondary public market will be sustained   the shares you purchase are not traded or listed on any exchange we will seek to have a market maker file an application with the financial industry regulatory authority or finra for our common stock to be eligible for trading on the otc markets after this registration statement is declared effective by the sec as of the date of this registration statement we do not have a market maker who has agreed to file such application moreover even assuming we do identify such a market maker it could take several months before the market maker’s listing application for our shares is approved there can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with finra which operates the otc markets nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved   the otc markets is maintained by otc market group inc the securities traded on the otc markets are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange instead these securities transactions are conducted by telephone and through a computer network connecting dealers in stocks overthecounter stocks are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange      even if our shares are quoted on the otc markets a purchaser of our shares may not be able to resell the shares brokerdealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in our shares because they will be considered penny stocks and will be subject to the penny stock rules rules g through g promulgated under the exchange act impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on finra brokersdealers who make a market in a “penny stock” a penny stock generally includes any nonnasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than  per share under the penny stock regulations a brokerdealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or “accredited investor” generally an individual with net worth in excess of  or an annual income exceeding  or  together with his or her spouse must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale unless the brokerdealer or the transactions is otherwise exempt in addition the penny stock regulations require the brokerdealer to deliver prior to any transaction involving a penny stock a disclosure schedule prepared by the commission relating to the penny stock market unless the brokerdealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt a brokerdealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the brokerdealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities finally a brokerdealer is required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer’s account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks   the additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon brokersdealers may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in our shares which could severely limit the market liquidity of the shares and impede the sale of our shares in the secondary market assuming one develops   should a market develop for our shares the trading price of the common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results changes in financial estimates by securities analysts announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures capital commitments additions or departures of key personnel sales of common stock and other events or factors many of which are beyond our control in addition the stock market in general as experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of the common stock regardless of our operating performance consequently future announcements concerning us or our competitors litigation or public concerns as to the commercial value of one or more of our products or services may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially for reasons which may be unrelated to operating results these fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock   at the present time we have no outstanding options or warrants to purchase securities convertible into common stock   cash dividends have not been paid during the last three  years in the near future we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us are subject to the discretion of our board of directors any future determination to pay cash dividends will depend on our results of operations financial condition capital requirements contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant at the time by the board of directors we are not currently subject to any contractual arrangements that restrict our ability to pay cash dividends   we have twentyeight  stockholders of record of our common stock as of december        impact of the “penny stock” rules on buying or selling our common stock   the sec has adopted penny stock regulations which apply to securities traded overthecounter these regulations generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share or an equity security of an issuer with net tangible assets of less than  as indicated in audited financial statements if the corporation has been in continuous operations for less than three years subject to certain limited exceptions the rules for any transaction involving a penny stock require the delivery prior to the transaction of a risk disclosure document prepared by the sec that contains certain information describing the nature and level of risk associated with investments in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities monthly account statements must be sent by the brokerdealer disclosing the estimated market value of each penny stock held in the account or indicating that the estimated market value cannot be determined because of the unavailability of firm quotes in addition the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors generally institutions with assets in excess of  these practices require that prior to the purchase the brokerdealer determined that transactions in penny stocks were suitable for the purchaser and obtained the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction if a market for our common stock does develop and our shares trade below  per share it will be a penny stock consequently the penny stock rules will likely restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our shares and will likely affect the ability of purchasers in the offering to sell our shares in the secondary market   trading in our common stock will be subject to the “penny stock” rules   this section of the registration statement includes a number of forwardlooking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance forwardlooking statements are often identified by words like believe expect estimate anticipate intend project and similar expressions or words which by their nature refer to future events you should not place undue certainty on these forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this prospectus   critical accounting policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap the consolidated financial statements of the company include the consolidated accounts of innerscope and its’ wholly owned subsidiaries illc and intelahear a california limited liability company all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation    use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   revenue recognition   upon the generation of revenue the company shall follow the guidance of the securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin  for revenue recognition the company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement that the services have been rendered to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured subscription revenues shall be recognized over the period benefited deferred revenues shall be recorded when cash has been collected however the related service has not yet been provided      going concern   the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern during the three months ended march   the company had a net loss of  and used cash of  from operations the company is dependent on the marketing agreement with mfhc common control these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   income taxes   the company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases a valuation allowance can be provided for a net deferred tax asset due to uncertainty of realization   net loss per common share   net loss per common share is computed pursuant to asc no  earnings per share basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during each period there were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of march     recently issued accounting pronouncements   the company reviewed all recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging issues task force the aicpa and the sec and they did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the companys present or future financial statements   experienced and dedicated personnel   we intend to maintain a highly competitive team of experienced and technically proficient employees and motivate them through a positive work environment and stock ownership we believe that employee ownership which may be encouraged through a stock option plan is essential for attracting retaining and motivating qualified personnel while we have not yet adopted a stock option plan we intend to do so in the near future   election under jobs act of    we have chosen to optin and make use of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section b of the jobs act of    jumpstart our business startups act   in april  the jumpstart our business startups act jobs act was enacted into law the jobs act provides among other things   exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies   amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of       relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for rule  offerings adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding  million and exemption from registration by a nonreporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to  that comply with rules to be adopted by the sec pursuant to section  of the securities act and exemption of such sales from state law registration documentation or offering requirements   in general under the jobs act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering ipo of common equity securities was effected after december   and the company had less than  billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year a company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of   i the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of  billion or more ii the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the companys ipo iii the companys issuance of more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior threeyear period or iv the company becoming a larger accelerated filer as defined under the securities exchange act of    the jobs act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for nonreporting companies and for nonpublic offerings those exemptions that impact the company are discussed below   financial disclosure  the financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the securities act of  will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows   i audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years ii selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited iii executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies a smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less than  million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter   however the requirements for financial disclosure provided by regulation sk promulgated by the rules and regulations of the sec already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies we are a smaller reporting company currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations   the jobs act also exempts our independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the public company accounting oversight board pcaob after the date of the jobs acts enactment except as otherwise required by sec rule   the jobs act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the pcaob for mandatory rotation of our accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit   internal control attestation  the jobs act also provides an exemption from the requirement of our independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on our internal control over financial reporting although our management is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the companys internal control over financial reporting   section a of the jobs act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in §ae of the securities exchange act of  for companies with a class of securities registered under the  act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes   other items of the jobs act  the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement the act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision in addition the jobs act precludes the sec and finra from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers dealers and potential investors communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company ipo      section  of the jobs act permits emerging growth companies to submit  act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least  days before the issuer conducts any road show this is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the ipo option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow   election to opt out of transition period  section b of the jobs act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies that is those that have not had a  act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the  act are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard   the jobs act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to nonemerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable the company has elected not to opt out of the transition period and will “optin” and make use of the transitional period   dilution   while there will be no dilution to existing shareholders from the resale offering dilution may occur in the event we chose to raise capital through a private offering or debt financing   the issuance of further shares and the eligibility of further issued shares for resale will dilute our common stock and may lower the price of our common stock if you invest in our common stock your interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the price per share you pay for the common stock and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock at the time of sale we calculate net tangible book value per share by calculating the total assets less intangible assets and total liabilities and dividing it by the number of outstanding shares of common stock   in the future we may issue additional shares options and warrants and we may grant stock options to our officers employees directors and consultants under a stock option plan all of which may further dilute our net tangible book value   off balance sheet arrangements   we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors the term “offbalance sheet arrangement” generally means any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party under which we have i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract derivative instrument or variable interest or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit liquidity or market risk support for such assets   pursuant to the jobs act of  as an emerging growth company we elected to opt into the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the pcaob or the sec we elected utilize such extended transition periods which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies we as an emerging growth company can adopt the standard for the private company this may make comparison of our financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used   although we are still evaluating the jobs act we currently intend to take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to it so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company”    changes in and disagreements with accountants   we have not had any disagreements with our accountants     director independence   our board of directors is currently composed of three members who do not qualify as independent directors in accordance with the published listing requirements of the nasdaq global market the nasdaq independence definition includes a series of objective tests such as that the director is not and has not been for at least three years one of our employees and that neither the director nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us in addition our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which in the opinion of our board of directors would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director though such subjective determination is required by the nasdaq rules had our board of directors made these determinations our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each directors business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management     transfer agent and registrar   the current transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is vstock transfer llc   spruce street suite  cedarhurst new york  telephone  until the present time we have acted as our own transfer agent and registrar   limitations on liability and indemnification of officers and directors   our certificate of incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director to the fullest extent permitted by nevada revised statutes our certificate of incorporation also provides that we must indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by nevada law and advance expenses to our directors and officers in connection with a legal proceeding subject to certain exceptions we are in the process of obtaining directors and officers insurance for our directors officers and some employees for specified liabilities   the limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty they may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers even though an action of this kind if successful might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders furthermore a stockholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions however we believe that these indemnification provisions are necessary to attract and retain qualified directors and officers   disclosure of commission position on indemnification for securities act liabilities   insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act may be permitted to directors officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise we have been advised that in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act and is therefore unenforceable      available information   we have filed a registration statement on form s under the securities act of  as amended relating to the shares of common stock being offered by this prospectus and reference is made to such registration statement this prospectus constitutes the prospectus of innerscope advertising agency inc filed as part of the registration statement and it does not contain all information in the registration statement as certain portions have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission   our fiscal year ends december  we plan to furnish our shareholders annual reports containing audited financial statements and other appropriate reports where applicable you may read and copy any reports statements and other information we file at the sec’s public reference room at  f street ne washington dc  you can request copies of these documents upon payment of a duplicating fee by writing to the sec please call the sec at sec for further information on the operation of the public reference room our sec filings are also available to the public on the sec’s internet site at httpwww secgov   we are not required by nevada law to provide annual reports at the request of a shareholder we will send a copy of an annual report to include audited financial statements in the event we become a reporting company with the sec we will file all necessary quarterly and annual reports   penny stock considerations   our shares will be penny stocks  as that term is generally defined in the securities exchange act of  to mean equity securities with a price of less than   thus our shares will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock   under the penny stock regulations a brokerdealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the sale unless the brokerdealer is otherwise exempt   in addition under the penny stock regulations the brokerdealer is required to   deliver prior to any transaction involving a penny stock a disclosure schedule prepared by the securities and exchange commission relating to the penny stock market unless the brokerdealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt disclose commissions payable to the brokerdealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer’s account the account’s value and information regarding the limit market in penny stocks and make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer’s account   because of these regulations brokerdealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market these additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities if our securities become publicly traded in addition the liquidity for our securities may be decreased with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our shareholders will in all likelihood find it difficult to sell their securities        financial statements   index to financial

based on our audits we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement the company is not required to have nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting accordingly we express no such opinion an audit also includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion we were not engaged to examine management’s assertion about the effectiveness of
