for joining us today i am pleased to report that we had another excellent quarter we continue to remain on track to deliver a solid  and progress toward our  longterm vision for profitable growth that includes a target of  million in revenue and  in operating margin slide  outlines our recently published financial results for the third quarter of  and provides comparison versus the third quarter of  total net sales increased  to  million this increase was primarily driven by our recent acquisition of texel which we closed on july   with respect to profitability gross margin expanded by  basis points to  and adjusted gross margin expanded  basis points to  operating margin increased by  basis points to  and adjusted operating margin increased by  basis points to  adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter was  up  basis points from the same period in  overall our very strong performance reflects the benefits of favorable product mix cost absorption on incremental sales and favorable material pricing and productivity diluted earnings per share of  an increase of  from third quarter of  and adjusted earnings per share were up nearly  to a companyrecord of  per share with respect to the ongoing investigation related to the possible violations of german antitrust laws we continue to communicate with the german federal cartel office while we anticipate bringing this matter to conclusion sometime in fourth quarter of  were unfortunately still unable to estimate the specific timing or quantify the liability turning to slide  this is an overview of our longterm growth strategy which includes four drivers new product development lean six sigma geographic expansion and ma first with respect to ma our recent acquisition of texel is an exciting addition to our portfolio leveraging traditional strong seasonal demand the business had an excellent quarter contributing  million in revenue and adjusted operating margin of approximately  integration of the business into our newly renamed technical nonwovens segment is on track and i am confident that we will continue to deliver on our plans as i have mentioned before even with the acquisition and ongoing integration of texel both from a financial and organizational resource perspective we continue to have the means the wherewithal and the desire to execute on additional acquisitions and to continue to actively pursue new opportunities with respect to lydall lean six sigma we are continually focusing on driving operational efficiency and ways to better serve our customers during the third quarter of  we continued to make progress in resolving the previously mentioned platform launch inefficiencies in our thermalacoustical metals segment that had a significant impact on our second quarter  results the team is taking a disciplined approach to understanding the root cause and implement corrective actions through kaizen activity we expect this work to continue into early  in terms of international growth rampup of our thermalacoustical metals facility in china continues to progress and we anticipate achieving breakeven in operating income for the full year of  the third quarter was the second period in a row in which the operation delivered positive operating income and we continue to be encouraged by the outlook into early  finally with respect to new product development all of our segments are focused on developing solutions to better serve our customers for example while it is still too early to judge the ultimate longterm success we are encouraged by increasing demand for our premium vehicle cabin air filtration product in our performance materials segment this composite product provides ultrahigh efficiency filtration using our proprietary arioso membrane technology turning to slide  with respect to business conditions we believe the underlying fundamentals of our business remain solid and expect to have another great year as pockets of strength are expected to offset the few pockets of softness that we are seeing within our automotive businesses current visibility suggests that overall global demand remains stable despite flat industry forecasts for light vehicle production in north america and europe we anticipate that we will grow in excess of the market primarily driven by share gains within our thermalacoustical metals segment for those of you who follow us closely your are aware that ford is a key customer in our thermalacoustical fibers segment where we primarily serve suv and pickup truck platforms in midoctober ford publicly announced that they would be reducing production at some of their facilities producing the platforms we serve while we have seen our forecasted demand from this customer soften marginally we expect the fourth quarter for this segment to increase both yearoveryear and sequentially from the last quarter given our increased content and share gains in performance materials segment while we have lapped the decline that began last year from a reporting perspective we anticipate demand for cryogenic insulation products to remain weak due to continued softness in the liquid natural gas markets in the life sciences filtration we have largely concluded the termination buys that have benefited us yeartodate and as such anticipate the demand on these highmargin products returning to a normalized level on the filtration side of the business we remain encouraged we continue to see signs of improving demand in north american filtration market and in particular successes in fluid power applications given new product introductions finally our technical nonwovens segment while we continue to benefit from stable demand in nonfiltration products we continue to face weakness from domestic power generation customers and experience general softness in china for filtration related products while we have seen a modest increase in bid activity and have won awards recently we dont anticipate significant change in these markets in the fourth quarter from prior periods with regard to texel we expect demand in the fourth quarter to moderate sequentially given normal seasonality to wrap up my comments we have had an excellent performance in both our third quarter and yeartodate we look forward to turning it into another exceptional year and delivering solid financial performance for all of  with that i will now turn the call over to scott scott m deakin thank you dale and good morning today ill briefly cover our consolidated results and then provide an overview of our operating segment results turning to slide  in our third quarter of  the company achieved net sales of  million an increase of  over the third quarter of  this increase was primarily driven by texel organic growth for the quarter was  this was primarily the result of strength in two of our segments thermalacoustical metals and performance materials up  and  respectively being offset by a  decline in our technical nonwovens segment the organic growth in our thermalacoustical metals segment was driven by platform share gains on products launched earlier this year performance materials organic growth was primarily due to continued recovery in filtration markets share gains and termination buys in life sciences our technical nonwovens segment experienced continued weakness from domestic power generation customers and general softness in china in addition to the organic sales decline of  this segment experienced headwind of  due to unfavorable foreign currency translation consolidated gross margin in the quarter increased  basis points to  versus the third quarter of  driven primarily by favorable mix lower raw material cost and cost absorption on the incremental sales adjusted gross margin improved  basis points to  consolidated operating margin increased  basis points to  with adjusted operating margin of  an increase of  basis points over the prior year the effective tax rate for the quarter was  compared to  in the third quarter of  we anticipate that our effective rate going forward will fall in low s third quarter  diluted earnings per share were  an increase of  versus the third quarter of  adjusted earnings per share were up nearly  to a companyrecord of  a share moving to the balance sheet our liquidity continues to remain very strong at the end of the third quarter cash was  million which is net of the  million used in the beginning of the third quarter to partially funding acquisition of texel our leverage ratio was x and we have availability for additional borrowings of approximately  million from our credit facility finally as it relates to capital expenditures we spent approximately  million through the first nine months of the year compared to  million in the prior year for the fullyear  we expect total capital expenditures to be in the range of  million to  million turning to slide  ill note the progress we have made yeartodate through the first nine months sales of  million were up organically by  excluding technical nonwovens the remaining segments have experienced nearly  organic growth the yeartodate organic sales decline of  in the technical nonwovens segment offset this growth a result of marked weakness from power generation customers and general softness in china with respect to operating margin we continue to make progress on improving profitability adjusted operating margin increased  basis points to  versus the adjusted operating margin for the same period of  the continued improvements of the consolidated level are driven primarily by favorable mix and lower raw material costs across the business moving to slide  ill discuss our segment results ill start with our thermalacoustical metals business this is our global automotive segment that specializes in providing underhood and underbody engineered thermal solutions for vehicles this business delivered strong organic sales growth of  during the quarter part sales increased  million to  million or  compared to the same period in the prior year this increase in part sales was driven by platform share wins in north america as well as china tooling sales were up slightly in the third quarter of  given the timing of product launches operating margin increased  basis points quarteronquarter to  driven by favorable product mix and lower raw material cost during the quarter we made progress in addressing the previously mentioned platform launch inefficiencies in north america and europe but expect them to continue into early  on increased scale our china facility generated favorable operational efficiencies and delivered positive operating margin for the second quarter in a row we expect to achieve at least breakeven in operating income in this operation for the full year  slide  refers to our thermalacoustical fibers business this business also serves the automotive industry and provides molded polyester acoustical solutions primarily for underbody applications for vehicles in north america sales in the third quarter were  million up  versus the same period in the prior year with the timing of tooling sales driving most of this growth part sales were essentially flat quarteronquarter as we saw the rampup of our onepiece molded flooring product line offset by otherwise lower demand this lower demand was primarily due to planned summer shutdowns at key oems returning to lengths more consistent with prior experience versus the shortened levels we experienced in the third quarter of  operating margin in this segment decreased  basis points quarteronquarter to  this was primarily due to unfavorable product mix particularly as it relates to a greater amount of lower margin tooling sales with slightly higher labor and overhead costs for the third quarter of  compared to the same period in the prior year moving to slide  ill cover our performance materials segment that provides specialty filtration and insulation products to a variety of end markets globally sales in the third quarter were  million or a  increase organically versus the same period last year the business continues to realize strong market demand and was further able to increase share primarily in filtration which grew  in the third quarter particularly with our fluid power and transport hydraulic filtration products thermal insulation overall grew  despite our continuing to see softness in energyrelated application as our cryogenic insulation products are sold into liquid natural gas infrastructure markets life sciences filtration increased by  primarily due to the conclusion of the termination buys by certain customers which were driven by a discontinuation of certain raw materials used in the production process third quarter sales include  million of termination buys and on a yeartodate basis these buys totaled  million segmentlevel operating margin in the third quarter improved by  basis points to  this improvement was driven by leverage on the increased sales absorption benefit from the life sciences buys favorable mix offset by unfavorable material productivity slide  covers our technical nonwovens segment as we have previously communicated this is the first quarter in which we are reporting our results under this segment name which now reflects the combined performance for both our legacy industrial filtration business as well as our recent acquisition of texel sales of the combined business are now reflected in two product groupings first industrial filtration which includes the air and liquid filtration sales from both businesses and second advanced materials which includes all other products for use in the various commercial applications such as geosynthetics automotive industrial and medical among others in the third quarter of  sales of  million were up over  primarily due to  million of sales contributed by texel unfavorable foreign currency translation primarily associated with weakening of the british pound impacted sales by  net of these items on an organic basis sales were down  primarily due to continued weakness from domestic power generation customers and general softness in china from a profitability perspective the technical nonwovens adjusted operating margin for the third quarter of  increased by  basis points to  compared to the same period in  included in these results is  million or  basis points of acquisition related intangible amortization expense the increase in adjusted operating margin was due to favorable product mix as lower raw material costs were offset by customer pricing reductions as dale mentioned earlier the performance of texel in the third quarter was strong fully meeting our expectations to date the adjusted operating results for texel were accretive to the overall performance of the segment as the third quarter is one of the strongest periods for that business given normal seasonality that concludes our review of lydalls third quarter results to wrap up our comments i will reiterate dales earlier remarks lydall has delivered excellent performance in the third quarter as well as yeartodate we continue to look forward to turning in another exceptional year with that i will turn the call back to the operator to begin our questionandanswer session questionandanswer session operator operator instructions the first question today comes from robert majek from cjs securities please go ahead robert majek its great to see auto parts revenue up  yearoveryear with industry auto sales flat to down in the quarter i guess going forward over the next few quarters can you just give us a little more color on the number or magnitude of new platform and product launches that may result in further incremental growth dale g barnhart some of the key ones that we have mentioned earlier in the year is the flooring product that we have that actually launched in september and will be ramping up while on the ford super duty line of pickup trucks in addition to that theres several products in the metals business that we are going through the rampup process right now that will continue into  robert majek thank you and on texel could you just give us an update on your synergy expectations there in  or  and what it will take to get there scott m deakin as we talked about when we first did the acquisition a lot of those synergy impacts are ones that you wont see in  were really just focusing on integration activities there as we start to go forward in that business were really starting to leverage our global footprint so the sales that that business is experiencing well be able to really utilize the assets across all of the technical nonwovens business were already seeing encouraging conversations between texel business and our performance materials business in terms of extending some of the products of their respective businesses into their respective markets and then were starting to explore the opportunities that we see on the purchasing side in terms of leveraging consolidated buy throughout the operations so i would say clearly the integration in terms of just the base integration kind of activities are going very well and all of the synergy related kind of things that we talked about when we first did the acquisition back in july are right on track robert majek thank you and then on performance materials filtration can you just give us a little more color on the share gains youve been experiencing there whats driving that and is that due to new products dale g barnhart we look at their two different market segments or areas geographic regions in europe we had an exceptional year last year weve continued to experience that this year and a lot of that is share of wallet we have gained with our major customers in europe in north america again some share gains with our existing air filtration customers and then weve been successful in introducing some new product lines in our fluid power area for liquid filtration so those are the primary drivers in filtration robert majek and lastly from me how should we think about normal seasonality in the texel business going forward scott m deakin id say clearly the third quarter somewhat the second quarter but the third quarter is clearly the strongest as we said in our introductory remarks youll definitely see some tempering of that market particularly on the geosynthetic side of the business which you can kind of understand is really product that is focused on outdoor applications which soften in the winter and colder months so well see dampening in the ballpark of  or so in the fourth quarter versus what we saw in the third quarter robert majek thank you ill hop back in the queue operator operator instructions our next questioner today is edward marshall from sidoti  company please go ahead edward marshall so you hit on all cylinders looks like all the business segments performed pretty well let me ask you a question the texel business did you say that adjusted  operating margin for that business in the quarter dale g barnhart yes edward marshall for just texel dale g barnhart correct edward marshall right so if i do the math first of all its like  of earnings or so i think from that business and if i think about the  million in ebit produced from that business and i go back to the outlook from the quarter it was about  million worth of ebitda business so youve actually gotten some cost synergies it looks like unless the other three quarters are extremely seasonally weak relative to q from that business already can you kind of talk about maybe what you were able to flush out of that to get such great performance in the quarter scott m deakin id actually tell you from my other remarks looking at other question i had its too early for us to be driving those kind of operational improvements from a synergy standpoint so it was really around strength in the business we had higher sales than what we expected at least in the third quarter and timing across quarters is always tough on a new acquisition but it was strong performance and the dropthrough on those sales was very strong so it really i think was driven by just that strength of the geosynthetics market in that third quarter as the business was meeting the objectives of a number of contracts that they got over that period so it really tied to base business performance edward marshall so i mean if i go back and i look at the  million in ebitda that the business did before you acquired it and the  million in ebit that you received this quarter i mean should i assume that the other three quarters of the year are that materially slower or… i just kind of want to put that in perspective in kind of how do i think about that scott m deakin again i talked about what our initial expectations at this point are in terms of the revenue dampening into the fourth quarter its in the ballpark of  maybe  but again a big part of that business is these geosynthetic products which goes into applications that are infrastructure related and are really driven and can only be done sort of in normal weather so theres kind of really a big seasonal adjustment in the fourth and first quarter relative to second and third edward marshall okay if i switch gears a little bit and i look at performance materials im curious if you can give me or give us rather the information regarding the termination buys maybe revenue and the profit boost that you received from that and i guess secondarily is that termination buy i think its the second consecutive quarter of that and i think it was expected to be done is it now done scott m deakin yes you can assume its done and i think well have a little bit of overhang in the fourth quarter but its largely done yeartodate weve had about  million in total buy related to those termination factors i think weve told you before the dropthrough on that was very solid those particular products are very high margin so dropthrough is in the ballpark of  edward marshall  right scott m deakin yes well have a little bit in the fourth quarter but we should all be thinking about it as largely complete edward marshall okay and with the metals and i think we talked about some new products coming through and im curious was that double wall stuff kicking in or is that just china recovery dale g barnhart predominantly double wall i mean we are seeing china its actually growing and as we said in the last two quarters its been positive from an operating income standpoint but the real magnitude of growth and margin enhancement is dualwall products that we are running on the new line in hamptonville both for honda and for chrysler on their pacifica minivan edward marshall got it and so absent seasonality regarding maybe fourth quarter shutdowns et cetera i mean this is the kind of run rate from an operating perspective that you would anticipate receiving as we switch that double wall scott m deakin from a margin standpoint dale g barnhart yes edward marshall okay by the way what percent of your sales was related to double wall in the quarter dale g barnhart im not sure in the quarter yeartodate its slightly over  now in the total thermalacoustical metals segment edward marshall and predominately that was in q dale g barnhart no i would say q was probably maybe a little higher than that as we ramped up the chrysler pacifica business but its not  versus  edward marshall okay what was the – i mean there was a meaningful step change in the margin profile of the business in q… dale g barnhart two things we benefited from a very high margin prototype build which we supplied in the third quarter and secondly as we mentioned in the second quarter the drag on the business was the startup of – it wasnt just the volume or product coming in on the pacifica and honda but we are also learning to operate the new line that weve put in place so our oee was low on that line and weve been using our lean principles and through kaizen events to look at how we may improve that oee and we saw significant improvement in the oee in that line in the third quarter this year its not at optimum performance yet as we mentioned in the call we continue to expect further enhancement in the operation of that line going into  edward marshall got it thats good to hear what was the benefit of the margin prototype scott m deakin indiscernible piece of business with margins on those kinds of prototypes it was a good  points higher than what we would normally get so think about it as  relative impact to the bottom line versus what traditional prototype activity that we have from time to time is edward marshall got it and then fibers the new product im assuming youre referring to it as the floor liners and its offsetting if not fully offsetting maybe slowing production im wondering if you can kind of talk about the anticipated growth rates that you have from that the expectation maybe as what it is as a percent of your business today what you anticipate it will be over the next say  months dale g barnhart the ford product line as it ramps up through  on an annual basis anywhere from  million to  million a year on the super duty platform that weve won we are looking at opportunities in other vehicles now the new product has created that interest but again nothing has been awarded so we have that one primary platform on that product line edward marshall and did you receive that run rate in q from that business dale g barnhart no they are still ramping up and in fact they had some challenges in q they were retooling the super duty to the aluminum body as they did with the f last year and they had some normal hiccups in ramping that up so no its not at full run rate yet edward marshall so how do i think about q because you talked about revenue being up yearoveryear and sequentially and im trying to kind of parse that together with being first of all driven by new products which i think you talked about and then i guess a portion of that the floor liners but then when i think about kind of the legacy products say to the f and maybe other ford products being highermargin youve done it for a while and youre still having some hiccups around the margin how i think about the margin profile for fibers in q dale g barnhart were really not having any margin hiccups in fibers we talked about the challenges in rampup thats all in the metals business fibers business is running very well some of the margin erosion that we saw in the third quarter was contributed to mix which we had higher tooling mix which as you know is basically a passthrough for us so very little the flooring project is the major growth product thats coming in versus our core business in the third quarter we have others going in with a new line next year for another ford vehicle that will be ramping up so for the balance of this year principally driven by the flooring project in fibers in metals again its the pacifica and the honda applications that we have they are still ramping up along with the various business we won at gm and all the other oems as it relates to the metals business edward marshall so when you said challenges regarding the floor liners im assuming – i guess what i think i heard was did you say that ford was having some challenges with the… dale g barnhart that was ford edward marshall okay i just wanted to be clear on that dale g barnhart yes ford is retooling that super duty vehicle platform to the aluminum body as they did with the f last year edward marshall got it i think i misunderstood you initially thats where the hiccup came in okay scott m deakin to give you a little color to you to the question about the sequentials versus prior year i mean were not talking huge growth but there is going to be improvement relative to both of those edward marshall okay and did you originally give guidance around texel and what you expect aside from you expect to be accretive in the first year scott m deakin no we just talked about the relative size of the business in the initial release when we talked about it some of the size of the business but we didnt talk about our expectations for the year edward marshall having the business under your belt for a quarter seeing the performance in q and knowing that theres some seasonality in kind of looking at the historic measures i think it could be helpful do you have a forecast for the first  months of that acquisition and what it would contribute to a bottom line performance of lydall scott m deakin i understand your question were not disclosing that at this point but well give it some further thoughts dale g barnhart yes we do have we do have a forecast and we have a plan on what were going to achieve but again as you know we dont give that type of information i can say this its still early on and a lot has to be done but we have seen nothing that says we are not extremely happy with that acquisition both from the business that its in how it conducts it and as we stated when we made the acquisition the quality of the management team that came with that business has been a significant plus for us and so weve got an excellent management team thats operating in very healthy market edward marshall got it all right guys thanks very much operator operator instructions there look to be no further questions so this will conclude our questionandanswer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to dale barnhart president and ceo for any closing remarks dale g barnhart again i want to thank everybody for joining the call today we had an exceptional third quarter and yeartodate performance and theres no reason why we wont deliver an excellent  and were on the right trajectory to achieve our  vision for profitable growth thank you very much
