quality ingredients since my childhood i have always been on the alert to find bakery products that meet those same high standards it has not been easy most are tasteless cheaply made junk  having now had three of your awesome almond danish rings my quest has been fulfilled they have that mouthtasting feel that tells the consumer that he is enjoying something special i dont normally write to companies about their products however as i mentioned ive spent many decades looking for that special something thanks to you ive realized that indeed you can go home again thank you ” — richard pfaehler awesome almond danish “ dear amazing bakers thank you for the most astonishingly scrumptious cinnamon rolls on earth im not kidding ive seen them before and thought oh packaged rolls yeah

truly honestly genuinely authentically the best cinnamon rolls ive ever eaten and trust me on this ive sampled more than my share so many layers of perfection thank you thank you thank you and please dont ever stop making or distributing this incredible treat ” — mary fox cinnamon cravers rolls “ i love your product after a long search to find a good cheese danish i found your product it is
