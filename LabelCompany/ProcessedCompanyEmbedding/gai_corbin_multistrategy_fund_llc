to any extension amendment andor increase of the offer to purchase   ● the fund intends to make an initial payment “initial payment” for repurchased shares as follows a for members from whom the fund accepts for repurchase only a portion of their shares the fund intends to pay  of the estimated unaudited net asset value of the shares repurchased determined as of the applicable valuation date less any early withdrawal charge relating to such shares and b for members from whom the fund accepts for repurchase all of their shares the fund intends to pay  of the estimated unaudited net asset value of the shares repurchased determined as of the applicable valuation date less any early withdrawal charge relating to such shares  payments in connection with tenders generally will be made as of the later of  the th day after the valuation date or  in the sole discretion of the fund if the fund has requested withdrawals of its investment from any investment funds in order to fund the repurchase of shares within ten business days after the fund has received at least  of the aggregate amount so requested to be withdrawn by the fund from the investment funds  the fund may establish an escrow to hold funds or otherwise earmark funds including investments reasonably determined by the board to be needed to make both the initial payment and if the initial payment is less than  of the estimated unaudited net asset value the balance of such estimated net asset value  the fund will pay the balance if any of the purchase price based on the audited financial statements of the fund for the fiscal year in which such repurchase was effective  this amount will be subject to adjustment upon completion of the annual audit of the fund’s financial statements for the fiscal year in which the repurchase is effected         ● although the amounts required to be paid by the fund will generally be paid in cash the fund may under certain limited circumstances pay all or a portion of the amounts due by an inkind distribution of securities       the repurchase of shares is subject to regulatory requirements imposed by the securities and exchange commission “sec”  the fund’s repurchase procedures are intended to comply with such requirements  however in the event that the board determines that modification of the repurchase procedures described above is required or appropriate the board will adopt revised repurchase procedures as necessary to ensure the fund’s compliance with applicable regulations or as the board in its sole discretion deems appropriate  following the commencement of an offer to repurchase shares the fund may suspend postpone or terminate such offer in certain circumstances upon the determination of a majority of the board including a majority of the managers that are “not interested” as that term is defined under the  act “independent managers” that such suspension postponement or termination is advisable for the fund and its members including without limitation circumstances as a result of which it is not reasonably practicable for the fund to dispose of its investments to determine the value of its net assets or other unusual circumstances each member whose shares or portion thereof have been accepted for repurchase will continue to be a member of the fund until the valuation date and thereafter if its shares are repurchased in part and may exercise its voting rights with respect to the repurchased shares or portion thereof until the valuation date  moreover the account maintained in respect of a member whose shares or portion thereof have been accepted for repurchase will be adjusted for the net profits or net losses of the fund through the valuation date and such member’s account shall not be adjusted

liquid securities or  interests in investment funds that the fund has requested be withdrawn or any combination of them in an amount equal to the amount of accepted tendered shares  the fund may establish an escrow to hold funds or otherwise earmark funds including investments reasonably determined by the board to be needed to make both the initial payment and if the initial payment is less than  of the unaudited net asset value the balance of such net asset value  the fund may also seek to borrow amounts necessary to repurchase all or a portion of the tendered shares payments for repurchased shares may require the fund to liquidate portfolio holdings in investment funds earlier than corbin capital partners lp the “subadviser” otherwise would liquidate such holdings potentially resulting in losses including the payment of early withdrawal fees and an increase in the fund’s portfolio turnover  the fund may but need not maintain cash or borrow money to meet repurchase requests  such a practice could increase the fund’s operating expenses and impact the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective if a repurchase offer is oversubscribed by members who tender shares for repurchase and not increased the fund may choose to repurchase only a pro rata portion of the shares tendered by each member  shares tendered for repurchase will be treated as having been repurchased on a “first in  first out” basis  therefore the portion of shares repurchased will be deemed to have been taken from the earliest shares purchased by such member  except for the early withdrawal charge and direct costs and expenses such as wiring fees the fund does not presently intend to impose any charges on the repurchase of shares in the event that the investment adviser subadviser or any of their affiliates holds shares in its capacity as a member such shares may be tendered for repurchase in connection with any repurchase offer made by the fund without notice to the other members a copy of i the cover letter to offer to purchase and letter of transmittal ii the offer to purchase and iii a form of letter of transmittal are attached hereto as exhibits   and

right at any time and from time to time up to the earlier of the valuation date or when the tendered shares have been accepted by the fund to a cancel the offer and in the event of such cancellation not to purchase or pay for any shares tendered pursuant to the offer b amend the offer or c postpone the acceptance of tendered shares  if the fund determines to amend the offer or to postpone the acceptance of shares tendered it will to the extent necessary extend the period of time during which the offer is open as provided above and will promptly notify members   vi until the notice due date members have the right to change their minds and withdraw any tenders of their shares pursuant to rule e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act”  shares withdrawn may be retendered however provided that such tenders are made before  midnight eastern time on october   or if the offer is extended by any later notice due date by following the tender procedures described herein  pursuant to rule e of the exchange act if the fund has not yet accepted a member’s tender of shares on or prior to november   ie the date  business days from the commencement of the offer a

investment institute inc co bny mellon ta alternative investment ric funds at  computer drive westborough ma  attention  gai corbin multistrategy fund or fax a completed and executed letter of transmittal to bny mellon also to the attention of gai corbin multistrategy fund at    the completed and executed letter of transmittal must be received by mail or fax at the above address or fax number prior to  midnight eastern time on october    generally shares being tendered by members pursuant to a repurchase offer will need to be tendered by members at least sixtyfive  days prior to the applicable valuation date  the fund recommends that all documents be submitted to the investment adviser by certified mail return receipt requested or by facsimile transmission  bny mellon will mail to a member who has tendered their shares  an initial confirmation of receipt of tender notice within five  business days of bny mellon’s actual receipt of your tender and  a detailed tender acceptance confirmation with payment specific details and event dates regarding your tender transaction within five  business days after the acceptance of your tender by the investment adviser if you elected to tender and have not received your initial receipt of tender confirmation within five  business days please contact the investment adviser at   to obtain information about the status of your tender request any member tendering shares pursuant to the offer may withdraw its tender as described above in item avi  to be effective any notice of withdrawal must be timely received by bny mellon at the address or fax number set out on the first page of the letter of transmittal  a tender of shares properly withdrawn shall not thereafter be deemed to be tendered for purposes of the offer  shares withdrawn may be retendered however provided that such tenders are made before the notice due date by following the tender procedures described herein  to request a form of withdrawal notice a member may contact the fund the contact information for which can be found in item  above   viii for purposes of the offer the fund will be deemed to have accepted shares that are tendered when it gives written notice to the tendering member of its election to purchase such shares   ix if more than the offer amount of shares are duly tendered to the fund prior to the expiration of the offer and not withdrawn the fund will in its sole discretion either a accept the additional shares permitted to be accepted pursuant to rule efii under the exchange act b extend the offer if necessary and increase the amount of shares that the fund is offering to purchase to an amount it believes sufficient to accommodate the excess shares tendered as well as any shares tendered during the extended offer or c accept shares tendered on or before the notice due date for payment on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate net asset value of tendered shares   x the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer will have the effect of increasing the proportionate interest in the fund of members who do not tender shares  members who retain their shares may be subject to increased risks that may possibly result from the reduction in the fund’s aggregate assets resulting from payment for the shares tendered  these risks include the potential for greater volatility due to decreased diversification however the fund believes that this result is unlikely given the nature of the fund’s investment program additionally a reduction in the aggregate assets of the fund may result in higher costs for remaining members to the extent that certain expenses borne by the fund are relatively fixed and may not decrease if assets decline  these effects may be reduced or eliminated to the extent that additional purchases of shares are made by new andor existing members from time to time   xi not applicable xii the repurchase or transfer of shares may result in a taxable gain or loss to the tendering member  different tax consequences may apply for tendering and nontendering members in connection with a repurchase offer  for example if a member does not tender all of his or her shares such repurchase may not be treated as an exchange for us federal income tax purposes and may result in deemed distributions to nontendering members  on the other hand members who tender all of their shares including shares deemed owned by members under constructive ownership rules will be treated as having sold their shares and generally will realize a capital gain or loss  such gain or loss is measured by the difference between the member’s amount received and his or her adjusted tax basis of the shares  for noncorporate members gain or loss from the transfer or repurchase of shares generally will be taxable at a us federal income tax rate dependent upon the length of time the shares were held  shares held for a period of one year or less at the time of such repurchase or transfer will for us federal income tax purposes generally result in shortterm capital gains or losses and those held for more than one year will generally result in longterm capital gains or losses additionally any loss realized on a disposition of shares of the fund may be disallowed under “wash sale” rules to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced with other shares of the fund within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after the shares are disposed of such as pursuant to a dividend reinvestment in shares of the fund  if disallowed the loss will be reflected in an upward adjustment to the basis of the shares acquired pursuant to treasury regulations directed at tax shelter activity taxpayers are required to disclose to the internal revenue service certain information on form  if they participate in a “reportable transaction”  a transaction may be a “reportable transaction” based upon any of several indicia with respect to a member including the recognition of a loss in excess of certain thresholds for individuals  million in one year or  million in any combination of years  members should consult their own tax advisers concerning any
