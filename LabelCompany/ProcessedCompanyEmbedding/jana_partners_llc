the board so agrium can reach its full potential while agrium has moved to address certain issues first raised privately by jana – including boosting its capital return to shareholders and beginning to improve disclosure relating to its retail business retail – janas new presentation zeroes in on the remaining issues previously identified by jana which the board has yet to fully address and which
