war  is the definitive grand strategy game of the period it is a turn based regional game with an emphasis on playability and historical accuracy it is built on the renowned age game engine with a modern and intuitive interface that makes it easy to learn yet hard to master this  historical operational strategy game with a simultaneous turnbased engine wego system that places players at the head of the usa or csa during the american civil war  you take the part of the military and political leadership trying to lead your nation to victory in the midst of some of the toughest operations of the civil war you will build organize and command your armies over one of the largest maps of the usa ever made for a civil war game there are a host of real military leaders to appoint with their own strengths and weaknesses and choosing the right man for the job is crucial however you are not just a military leader and must make vital economics and political decisions these can have far reaching effects and you can even influence foreign intervention from the french  british who were constantly intervening in america for power and prestige each turn lasts  weeks and you must issue your orders in advance planning on where the enemy will be not where they are now – which is called a wego system we go at the same time orders are executed simultaneously in  phases –  per day battles are resolved on the day they occur so scheduling the arrival of your forces and planning the logistics or your army are key to success you can send a massive force to assault an enemy position but if you do not carefully plan the attack you can have you troops arriving piecemeal and being easily dispatched the wego system adds excitement and suspense and is far more realistic than traditional turn based games this is must have game for anyone interested in the period or grand strategy games in general                view all screenshotsfeatures setting the game covers all of
