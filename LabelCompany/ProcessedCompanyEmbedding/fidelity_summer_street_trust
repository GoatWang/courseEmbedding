repurchase agreement rate the “ficash rate”  and b a benchmark rate representing the lowest bank loan rate available for borrowing by the funds “benchmark rate” the board of trustees each a “fund board” and collectively the “fund boards” of each fund including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” as defined in section a of the act “independent trustees” establishes the benchmark rate and reviews no less frequently than annually the continuing appropriateness of the benchmark rate the benchmark rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the federal funds rate over the previous  days  applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary therefore applicants seek to amend the prior order to eliminate the use of the otd rate in the ifl rate calculation provided in conditions  and  “rate conditions” applicants also request an exemption from section a of the act applicants legal analysis  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company

another person in part to be any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person section a of the act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company” because the funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser that is under common control with those of the other funds applicants state that each fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other funds and therefore an affiliated person of those funds  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from selling securities or other property to the investment company section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company section d of the act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section  section f of the act prohibits registered openend investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank if immediately after the borrowing there is asset coverage of at least  per centum for all borrowings of the company under section g of the act the term “senior security” generally includes any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness

and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the act section c of the act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section d if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors  section d of the act and rule d under the act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of an affiliated person when acting as principal from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the commission rule db provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule the commission will consider whether the participation of a registered

act granting an exemption from section d of the act c sections c and b of the act granting an exemption from sections a a and a of the act and d section d of the act and rule d under the act to permit certain joint arrangements the requested order would amend the rate conditions in the prior order and grant applicants an exemption from section a of the act  as noted previously applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary applicants state further that the ifl rate as amended would make it more likely that lending funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the ifl program if the ifl rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate applicants state that the rate conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity  applicants also state that the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions will not involve any potential that one fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another fund applicants state that under the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions rates will be set under a preestablished formula approved by the fund boards applicants state that all funds participating in the ifl program as revised by the rate conditions on any given day will receive the same interest rate  applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the rate conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the act and meet the standards set forth in sections c dj b and d of the act and rule d under the act applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the rate conditions would be reasonable and fair would not involve overreaching and would be consistent with the investment policies of the funds and with the general purposes of the act applicants submit further that each funds participation in the ifl program would be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act
