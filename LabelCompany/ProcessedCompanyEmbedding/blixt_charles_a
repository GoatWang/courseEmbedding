the people  the power game interview with charles blixt rj reynolds tobacco pageok interview with charles blixt rj reynolds tobacco company   hedrick smith productions inc the tobacco lobby money grassroots and telemarketing smith what about the presidents initiative on teenage smokers and trying to focus on that what would be  whats your objection to that and would the impact of that be in your opinion blixt we have no objection to  to anybody initiative which is going to reduce the incidents of youth smoking in this country we have repeatedly said and we believe kids shouldnt smoke we dont want kids smoking but this isnt about kids smoking the fdas proposal is not about youth smoking its about should the government intrude into the daily lives of american  adult american smokers and should ultimately tobacco products be prohibited thats the agenda of the antismoking industry and i believe thats the agenda of the fda at this point smith so this is a revisiting of prohibition in effect the prohibition amendment to the constitution blixt there are two ways you can prohibit products one is straight up face the issue you dont like something as they did in the   in the early th century with alcohol you absolutely prohibit something the american people have been through that they know thats not appropriate they dont want it for any product certainly not for tobacco products the other way you can do it and the way that the antismoking industry is trying to do it now is through the back door try to make it so difficult for people to buy cigarettes so difficult for people to get advertising about cigarette products and so difficult for them to smoke anywhere including in their own home in some instances to prohibit smoking through the back door rather than facing the issue straight up smith did you at rjr and other companies in the industry encourage your employees and your customers and others to write in obviously this was a wide open invitation from the fda for anybody to write in blixt we encourage anybody to comment on these proposed regulations the entire tobacco family who is affected by it as well as our consumers and customers and many many nonsmokers who  who believe that these broad sweeping grabs for power by the federal bureaucracy are inappropriate hedrick smith shows several tobacco industry products to charles blixt that contain appeals to customers to contact the fda and congress including a camel carton a winston select carton and some direct mail solicitations smith in connection to appealing to people let me just ask you about what i came across this is a camel carton from your company and then inside theres a solicitation essentially whats the pitch here blixt this is a way that we can use to communicate with our customers to tell them in response to their inquiries heres how you can deal with this issue and heres how you can talk directly to the federal government when theyre trying to attack your right to smoke smith is this now pretty much standard in every carton blixt oh no this is  these things are put into cartons when theres an issue thats in front of  uh  facing the customers who buy our products because frequently well get calls from them well get inquiries from them what do i do how do i address these issues smith what youre talking about here in terms of your company and the tobacco industry is an enormous effort what does it cost to fight something like this in terms of legal costs  what did you say  pages of documents  a lot of typing of xeroxing  are we into tens of millions of dollars to deal with something for your company and repeat it for brown and williamson phillip morris repeat it for otherswhat does it cost blixt well certainly rick whenever theres a proposal by the federal government to totally disrupt our business to attack our industry to attack the consumers right to have access to these products which are totally legal in this country and try to limit the ability of people to have freedom to choose to smoke if they want to we as a tobacco company are willing to spend whatever it costs to insure that that illegal action doesnt  doesnt get taken and i think your characterization of tens of millions is probably accurate congress  lobbyists the inside influence game smith what about in terms of communicating with congress isnt it very similar to a political campaign in some ways blixt well its an expensive operation but its the right thing to do for our customers who want to have the ability to choose to smoke and to have access to products and its the cost of us  to us of doing business and a cost that we have to do to enable our customers to have the right to smoke and the right to purchase this legal product if they choose to do it smith youre communicating with members of congress youre communicating with large numbers of the public youre communicating directly with the fda youre organizing people youve got to pay attention to the legislative situation on the hillyou have to do all this to defend your business blixt but we have to do all of these things to defend our right to do business and our customers right to have access to a legal product that they choose to use and certainly all of those things that youve outlined are a part of it smith the politics the public relations the communications all that blixt all of thats involved in  in our maintaining our right to stay in business smith im wondering about the contacts with the congress nowwe were talking a few moments ago about waxman and the hearing which obviously  it wasnt something you all welcomed blixt thats a safe assumption rick smith i presume the climate is a good deal more friendly at the moment you have tom bliley as chairman of the house commerce committee he said there will be no more regulation of the tobacco industry while im chairman from your perspective are you more relaxed about congress now have you got a better climate than you had say two years ago blixt well i think the whole country has a better climate in congress if the whole country believes as i believe the american people believe that we dont need additional federal bureaucracy intruding into the daily lives of americans whether specific congressmen or specific committees of the congress are a more friendly environment for us id leave up to the political commentators but certainly we havent had any hearings since  since mr bliley became chairman of that subcommittee smith in that sense its obviously better blixt well certainly those hearings specifically as they were conducted were not the kind of hearings that anybody would enjoy going through because they were conducted in what i consider to be a very unprofessional manner smith there has been a marked shift in political contributions to the republican party by a lot of people but strikingly by yourselves and others in the tobacco industry whats the reason for that blixt well i think the primary reason for that is we as a company just as any other company that is involved with any business makes contributions to political people who believe in the same things we believe in and it is apparent to us that the kind of people that believe what we believe that the federal government doesnt need to be creating massive new bureacracies intruding into peoples daily lives are on that side of the isle right now and those are the people who we made contributions to because they believe the same things we believe smith so bucks and beliefs have flown together instead of balancing off as in the past blixt well i wouldnt necessarily say that rick because i know we do make some contributions to democrats as well as republicans but to those who believe what we believe and certainly we are not going to make contributions to people who are going to attack our industry and attack the issues we stand for home  overview  prescongress  medialobby  freshman  voters forum
