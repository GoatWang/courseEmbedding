did the ceo have for breakfast by constance l hays published september   lots of money managers have big corner offices high above midtown but laura j sloate may be the only one whose carpet is covered with dog hair the shedding is the work of quartz her monthold german shepherd who is a finicky eater and her guide dog as of july but the rest of the trappings  the computers the piles of research material the elegant eisenstadt photographs decorating one wall  are the doing of ms sloate though she has been blind since the age of  she has built up a successful firm that bears her name and manages  million in assets for wealthy individuals and institutional investors my personal philosophy is extreme conservatism and she fits the bill said don gruhn who has held a seat on the new york stock exchange for  years and hired ms sloate  years ago to manage several million dollars in accounts for him and his family there are a lot of gunslingers who do well in an up market and get destroyed in a down market he says and laura has never had bad bad losses nothing frankly seems to get in her way her day begins at dawn with a run on  flights of stairs up and down in her upper east side apartment building she has skimmed the headlines of eight newspapers by the time breakfast is over shes fed the dog and bustled both of them into her chauffeured car to get to work by  then its  hours in the office interrupted only to take quartz for a walk around the block often followed by dinner with one of her clients she serves on half a dozen boards both professional and philanthropic in her spare time she follows the national football league on television shes devoted to the new york jets and the san francisco ers rides a tandem bicycle steered by members of the columbia university mens track team goes to the opera and museums and pursues interests like studying the bible i have things to do  hours a day and theres only  she says not terribly lightly and i have to waste a certain amount of time sleeping her blindness caused by detached retinas is not something that she tends to dwell on she has little patience for organizations that portray the blind as one more disadvantaged minority i really think that blind people are made a special category by society and they want to be because they can use it as an escape she says but with a guide dog and some electronic equipment today its an equal playing field now  she chose a business renowned for its brutality and she has been as tough as anyone else at one point her nickname was cobra last year she had a fallingout with her brother martin who had been a partner she said they split over her decision to drop the firms retail brokerage business which she considered too small to justify the liability involved they havent spoken much since then im a perfectionist ms sloate says and i guess im pretty driven im pretty tough on myself too but what is that saying the person who loses well isnt really a winner clients quickly learn not to suggest investments to her she runs the show we feel she is extremely knowledgeable about the companies she looks at to invest in said brian k lavery a senior financial analyst with geocenters a newton massbased defense contractor who calls ms sloate the most profitable of five money managers running the companys profitsharing retirement plan she can tell you what the ceo had for breakfast has she ever lost out because people didnt trust a blind person to manage their money i think so she says nobodys ever going to admit it but im sure other people lose business because someone didnt like their personality or didnt like their shirt to accommodate her lack of eyesight her office is equipped with a talking computer that chants the ticker tape in a fairly human sounding voice and a digitalizer which converts printed matter to computerspeak students taperecord more reading material which she listens to day and night and others who go over the newspapers with her every evening she studies all this information to detect events and trends that might push prices up or down we can only guesstimate educationally and hope were right ms sloate said sitting back in an upholstered leather chair she has a certain rawboned charm and within minutes her supremely confident investing strategy has captured center stage she likes drugstore chains at the moment these chains have become the delivery agent of the prescription benefit program ms sloate says then she rattles off reasons she expects their value to spiral upward aging baby boomers will need more prescription drugs especially as hospitals send people home earlier than they used to and will buy them from the corner drugstore for the convenience she has picked some winners in her time   in a row at one point which earned admiration from her peers  and some losers too there was avis which she liked but which sank to  a share from  she says in the s after she recommended it to investors in many ways new york is uniquely accommodating to her life style in snowstorms she is able to board the fifth avenue bus for the trip downtown i wouldnt be able to do that in los angeles she says she dines at restaurants like coco pazzo and girasole quartz watching the world go by from beneath her table i ice skate too she says i could probably rollerblade but ive never tried it i used to play basketball i memorized where the basket was and i sank  to  percent of my shots she started out as a clerk in  working for a mutual fund that folded a few months later it was meant to be a onetime thing a break from doctoral studies in american history at columbia but ms sloate was hooked she moved along to series of jobs and then in  with a friend neil weisman who had grown disenchanted with being a cog in a big firm she began sloate weisman murray  company mr weisman left the company on good terms in  the point of her work ms sloate says is to make money for her clients although she makes plenty of it herself she would not divulge her salary she has set up a foundation hermione that makes grants to causes like education and aids we did six figures this year she says at a very early stage you think your intelligence and success mean something she said over time you find it doesnt mean that much there are lots of other things in life photo laura sloate has been hooked on investing since  her guide dog quartz is new to hour days at the office catrina genovese for the new york times   inside nytimescom health raquo too hot to handle arts » the harmony of
