sue will discuss our second quarter performance in more detail and address some topics we know are on the minds of investors and ill then close with a brief summary before we take your questions our overall strategy remains straightforward and we believe our people and culture are a source of competitive advantage first our business model is rooted in anticipating and addressing global trends that impact the way we live work and move we focus on delivering outstanding products and services in durable growing markets in our case its an orientation toward the importance of sustainability enabled by technologies growing at exponential rates that will create new business models and sources of productivity in a world that will increasingly value the conservation of resources we excel at delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions reducing food waste preserving natural resources and generating productivity for our customers its what we do and its what were known for we maintain a healthy level investment in our businesses to sustain leading brands which are number one or number two in virtually every market in which we participate second we excel at delivering strong topline incremental margins and free cash flow through our business operating system our business operating system is continuously improving and underpins everything we do and enables us to constantly generate high levels of free cash flow which powers our dynamic capital allocation strategy our strategy once again served us well in the second quarter we followed our business operating system to achieve outstanding organic revenue growth of  and adjusted continuing eps of  an increase of  we also expanded adjusted operating margin  basis points and generated  million in free cash flow our very strong revenue growth gives us great optionality to balance ongoing business investments for the longterm with meeting or beating our more nearterm  financial commitments the larger categories of business investment include channel infrastructure and new product development that position us in a way to continually improve our competitive position in the second quarter the company delivered strong topline and bottomline results we realize continued strength in the climate segment which reported an organic revenue up highsingle digits residential and north american commercial hvac led the companys growth and as expected were also seeing steady and consistent improvement in our industrial segment which saw positive revenue growth and delivered strong margin expansion and order growth this was the second consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth for industrial and it was also quarter marked by the launch of several product offerings compression technologies and services for example launched another model in the nextgeneration rseries compressor family this quarter and its variable speed offering is up to  more efficient than the industry average we just recently received external recognition with the environmental leader product award for advances made in energy efficiency with the nextgeneration rseries line of compressors this is one great example out of the  new products we launched in the quarter that demonstrate the kind of innovative advanced offerings we offer our customers to build on our leadership position for the long run we enable our customers to be both environmentally responsible and productive at the same time so customers are no longer obligated to choose one or the other moving to slide four we changed our format a bit from our traditional market view to a midyear update that provides insights in how were seeing the markets and our businesses now versus where we saw them when we provided our initial guidance in january based on the questions we received leading up to this call we believe youll find the approach to be valuable ill touch on the primary areas that weve highlighted as areas to watch so im going to keep it focused its not intended to be an update on every cut of the business here where were seeing any element of change so if we dont hit something here well cover it in the qa session the first topic is volume and revenues which have been stronger than expected the north american and china commercial hvac and our north american residential hvac markets exceeded our initial expectations our north american commercial hvac building services business for example achieved record performance in q with its highest revenue recorded and  revenue growth combined with the market share gains weve enjoyed based on our product and service leadership and sales excellence all critical components of our business operating system were seeing very strong revenue growth while we see the potential for growth to moderate in the second half of the year we forecast that we will continue to exceed our initial plan for the year on an equallypositive note with industrial were tracking to exceed our annual revenue plan there too the next topic is the pricetomaterial inflation spread well before  kicked off we highlighted that we expected  to be in an inflationary environment that historically weve been able to achieve a positive pricematerial inflation spread of about  basis points to  basis points as we moved through the first quarter the environment became increasingly inflationary but still looked manageable to a basis point positive spread if cost and pricing held steady as we moved through the second quarter material cost inflation has continued to persist and its moved beyond steel and tier  materials to all metals and into refrigerants because our volumes have exceeded our expectations which were pleased about were purchasing a higher percentage of commodities at current prices versus locked prices resulting in more inflationary headwinds we did achieve a positive pricetomaterial inflation spread in our industrial segment and within our residential business as well as in transport in the second quarter our pricetomaterial inflationary headwind was in our commercial hvac business and mainly this was centered in the asia middle east and latin american regions looking forward its important to note that we continue to expect to get positive price as we did in the second quarter in fact we expect to realize higher pricing as compared to last year and we believe this will continue through the balance of the year however we are planning around the assumption that price realization will be below our prior forecast in the second half we believe its prudent to plan for a negative pricetomaterial cost spread similar to what we saw in the first half of the year and this was built into our updated guidance for approximately  a share the fourth topic is relative to our transport business at the beginning of the year we indicated we believed the durability and diversity of the business would enable us to maintain modestly down revenues and margins based on expected declines in the north american trailer market and this has not changed but the way we believe well get to the same result is a bit different were seeing modestly better results in north american trailers and softer results in our european trailer business as well as strong auxiliary power unit bookings as well as truck unit bookings and revenue so in all this is netting out to a relatively unchanged outlook for the transport business the next topic is foreign exchange generally speaking the dollar has been weaker than we originally forecasted which has largely closed the gap between our reported results and our organic results which is a benefit to us its meaningful to remember that operating margin currency translation historically flows through the pl at a rate approximately half of what we pull through from operations so overall this is creating a modest impact to our leverage rates primarily on eurobased revenues netting out all of these updates strong revenue and share gain combined with positive price and productivity has enabled us to not only cover the cost of material inflation and other inflation its also enabled us to maintain high levels of investment in our business which helps us maintain our momentum over the long term we expect that we will grow our business and expand margins again in the back half of the year which gives us more confidence to raise our fullyear guidance to the high end of our previous range with the same expectation of generating cash equal to or greater than net income and returning significant cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and pursuing accretive ma where we can create value the future is very bright and were excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in  and beyond i hope that this has given you some important insights into how our outlook has evolved through the midpoint of the year and now id like to turn the call over to sue to discuss the first quarter in more detail susan k carter  ingersollrand plc thank you mike please go to slide number five i will begin with a summary of main points id like you to take away from todays call as mike discussed we have exited the first half of  on a strong note with continued strong financial and operational results first half bookings growth organic revenue growth adjusted operating margin improvement adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow are all on track or ahead of expectations at this stage in the year and give us confidence in raising our revenue growth adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow guidance our bookings and revenue performance were strong with growth in both segments climate organic bookings and revenue were up  and  respectively residential hvac led the way with highteens growth in bookings and revenues and improved operating margin commercial revenues were also healthy up midsingle digits our industrial segment continues on a path of steady improvement with strong bookings growth revenue growth and a basis point improvement in adjusted operating margins excluding capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development of  million or  percentage points that were reclassified to the income statement in the second quarter of  margins expanded by  basis points these solid results give us further confidence in our fullyear guidance for the segment in january we laid out our capital allocation priorities for  including spending approximately  million on dividends and an additional  billion on a combination of share buybacks and acquisitions yeartodate through today weve spent  million on share buybacks and  million in dividends weve also spent approximately  million on acquisitions we are continuing to follow the dynamic capital allocation plan we announced in january please go to slide number six focused execution of our business strategy underpinned by operational excellence drove strong yearoveryear financial performance net revenues increased  organically adjusted operating margins improved  basis points and adjusted earnings per share was higher by  robust revenue growth positive price and productivity enabled us to more than offset increased materials inflation pressures from metals and refrigerants while maintaining a healthy business investment please go to slide number seven organic orders were strong in the second quarter up  with increased activity in both our hvac and industrial businesses we drove particularly strong growth in residential up highteens driven by a robust market and continued market share gains organic commercial hvac bookings were down lowsingle digits impacted by a tough comparison to prior year when we booked a very large order in the north america commercial hvac contracting business excluding this order north america bookings would have been up  in the second quarter outside of north america commercial hvac organic bookings were broadbased with highsingle digit growth in emea and asia transport organic bookings were up lowsingle digits with gains in north america emea and asia our diversification strategy enabled us to offset the decline in trailers through growth in worldwide truck aftermarket and apus in the quarter industrial organic bookings were up  in the quarter led by strength in compression technologies and fluid management regionally north america and europe were flat while we had strong growth in china india and the middle east and africa please go to slide number eight in our climate segment organic revenue up lowteens in both north america and china applied was up highsingle digits and unitary and aftermarket were both up midsingle digits in our industrial segment overall organic revenue was up  led by highsingle digit growth in north america and lowsingle digit growth in asia in our compression technology business north america was up low to midteens in both equipment and parts and services and asia also delivered strong equipment growth up highsingle digits overall north america revenues were up lowteens and international revenues were flat netting  organic growth rate for the enterprise please go to slide number nine q adjusted operating margin improved  basis points primarily driven by strong volume productivity and price partially offset by material and other inflation we continue to invest in the business for q approximately  of our investments were in new product development  in channel optimization programs and  in opex on process and productivityrelated projects to further improve our longterm competitive positioning please go to slide number  overall climate performance was strong in the quarter with organic revenues up  and an adjusted operating margin of  strong revenue growth in both commercial and residential hvac was partially offset by modestly lower transport revenues climate adjusted operating margin was down slightly yearoveryear significantly higher revenues productivity and price were offset by headwinds from material inflation and a lower product mix of highermargin transport revenues please go to slide number  our industrial segment continues to show steady improvement in second quarter in addition to organic bookings growth of  the business drove organic revenue growth of  and adjusted operating margin improvement of  basis points our continued focus on improving the fundamental operations of the business through commercial focus on aftermarket operational excellence initiatives and cost reduction measures is delivering tangible results please go to slide number  free cash flow was  million for the second quarter driven largely by strong profits working capital as a percent of revenue for the quarter improved  basis points versus the second quarter of  yeartodate free cash flow is  million our guidance for free cash flow has been raised to approximately  billion which is the high end of our previous range reflecting continued expectations for free cash flow to be equal to or greater than net income additionally our balance sheet continues to strengthen which provides optionality as our markets continue to evolve please go to slide number  continued strong cash flows in  enables us to drive a dynamic capital allocation strategy employing capital where it earns the best returns in january we laid out our  capital allocation priorities and they remain unchanged our first priority is continuing to make high roi investments in our business these include investment in innovation and in strategic growth programs these ongoing investments are at the heart of our innovation growth and margin expansion story and our performance demonstrates our strategy is delivering results the secondary is maintaining a strong balance sheet were bbb rated today and believe this is the appropriate structure for the company at the present time the third area is our commitment to paying a highly competitive reliable dividend that grows at or above the rate of earnings growth over time weve paid an annual dividend for  years and have consistently raised this dividend over the years in fact the compound annual growth rate of our dividend is  over the past five years the fourth priority is strategic acquisitions and share repurchases in january of this year we committed to spend  billion between these two areas and yeartodate weve spent approximately  million on share repurchases and approximately  million on acquisitions we intend to spend the balance of the  billion during the remainder of  our pipeline of actionable and available acquisitions is approximately  million to  million at any given point in time we will continue to create longterm value for our shareholders through a dynamic capital allocation strategy as we have consistently done for years please go to slide  our strong first half financial performance gives us confidence in raising our  adjusted continuing earnings per share guidance to the high end of our previously communicated range of approximately  per share we have also raised our organic revenue guidance for the year from approximately  to approximately  reflecting very strong revenues in the first half and expectations for continued healthy market growth and share gains in the second half by segment we expect climate organic revenues to be up approximately  and industrial organic revenues to be flat both reflecting improvements versus our prior guidance please go to slide number  this slide lays out our updated guidance versus our prior guidance in more detail id note that our free cash flow guidance has been raised to approximately  billion which is the high end of the previous rage reflecting continued expectations for free cash flow to be equal to or greater than net income please go to slide  weve received positive feedback on the section covering key topics we know are of interest to you in our prepared remarks so well cover a few such topics on the next couple of slides similar to what weve done in recent quarters the first topic is the expected impact of currency on our  guidance for the full year we have been expecting roughly a  impact from a strengthening dollar primarily against the euro at this point in the year were not expecting the dollar to strengthen as much as previously forecast which has improved our currency impact from negative  to about a negative  we also expect currency to have a minor impact on revenues which is reflected in our revised guidance the next topic is our second quarter climate segment leverage which was lower than you might expect on the strong revenues we delivered the primary factors impacting leverage in the second quarter in the climate segment were persistent material cost and other inflation unfavorable product mix from a lower mix of transport revenues which carry relatively higher margins compared to the other climate business and lower overseas margins than expected primarily tied to lower revenues it is important to note that we continue to expect to see margin expansion in commercial in the second half of  and this is embedded in our guidance please go to slide  the last topic for today is the noncash noneconomic negative discrete tax item of  million or negative  earnings per share we laid out in our earnings release this morning this charge is related to the impairment of deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss carryforwards in latin america it is important to note that while these assets are impaired the net operating loss carryforwards remain available for future use if profitability exceeds our current projections so theres no current or future cash or economic impact to the company ill now turn it back to mike for closing remarks michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc thank you sue so in closing on slide  we are executing our  plan and building a thriving more valuable ingersollrand im proud of our employees who successfully executed our strategy and delivered another strong financial and operational quarter for the company we expect to see continued toptier revenue and operating margin improvement in the back half of the year our robust revenue and booking performance gives us the optionality to make continued investments in the business to further improve our competitive positioning for the long run while at the same time raising our financial targets for  to summarize our climate segment remains strong led by our commercial and residential hvac businesses which are focused on growth areas with equipment controls and service our transport refrigeration business is diverse and agile and will execute their strategy as they typically do our industrial business is on track and is delivering steady consistent improvement we have a tremendous depth of talented people and our culture remains as strong as ever and taken together im confident that with this formula well continue to deliver toptier financial and operating performance and with that sue and i will now be happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator your first question is from nigel coe from morgan stanley your line is open nigel coe  morgan stanley  co llc thanks good morning michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc good morning nigel nigel coe  morgan stanley  co llc hi mike so the tone on pricecost definitely changed since the midmay timeframe at epg so im wondering has there been deterioration in the price environment i understand you talked about its rest of world commercial but has there been deterioration in the price environment since that point and on that topic are you building a section  impact into the second half of the year into your guidance michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc yeah id start by saying nigel that as far as price goes most competitive pricing is happening where youve got overcapacity of oems in areas like china or theres some economic difficulty like the middle east or latin america so pricing there is definitely more difficult weve watched inflation persist weve watched it move into refrigerants as an example into the second quarter the volumes that we delivered were much higher than the volumes that we had forecasted so we ended up in the spot market to a much greater extent than we did the sort of the hedged view of the world so our outlook for the back half of the year now looks a lot like the first half of the year we would expect sort of a  basis point  basis point  basis point negative spread so we think were not expecting any more price its about the same amount of price as we got in the first half of the year and a fairly conservative view around where we think direct  material inflation goes were still going to raise margins in the back half of the year and were going to do that and still continually invest in the company and climate would be a great example that even where its holding through that pricematerial inflation spread is the same as the back half of the year the investments are about twice the rate they were in the first half of the year so i think the formula for continuing to invest in growth and invest in productivity is just another area of the income statement for us to go attack as we would normally do not just the pricematerial inflation piece of the pl nigel coe  morgan stanley  co llc okay susan k carter  ingersollrand plc and nigel if i could add just a few things to what mike said and then ill get to your followup question so the answer to your question on whether weve seen more inflation in commodities than what we expected for  is a definite yes and that inflation has come from steel its come from copper turning from what we thought was a slight deflation for the year to an inflationary metric aluminum has been slightly inflationary and refrigerants have also been inflationary for the year and in fact refrigerants represent about  of our inflationary pressure for the year another thing that i would tell you though is that with the volumes that weve had in  todate the increase also reflects some of the volumes that weve had where weve had to go out and buy at spot so its a good problem and its a great thing but it has caused us increased inflationary pressure and i would add just one more point on what mike talked about with the commercial hvac regions where were seeing not only pricing pressure but also inflationary pressure with asia the middle east and latin america these are some of our best businesses at managing the total pl and productivity so while these businesses are causing us some pressure on pricecost they also do a pretty good job of delivering their commitments by working the entire pl and i think thats what well continue to do as a total company for the remainder of the year nigel coe  morgan stanley  co llc okay great thats helpful and then as a followon just the north american commercial i think we understand the comp issue but maybe just dig into the verticals in terms of where youre seeing the underlying strength and weakness and specifically we are picking up some signs of a slowdown in light commercial activity maybe on the tendering side are you seeing that mike michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc first nigel we forgot to answer your  question just really quickly on that steel prices for us are fairly well set now for the balance of the year so between inventory and pricing thats out there that rolls through the balance of the year we think weve got steel fairly well set in terms of our outlook for the balance of the year nigel coe  morgan stanley  co llc okay okay michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc now going to markets our view all along is that at some point you would see a positive but declining growth rate in the overall unitary market particularly as it relates to commercial buildings and i think that that is definitely still our outlook for the back half of the year but offsetting that we still think that were more in the early innings of the applied business in the institutional markets and still have a nice pipeline moving through  in that regard nigel coe  morgan stanley  co llc okay ill leave it there thanks a lot michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc thank you operator your next question comes from andrew kaplowitz of citi your line is open andrew kaplowitz  citigroup global markets inc hey good morning guys michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc hi andy susan k carter  ingersollrand plc good morning andrew kaplowitz  citigroup global markets inc mike so industrial order growth was plus  in q plus  in q revenue growth was also positive in both quarters we know you want to be conservative but why would organic revenue growth for the year just be flattish i think we understand that some of the orders youre getting are for your large longlead compressors that wont impact  but is there something else youre seeing in the industrial business that keeps you conservative about your forward forecast michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc well for me no its really looking at those large orders and the timing of that and then just looking at customer deliveries so we had really a pleasant surprise in the first half of the year that the bookandturn business was better than we had anticipated and we saw it across the board in power tools fluid management even the consumer vehicle and club car so there could be some upside to that number if the bookandturn continues at the same rate but what really drives the big revenue for us are the bigger projects and weve got those scheduled out pretty tightly andrew kaplowitz  citigroup global markets inc okay thats helpful mike and i wanted to follow up on the commercial hvac orders that nigel talked about what was your internal expectations for the quarter and then how are you thinking about orders for the rest of the year you mentioned the improvement in applied does that accelerate as the year goes on how should we look at that michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc yeah we did great in the quarter if you look back all last year i think our bookings growth was doubledigits so were really coming off tough comps what youre really seeing here is last year at the same time we booked  millionplus single contract and we have those in the pipeline but you cant predict exactly when theyre going to fall we dont bake the business around it we dont determine our cost structure and investment schedules around whether or not that stuff comes or goes but the markets have been strong they remain strong the share data remains in our favor universally across all product categories certainly in service and across the globe so were happy with whats going on we invested in growth and we feel like were getting it andy so im as optimistic as i was coming into the year about the back half of the year in our commercial hvac business andrew kaplowitz  citigroup global markets inc okay mike thats helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of joe ritchie from goldman sachs your line is open joe ritchie  goldman sachs  co llc thanks good morning everyone michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc hi joe susan k carter  ingersollrand plc morning joe ritchie  goldman sachs  co llc hey so maybe touching on pricing for a second the  basis points of negativeprice cost you expect to occur in the second half of the year i guess one question is what constrains you at this point from pricing further in order for that to narrow into the second half knowing that commodity prices have increased susan k carter  ingersollrand plc well again i think joe the tough part of all of this is really looking at weve got announced price increases out there and what were seeing move around is the inflation but well also continue to see the pricecost pressure in those regions of the world that we talked about with asia the middle east actually its specifically china the middle east and latin america so we dont expect that to go away and we dont expect it to be able to influence again our steel is locked in for the back half of the year the majority of our copper is locked in so we dont expect to be able to change that dynamic overall and so what we can do as a company when we look at that back half of the year and the pricecost spread is really just manage the entire pl make sure that were really working on the productivity in the business and you saw some of that in the second quarter and also managing our costs in the right way michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc yeah joe remember too that every single part of the company with the exception of commercial hvac had price that exceeded material inflation if you focus solely on commercial hvac its much easier to maintain that pricecost relationship in the unitary business than say within the applied business were out pricing today six nine  months out into the future so if inflation shoots up dramatically in the case of refrigerants as an example which are used extensively in great volumes in applied equipment youre going to see that you didnt cover it so its really isolated to that commercial hvac business but again to the markets that are most competitive and into larger equipment where you sometimes have a hard time getting in front of it when it moves up dramatically for really no reason joe ritchie  goldman sachs  co llc thanks thats helpful color following up on that mike you mentioned that that price was positive really kind of across the portfolio with the exception of commercial hvac if you were to maybe give us a little bit more color on q specifically around the incremental margins within climate so specifically on commercial hvac residential and thermo king how did the incremental margins look for those different pieces of the business within the quarter michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc well it would have been the highest in residential where we again are expanding margins i think dramatically there and lowest in the commercial hvac business where in parts of the world you might have had deleverage on growth growth and volume with deleverage again this would be areas im thinking about china parts of the middle east where that would have happened and then within the tk business we would have seen even a mix swing where most of the growth in europe happened in eastern europe not in western europe so you end up with a little bit of a regional cut there which hurts things sue do you have anything you want to add to that susan k carter  ingersollrand plc yes and i think thats exactly right is that the top incremental leverage came out of the residential business followed by commercial north america and emea and then offset by some of those areas where weve talked about that pricecost was definitely an issue and then to mikes point on tk we did have a mix down in – first of all from tk which generally has higher margins than the other climate businesses but also from some of their european sales which were lowermargin type of sales and not in the truck and trailer where weve got great margins so just a temporary mix down on tk michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc joe one thing too its just interesting that we were talking about was if you look at the parts business specifically the parts business is actually growing but quite slowly just above lowsingle digits really lowsingle digits and youre seeing just a ton more replacement whether its on the residential side or even on the commercial side of the business where highmargin parts business people are replacing rather than repairing thats happening across the portfolio too joe ritchie  goldman sachs  co llc helpful thanks guys michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc sure operator the next question comes from steve tusa from jpmorgan your line is open charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc hey guys good morning michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc good morning steve susan k carter  ingersollrand plc morning charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc so if you roll on a month basis the commercial hvac orders youre in that mid to highsingle digit range i know youve talked about a slowing given there is i would assume a longer lead time on some of these bookings in commercial hvac and any color on kind of whether this quarter is a true break in the trend or should we expect given that maybe its an easier comp in the third quarter because of a large deal maybe there werent large ones maybe there were maybe you could clarify that should we be back in that  to  perhaps midsingle digit type of range in orders in the third quarter for commercial hvac michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc yeah i think the market is actually going to grow in that midsingle digit range so thats the market in north america as it stands again i can see slower unitary growth and accelerating applied growth with the wild card being these larger energy services projects that we do at times that can impact the data so the midsingle digit growth rates say a healthy growth rate and if you can do any better than that youre probably gaining share susan k carter  ingersollrand plc and steve we did have one of the contracting bookings in the third quarter of  also it was about half the size of the one in q but it was still good size so youll have a little bit of a tough compare but as mike said earlier well have tough compares on the commercial hvac bookings all year charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc right but the quoting activity is holding up okay i guess is the messaging michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc yes particularly on the applied side institutional side absolutely yes charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc okay so if you look at the margin bridge for the second half you talked about or at least for the year now to reset us you said basically the rest of the year is going to look a lot like q so in the back half of the year up roughly  basis points is that the right way to look at it michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc yeah thats exactly right charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then in the fourth quarter you had it wasnt like the greatest margin performance on the planet i think they were down and you did have some inflation kick in in the fourth quarter it was a  basis point headwind why wouldnt that comp get a little bit easier or is that just timing of raws coming in and then why are you not getting more price in the second half why – you said youre going to put some things through is it just those markets are too tough in international commercial michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc second half investments are about twice the rate of the first half investments were making were really trying to set up  and beyond steve so really on the margin side we could certainly squeeze more leverage out if we took that down but we think weve got good ideas and good projects to do that sue other part of the question anything you want to add there susan k carter  ingersollrand plc yeah so youre right steve as you get into the fourth quarter the comparisons on pricecost are start to lap themselves because that was the first quarter that we saw the negative impact in  but for the entire year which was the guidance we gave in the prepared remarks we still expect to be down about  basis points for the year based on what weve seen in the first half and then what were projecting for the second half charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks a lot operator your next question comes from julian mitchell from credit suisse your line is open julian mitchell  credit suisse securities usa llc hi good morning michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc good morning julian susan k carter  ingersollrand plc morning julian mitchell  credit suisse securities usa llc morning just a question on the productivity and other inflation line within the margin bridge maybe just give us a sense of where you stand on the outlook for that that had been a very big margin driver  and  sort of flattened out last year back to being a good tailwind this year so is that sort of  bps  bps range what we should expect in the second half or are you thinking about trying to step that up to offset potentially a price material headwind that could last sometime into next year michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc yeah total productivity steps up in the back half of the year for sure and thats programmed in so those are projects that are in flight so i feel thats nearin for us a quarter or two out to go look at that thats certainly part of how were trying to ensure that we still grow the operating margin in the back half of the year and again sort of  basis points to  basis points for the full year as well but thats a good pickup julian thats exactly right julian mitchell  credit suisse securities usa llc thank you and then just a followup on my second question would be on the industrial business very good margin performance in the first half guidance suggests a flattening out in the second half so was there any kind of big timing of productivity efforts or particular mix tailwinds you had in industrial in q or the first half that you think doesnt sustain into the back half or is the margin guide in that division really heavily in the context of look youve had a few tough years there and dont want to get ahead yourselves on the recovery in margins michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc well pricevolume mix was all a little bit better than what we had thought so that was certainly positive but theres been a lot of productivity work over the last  months two years in that business and were seeing some of highest productivity now in the company coming through as a result of that some of that has been restructuring and other elements have just been changes to the business model that weve made so its been excellent performance todate we think itll continue but whats a bit of a wild card is just where volume settles out for the back half of the year in terms of how much we can actually shift in the back half of the year susan k carter  ingersollrand plc and we did julian in  we did see the margins start to improve in the back half of the year in industrial so again the first half comparisons are going to be a little bit easier than the second half comparisons but as i look at every line item for the business theyre continuing to improve in the second half of the year all the way down the pl so i think the business is doing exactly what we expected and want it to do in  michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc and ive got a lot of just personal confidence in the way that that team is executing too julian theyre delivering on exactly what was committed to in our may investor day and as i sift through the operating reviews you just see the cadence there and the delivery has been commensurate with that julian mitchell  credit suisse securities usa llc great thank you operator your next question comes from andrew obin from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open andrew burris obin  bank of america merrill lynch yeah good morning can you guys hear me michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc hi andy yeah susan k carter  ingersollrand plc yes good morning andrew burris obin  bank of america merrill lynch yes i just wanted to understand a little bit of volume mix in the second half i guess if i look at the fx benefit for the second half and if i overlay it with your commentary on pricing it seems that i think fx offsets most of the pricing drag and i just want to understand the leverage in the second half just a little bit better i know you said theres some uncertainty about volume is that whats driving it or are you just being conservative on operating leverage i just want to understand that michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc well the leverage is not that different than the first half its marginally better in the back half than in the front half but the largest difference really is in the investments area where again its about twice the rate as the first half andrew burris obin  bank of america merrill lynch gotcha that makes sense and just a question on pricing i think one of the themes this earnings season was that some deflationary pricing in distribution channel from online i know that online is starting to make inroads on residential side what has been your experience with pricing on the residential side in the us as online is growing michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc so far so good if you remember in may we talked about one of the things that consumers really asked for was more transparency in pricing and so we launched and were first to launch now nationally a model where weve worked with our dealers to be able give homeowners a fairly tight range of what an installed system would look like and were seeing uptake on that from the web were seeing close rates that are well above what they were in the conventional way so look i think that simplifying the consumer experience and being more transparent around that is a good thing and its something that we intend to lead andor participate in with other leading companies that think that way andrew burris obin  bank of america merrill lynch terrific thank you michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc thank you operator the next question comes from robert barry from susquehanna your line is open robert d barry  susquehanna financial group lllp hey guys good morning michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc hey robert susan k carter  ingersollrand plc good morning robert d barry  susquehanna financial group lllp just a followup on the price question i understand the international dynamic in applied but why not go for a meatier price hike in resi especially since the market there seems so strong michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc well resi is covering material inflation and expanding margins and growing share i wish we would have got  basis points more of growth we could have said it was  we had a heck of a good quarter i dont think we need to do anything different there other than continue to do what were doing and execute the way weve been executing so i feel like thats in good shape and i think the industry is in good shape robert d barry  susquehanna financial group lllp got you and then just on the investments x i think you said in second half but if inflation continues to track even higher outside of steel which sounds fairly locked in what are the thoughts on flexing some of that up or down versus accepting some lower margin nearterm michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc i think we need to manage the whole income statement to deliver on the commitment we gave at the beginning of the year so were halfway through the year were now at the top end of our guidance range which is a good thing and as long as weve got good investments for the long run were going to make those investments i think its happened to us before where the fourth quarters rolled around and there was an opportunity to do something good for the business in the long run and weve done that so were not going to sacrifice a quarter to make a consensus number thats for sure but we are going to go deliver on the commitments weve made which were doing this year and hopefully we can top those susan k carter  ingersollrand plc and robert i would add that one of the things that i think we do a good job of and are putting some tools in to actually continue to improve on the investment is we look at the investment versus the financial criteria and the returns that theyre going to give to us not necessarily their impact it does factor into the pl and were very conscious of that but were looking at each of the projects for how it fits into the strategy and what kind of returns its going to bring over the  guidance that we gave at our investor day so i think thats something we do very well and were very conscious of how that all fits together but it isnt just a look at the pl its also a look at strategy and the longerterm plan that goes along with that so i think we do that pretty well robert d barry  susquehanna financial group lllp fair enough thank you operator the next question will come from tim wojs from baird your line is open timothy ronald wojs  robert w baird  co inc hey everybody good morning i just had a clarification and then a question just on the share repurchase and the acquisition activity the  billion that you talked about for this year i just wanted to clarify that only the yeartodate numbers are actually in guidance michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc correct the yeartodate is where we were as of today in terms of share buyback the acquisitions of  million is where we are in terms of buyback the  million sic  billion  is still the commitment on total deployment the  million to  million of actionable and affordable ma is still what were looking at although theres been changes within the pipeline its still  million to  million if i snapped a line today as compared to last quarter i would tell you that the biasing would be much more close to the  million than it would the  million that would be really the update i would give you here timothy ronald wojs  robert w baird  co inc okay great and then just on thermo king youve actually seen order growth in two of the last three quarters and so is that business really at a bottom in your eyes and against easier comparisons in the back half of the year and into  can we actually start to see growth accelerate now in that business michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc well its a very diverse business so you have to think about what part of thermo king are you talking about and what were seeing right now is really excellent growth in areas like auxiliary power unit bookings or in total aftermarket or in the total truck business so remember that tk is not just a trailer business but its a class  through  truck business and that business is up highteens for us the truck business weve got other in there which is bus rail and air so there are a number of positives and again youre comping at a little better its just a touch better north american market than we thought a weaker emea than we thought particularly western europe a stronger eastern europe than we thought net were just slightly right on slightly above where we thought we would be for the total year timothy ronald wojs  robert w baird  co inc okay great good luck on the second half michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc thanks operator your next question comes from robert mccarthy from stifel your line is open robert paul mccarthy  stifel nicolaus  co inc good morning mike im going to skip the breakup question michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc good robert robert paul mccarthy  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah i figured you had enough of that one maybe a history lesson though in terms of bookings obviously youve rejiggered the presentation effectively this quarter but just a context around the commercial bookings maybe first half of this year what would the overall growth and complexion would be because i hate to be pedantic or didactic but i just wanted – you had a very tough compare q last year incredible growth so just maybe some clarity around the firsthalf bookings to underscore still the strength there michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc yeah so quarter one you had highsingle digit global commercial hvac bookings quarter two pull out  million single contract youre up at  growth in quarter two and then look the outlook for the balance of the year continues to be strong against tough comps robert paul mccarthy  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah q  you had pretty explosive commercial bookings as i recall it was in the  to  range if memory serves right in north america michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc quarter one  but yes as you got into north america you got into a  growth number compared to quarter two of last year so thats probably what youre thinking about is the  from last year in quarter two in north america robert paul mccarthy  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah no i think good performance on very tough compares and then could you just comment a little bit about the volume assumptions you did have with respect to commodities i mean how did you outperform there in terms of what your volume assumptions were for the quarter versus what actual volumes were any kind of complexion around that michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc yeah robert i would say to go through the whole business that way would be difficult to do it probably on a call but again we didnt plan on roughly  residential hvac growth in the quarter we didnt plan on the commercial unitary business delivering at the rates that it did so the strategy there is working across our commercial unitary business were growing nicely there the north america commercial unitary business in the quarter grew doubledigit again so we werent forecasting doubledigit again off a doubledigit growth prior year in the commercial north america unitary business were just seeing strong markets and well above our projections the really exciting thing for me is that we were able to execute on that flawlessly we took that volume we worked with suppliers we ran our operations in plants at meaningfully higher revenues than we had thought and executed well the only downside to that was youre out in the spot market picking up steel copper and aluminum thats about it robert paul mccarthy  stifel nicolaus  co inc and then finally for  thinking about the levels of investments that youve highlighted this year and obviously the price and material headwinds if we go into  obviously youre not giving guidance today i understand that but can we talk qualitatively about the factors that would suggest would you expect a return to kind of the incrementals on the climate side of the house that weve expected to enjoy there if you see continued growth and we have a stepup in the spend or maybe you can comment on the rd and overall investment spending youve been doing and whether its going to level off in  michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc the longrange plans for the business is going out three years and capturing  if you look at the growth side led by product growth teams the answer that were always – the question were asking is what do we do to grow share and grow margins at the same time and projects that qualify for that by teams that execute well are going to be approved so if you look at it from the growth side the incremental investments look like the last three years we still have good ideas to go execute on the productivity side were making sure that the productivity investments are sufficient enough to create a gap over other inflation including wage labor so thats the operating system thats our model thats how we look at this as we look out theres not a lot of difference about how you would model that for us itd be incremental investment for growth and it would be incremental investment in productivity to offset other inflation and then price material whole different part of the operating system this will be a tough year its a bit of an unusual year but i just dont think long term that its going to remain upsidedown for us robert paul mccarthy  stifel nicolaus  co inc congratulations on the quarter and the context of the continuing strong results michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc thank you operator your next question comes from jeffrey sprague from vertical research your line is open jeffrey todd sprague  vertical research partners llc thank you good morning michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc hi jeff jeffrey todd sprague  vertical research partners llc hi lots of ground to cover here just a couple things mike the growth in building services does that reflect the beginning of the execution of the big projects you booked last year and whether the answer is yes or no are you building backlog in that business michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc yeah the main area actually was in all of the other service areas that would be everything from planned service to breakfix to smaller turnkey contracting and thats the return on investment for the feet on the street for all of the controls people we put out in the marketplace to sell all of the service technicians that weve grown i want to say in north america were up  to  technicians maybe more at this point yearoveryear were seeing industryleading revenue per technician and margin per technician so again its a strategy of the business to continue to invest there at those higher margins jeffrey todd sprague  vertical research partners llc so on the bigger projects youre not even really starting to see revenue on those correct michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc yeah theyre so long in nature and they are fairly linear in terms of how you execute something like that typically if its an building project youre doing that in phases and chunks so its squeezing its way through the income statement and some of those projects were month month maybe longer projects so it happens over two years twoandahalf years jeffrey todd sprague  vertical research partners llc just kind of a technical one for sue i think you said fx only kind of half the fleet average margin rate that sounds a little atypical relative to other companies i cover is there something with hedges working against that or some other technicality that drives that phenomenon susan k carter  ingersollrand plc no actually it doesnt what it really reflects is our inregion forregion strategy so in other words your costs and your revenues are largely in the same currency and so what that means is when you translate out the revenues that youre really translating the income at the operating income level so it includes the cost side of that versus just at the gross margin level so a bit of a nuance but nothing more than straight math jeffrey todd sprague  vertical research partners llc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of josh pokrzywinski with wolfe research your line is open josh pokrzywinski  wolfe research llc hi good morning guys thanks for fitting me in here michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc hey josh josh pokrzywinski  wolfe research llc i guess first question mike on some of the big performance contracting orders that you booked last year that set up the tough comp im to understand those are fairly lower margin relative to the base business does that show up in an easier margin comp somewhere along the way that we should keep in mind as well michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc it shows up in lower gross margins it should show up in contribution margin being about the same so you tend to have all elements of cost set against that particular contract so theres very little incremental i mean even the commissions and the sale are part of the cost structure of the contract so we look at those to be accretive to the overall margins on a contribution basis but it would put pressure on your gross margins for sure josh pokrzywinski  wolfe research llc is that something we lap here in the second half or is that just spread over multiple quarters michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc its a little bit to jeffs question when you book these things at the  million point youre getting a quarter a point where it can really move your comps on bookings but if you take those projects over  months  months youre really seeing the pl impact in ths or ths over the course of that contract so its very much sort of diluted coming through the income statement over time does that help you at all josh pokrzywinski  wolfe research llc yeah it does thats helpful to follow up on another one of jeffs questions on the currency front a lot of companies weve seen have gotten pretty decent pricing over the last couple years in a stronger dollar environment is that some of whats going on with the tougher pricing environment internationally just maybe its tougher to price through inflation given that youve already priced through currency is that dynamic playing out at all for you or because its purely translational that doesnt show up michael w lamach  ingersollrand plc we tend to produce and sell in region at those currencies we do very little exporting around the world in various currencies the only exception to that is theres some middle east orders that will come out of the us as an example but generally speaking youre operating in the same currency so to us its much much more translational than transactional susan k carter  ingersollrand plc right and i think josh when you think about it in some of the areas that weve been talking about in the world youre going to have a competitive pricing environment so thats a given and then youre going to be buying your raw materials in that region again so youre going to locally source in china or some of the other countries so youre getting both ends of that dynamic whatever the region is telling you so its not really a translational or fx type of activity its really if youre manufacturing in the region youre going to get the full cost side as well as the full revenue side josh pokrzywinski  wolfe research llc understood thanks for the color operator we have reached the end of our questionandanswer session i will now turn the call back to mr nagle for closing remarks zachary a nagle  ingersollrand plc great id like to thank everyone for joining us for todays call

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
