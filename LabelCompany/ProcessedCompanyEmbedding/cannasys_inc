will cannasys inc otcmktsmjtk’s latest product citizen toke make a mark in cannabis market by emily gibson  in marijuana  on tuesday  jan   am   comment cannasys inc otcmktsmjtk is a company which is often termed as a player in the cannabis market in the last quarter of  the company launched it new product called citizen toke in the colorado market in the times when the legal cannabis debate is the hottest trend in the us and there is so much of gamble riding in this industry citizen toke is something that may or may not leave it imprint in the canvas of consumers’ mind but there is no harm in trying isn’t it conjunction of mobile platform and cannabis market how easy would it be if a cannabis patient or a consumer finds the coupons or discount deals through his own mobile phone well citizen toke is a new product of the company that brings easy deals and sells off discount coupons to the patients and consumers of the cannabis market through its unique text message based system it is primarily a mobile web based platform which ensures that its customers get a peep into the retail experience of this industry of course the company earns its value through download of this product the consumers are presented with the incentives to download while they can also redeem coupons on milestones or timely way why capital toke remains devoid of finance cannasys inc had acquired this product from betakillers llc in  august since then there has been recapitalization for capital toke but without luck the company is hoping for extensive market penetration of this product which would mean that it may possibly generate income for the company why colorado colorado and also california are two places where legalization debate has remained a hot stuff among the citizens the launch of citizen toke in colorado came during the holiday break with an objective of ensuring a successful launch the company ceo michael tew calls it an “important and core product” of the company the company made colorado its beta launch partner with a hope to ensure that their product will work well let’s see what the times ahead bring for this one now trendingadvertise hereour authors beat the stock

could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and accordingly such results may differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made herein these risks and uncertainties include those relating to our liquidity requirements the continued growth of the software industry the success of our product development marketing and sales activities vigorous competition in the software industry dependence on existing management leverage and debt service including sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates domestic or global economic conditions the inherent uncertainty and costs of prolonged arbitration or litigation and changes in federal or state tax laws or the administration of such laws introduction we create develop and commercialize innovative solutions for the expanding medical and recreational cannabis community our solutions enhance customer service and provider efficiency including customer loyalty software applications create producer and retailer opportunities through the distribution of our own retail brands and assist with marketing and branding for product companies we do not grow distribute or sell cannabis or products containing cannabis

provider problems create producer and retailer opportunities build retail customer loyalty and streamline the connections among the producer seller and consumerpatient segments for the growing medical and recreational cannabis community since organization we have focused on raising capital creating new products building marketing and distribution capability and channels and pursuing complementary

recognized as a reverse acquisition of the company by the predecessor private company this discussion relates to the financial statements of the privately held predecessor entity for all periods before the reverse acquisition results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   revenue and costs of goods sold our revenue was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of  or  the decrease is largely attributed to a decrease in revenue from software development revenue has been generated through a combination of software development and consulting services related to custombuilt software we generate the majority of our revenue from custom software development related to cannalims ongoing recurring contracts for bumpup rewards and custom development related to bumpup rewards whitelabel applications for the year ended december   we did not generate a material amount of revenue from our strategic relationships our cost of goods sold was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively operating expenses stockbased compensation expense was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively representing a decrease of  or  in  stockbased compensation expense is from warrants issued to officers consultants and other service providers in the current year fewer warrants were issued thereby decreasing our expense professional fees were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively representing an increase of  or  in  the increase in  as compared to  can be largely attributed to increased legal and audit fees related to increased transactions fundraising and reporting activities salary and wage expense was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of  or  in  the decrease in  as compared to  is due to a reduction in salaried employees in the beginning of  general and administrative expense was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively an increase of  or  in  the increase in  as compared to  can be attributed to increased consulting and other outside service expense other income and expense for the year ended december   we had total other expense of  compared to  for the year ended december   for the year ended december   we recorded interest expense of  compared to  for the prior year and an impairment loss on investment of  compared to  for the prior year in addition as a result of convertible promissory notes we recorded interest expense on debt discount of  in  compared to  for the prior year and a loss on the issuance of convertible debt of  compared to  for the prior year net loss for the year ended december   we had a net loss of  as compared to a net loss of  in the prior year an increase of  or  in  this increase is the direct result of the additional expense attributable to the issuance of convertible notes liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we used cash of  in operating activities as compared to  for the year ended december   we did not use cash in investing activities during the year ended december   as compared to  used in investing activities during the year ended december   financing activities provided cash of  during the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   our current business expenses average approximately  per month excluding capital expenditures specific to new product launches we continue to focus on reducing our monthly business expenses through cost reductions and operational streamlining currently we do not have enough cash on hand to sustain our business operations and alongside expected revenue we expect to access external capital resources in the near future at the moment we are seeing increased adoption across our business lines but we cannot guarantee this will continue we anticipate also accessing the capital markets in order to fund future research and development as well as expand product offerings to include future versions of products and possible acquisitions of ancillary products and services to the extent that funding is available we have budgeted  for capital expenditures and other costs during the next  months consisting of  for enhanced software development and marketing for afn  for debt retirement and if necessary to provide for refinancing or extensions of our existing debt including principal and any interest due under the terms of our current financing agreements with our capital partners and  for legal audit and accounting expenses we may seek additional debt financing although we cannot guarantee what structures our sources of financing may choose in the future and there is no guarantee we will be able to secure additional funding in addition the vast majority of our debt is convertible into common stock in which case we will not have to retire it the investors are able to convert the debt into our shares if we were to retire all of our outstanding debt including the convertible promissory notes and pay the maximum potential interest due we would need to budget approximately  we anticipate that we will fund a portion of these costs from proceeds from projected revenues as well as from the sale of common stock to kodiak capital group llc under our equity purchase agreement and other potential sources it is possible that additional external cash will be required during the next  months particularly if we seek to develop new products need to fund new strategic relationships or enter new markets not now anticipated or if projected revenues are not realized our efforts are focused on increasing revenue while we explore external funding alternatives as our current cash is insufficient to fund operations for the next  months although our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we feel that our revenue potential is sufficient for our business to continue as a going concern however in order to expand our product offerings we expect that we will require additional investments and revenue as we continue to develop new products and identify specific commercialization opportunities we will focus on those product markets and opportunities for which we might be able to get external funding through joint venture agreements strategic partnerships or other direct investments off balance sheet arrangements as of december   there were no off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations the list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america with no need for managements judgment in their application the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see the notes to our december   financial statements note that our preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we cannot assure that actual results will not differ from those estimates stockbased compensation we account for equitybased transactions with nonemployees under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  equitybased payments to nonemployees asc  establishes that equitybased payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the fair value of common stock issued for payments to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the date of grant the fair value of equity instruments other than common stock is estimated using the blackscholes option valuation model in general we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract we account for employee stockbased compensation in accordance with the guidance of asc  compensationstock compensation which requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values the fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paidin capital over the period during which services are rendered revenue recognition and cost of goods sold we follow asc s revenue recognition for revenue recognition we will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured during the fiscal year  we generated revenue from  customized software development software developed for customers on a custommade basis and we allocated cost of goods sold for both forms of revenue on a pro rata basis through either direct outsourcing of development resources or direct costs associated with our employees or contractors income taxes we follow asc  income taxesinitial measurement which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of income in the period that includes the enactment date we adopted asc  income taxesrecognition asc  addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under asc  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement asc  also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes and accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures we had no material adjustments to our liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of asc  recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  august  april
