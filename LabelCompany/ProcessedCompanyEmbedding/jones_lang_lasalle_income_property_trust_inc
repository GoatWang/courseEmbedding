uncertain and there is no assurance that future distributions will be made we may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations including without limitation the sale of assets borrowings or offering proceeds our use of leverage increases the risk of your investment if we fail to maintain our status as a reit and no relief provisions apply we would be subject to serious

essential investment learn why real estate is an essential investment summary of risk factors you should read the prospectus carefully for a description of the risks associated with an investment in jll income property trust some of these risks include but are not limited to the following since there is no public trading market for shares of our common stock repurchases of shares by us after a oneyear minimum holding period will likely be the only way to dispose of your shares after a required oneyear holding period we limit the amount of shares that may be repurchased under our repurchase plan to approximately  of our net asset value nav per quarter and  of our nav per annum because our assets will consist primarily of properties that generally cannot be readily liquidated we may not have sufficient liquid resources to satisfy repurchase requests further our board of directors may modify or suspend our repurchase plan if it deems such action to be in the best interest of our stockholders as a result our shares have limited liquidity and at times may be illiquid the purchase and redemption price for shares of our common stock will be based on the nav of each class of common stock and will not be based on any public trading market because valuation of properties is inherently subjective our nav may not accurately reflect the actual price at which our assets could be liquidated on any given day we are dependent on our advisor to conduct our operations we will pay substantial fees to our advisor which increases your risk of loss we have a history of operating losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability our advisor will face conflicts of interest as a result of among other things time constraints allocation of investment opportunities and the fact that the fees it will receive for services rendered to us will be based on our nav which it is responsible for calculating the amount of distributions we make is uncertain and there is no assurance that future distributions will be made we may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations including without limitation the sale of assets borrowings or offering proceeds our use of leverage increases the risk of your investment if we fail to maintain our status as a reit and no relief provisions apply we would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences that would cause a significant reduction in our cash available for distribution to our stockholders and potentially have a negative impact on our nav forwardlooking statement disclosure this
