framework and checklists to guide statutory proposals that would allow calrecycle and other stakeholders to implement product stewardship programs extended producer responsibility epr also known as product stewardship is a strategy to place a shared responsibility for endoflife product management on the producers and all entities involved in the product chain instead of the general public while encouraging product design changes that minimize a negative impact on human health and the environment at every stage of the products lifecycle this allows the costs of treatment and disposal to be incorporated into the total cost of a product it places primary responsibility on the producer or brand owner who makes design and marketing decisions it also creates a setting for markets to emerge that truly reflect the environmental impacts of a product and to which producers and consumers respond on march   a california assembly hearing was held to discuss epr policy and featured testimony from a wide variety of experts including representatives from manufacturers stewardship organizations retailers local government and environmental groups the discussion covered the economic and environmental impacts of epr in other regions and how california could benefit from this policy it highlighted that new jobs are created not merely shifted from one company to another calrecycles efforts over the years calrecycles predecessor the california integrated waste management board engaged in a variety of program activities concerning products and their impact on the environment these efforts continue as calrecycle seeks a comprehensive approach for advancing epr building upon the efforts elsewhere in the world most calrecycle activities in the past have focused on better managing the impacts of product discards rather than focusing on how to eliminate waste in the first place epr is a waste reduction strategy by shifting costs and responsibilities of product discards to producers and others who directly benefit epr provides an incentive to eliminate waste and pollution through product design changes it allows calrecycle to better carry out its mission for the citizens of california in february  the california integrated waste management board adopted a set of strategic directives that included strategic directive  producer responsibility this policy directs staff to seek statutory authority to foster cradletocradle producer responsibility and develop producerfinanced and producermanaged systems for product discards numerous local governments in california have demonstrated their support by adopting producer responsibility resolutions hosted by the california product stewardship council epr framework and checklist serve as a guide for proposals that seek statutory changes that would allow calrecycle and other stakeholders to implement product stewardship programs the epr framework covers the following topics goals guiding

while others are starting to identify the positive attributes of the experienced economy its what weve been doing since our inception this heritage gives us a clear competitive advantage our final headline cnl lifestyle transaction completed on april  we completed the cnl lifestyle transaction significantly increasing the diversity of our recreation segment with high quality ski and attraction assets on april  approximately  million of our shares were distributed to the retail shareholders of cnl and to those shareholders who may be joining us for the first time i want to say welcome to the epr family as we spoken about in the past we were very deliberate in our approach to this transaction our team of dedicated professionals spent countless hours getting the underwriting and valuation right to ensure the steady and reliable lease performance that will drive results for years to come this transaction demanded support from all of our functional areas it really was a team effort and i cannot be prouder of their discipline dedication and effort ill now turn it over to jerry for a further discussion of our investments and portfolio jerry earnest thank you greg during the first quarter of  investment spending was  million and set a company record for first quarter investment spending the strong spending pace for the first quarter reflects the continued momentum within each of our primary investment segments and represents a compelling start toward our investment guidance for the year furthermore we are excited to confirm the closing of the cnl lifestyle transaction during the second quarter which complements our portfolio of recreation investments and accounts for more than half of our projected investment spending for  in the entertainment segment the theater exhibition business posted solid growth in the first quarter box office revenues are up  yeartodate over the same period last year there is great excitement in the theater exhibition business for the balance of the year with eagerly anticipated movie sequels such as guardians of the galaxy  the new pirates of the caribbean sequel cars  transformers spiderman and of course star wars the last jedi among others for the first quarter investment spending in our entertainment segment totaled  million consisting primarily build the suit development and redevelopment of multiplex theaters entertainment retail centers and family entertainment centers the high amenity theater format has been a great success with consumers and has increased revenue generation with these new offers we continue to partner with our exhibition operators in the deployment of the high amenity theaters our strategy involves three primary avenues for investment first the redevelopment of theaters within our existing portfolio of which we have seven currently and foresee increased opportunity as our operating partners increase the velocity of conversions the second opportunity is the build to construction of the theaters and finally the acquisition of existing theaters from third parties with a commitment from theater operators to redevelop the theater and extend the lease term each of these strategies leverages our knowledge and relationships to further strengthen our portfolio and additional benefit of these efforts is that we are substantially extending the lease term of our assets we remain the largest landlord for the three biggest exhibitors in the us amc cinemark and regal this positions us quite well for both stability and ongoing growth opportunities in summary the company had over  billion invested in the entertainment segment with six properties under development  properties in service and  operators during the first quarter our recreation segment continued to tap into the consumer preference for affordable experiences topped off properties maintain their superior performance with strong overall lease coverage we continue to be impressed by the compelling consumer acceptance rather than ramp up and reliable performance of our topgolf investments we currently have five topgolf properties under construction  opened and operating properties ski operators are wrapping up what has been a very productive year and although the final results will not be available until next quarter we anticipate the portfolio’s revenue and visitation to be up at least  and coverage to be at least two times further all of our tenants have fully funded their off season reserves in addition during the quarter we invested  million in two fitness clubs the fitness club business is a property type within our recreation segment that we have been evaluating for a number of years we have been patient and disciplined waiting for the right fitness club opportunity and are excited to enter this growing business we view the fitness category as a natural fit within our portfolio that taps into active lifestyle demographic trends we also acquired two ifly facilities totaling  million during the first quarter ifly is an exciting indoor skydiving operator that pioneered this experience over  years ago and now has a total of  facilities worldwide our relationship with ifly has been in development for several years and we are excited about the opportunities to invest in properties that combine a worldclass experience with a proven  year track record of success recreation spending totaled  million during the first quarter which primarily consisted of buildtosuit development of golf course entertainment complexes and attractions redevelopment of ski areas and the fitness and ifly transactions i just discussed in summary at quarter end the company had over  billion invested in the recreation segment with seven properties under development  properties n service and nine operators subsequent to the end of the first quarter we completed the major transaction with cnl lifestyle and ochziff real estate the company acquired the premier northstar california resort  water parks and amusement parks additionally we provided a fiveyear  secured debt financing to ochziff for its purchase of  ski properties five small family entertainment centers that were part of the acquisition portfolio were sold simultaneously with the closing of the transaction the aggregate investment was over  million of which over  was funded with common equity we are excited that this transaction significantly expands our investment in the recreation segment with high quality properties and a number of the operators further this portfolio provides a high level diversification by product geography and operator to our existing recreation portfolio this transaction also demonstrates opportunities to partner with investment firms such as ochziff as a move with greater focus into the experienced economy during the first quarter we continued to see attractive opportunities for investment spending across our education facilities platform consisting of public charter schools building childhood education facilities and private schools as we have stated previously we believe that our experience in the sector and extensive operator relationships combined with our buildtosuit program provides us with a competitive advantage and further growing on our high quality portfolio of education facilities during the first quarter investment spending in our education segment totaled  million primarily consisting of buildtosuit development and redevelopment of public charter schools early childhood education centers and private schools as discussed on our last call we are in discussions with early childhood education tenant to adjust their lease terms and provide them the flexibility to deal with some challenges brought on by their rapid expansion and related ramp up to stabilization the situation is complicated by the tenant having multiple landlords so we have made progress in these discussions and anticipate having a resolution by our next earnings call both our first quarter results and our guidance reflect our best estimate of how this matter is likely to be resolved as noted on our prior call no early childhood education tenant contributed more than  of the companys revenues in  and no early childhood education is planned to contribute more than  in the companys  plan in summary the company had over  billion invested in the education segment with  properties under developed  properties in services and  operators construction continues to progress steadily with the planned opening of the montreign resort casino by empire resorts on or before march   montreign resort casino is designed to meet  star and  diamond standards and includes  story hotel a casino floor and entertainment space earlier this month montreign resort casino announced that is entered into a license agreement to be rebranded as are a resorts world property which we believe is a really positive move the branding and licensing as a resorts world property will enable montreign resort casino to leverage the internationally recognized resorts world hospitality and casino brand development also continues on the water park hotel site located in the adelaar casino and resort development with an anticipated opening in early  we invested approximately  million on this development during the quarter in terms of recycling capital during the first quarter we sold three properties for  million primarily consisting of two educational properties for a net gain of  million in addition during the quarter there were mortgage note receivable paid downs of  million bringing our disposition proceeds to a total of  million we have a number of pending disposition transactions that we’ve previously discussed which we anticipate closing during the second and third quarters i want to reconfirm our guidance for  disposition proceeds remains  to  million including  million in sales of existing imagine schools through a third party as mentioned on our previous call with the closing of this transaction our imagine exposure including the outstanding note and remaining properties is expected to be less than  of our investment portfolio property occupancy for all our properties remain strong at  in summary the overall business in each of our segments remain strong and solid and consistent investment opportunities with durable growth profiles were maintaining our guidance for  investment spending of  billion to  billion inclusive of the recent cnl investment with that ill turn it over to mark for a discussion of the financials and i will rejoin you for questions mark peterson thank you jerry id like to remind everyone on the call that our quarterly investor supplemental can be downloaded from our website now turning to first slide net income for the first quarter was  million or  per share compared to  million or  per share in the prior year ffo was  million compared to  million in the prior year lastly ffos adjusted for the quarter increased to  million versus  million in the prior year and was  per share for the quarter versus  per share in the prior year an increase of  before i walk through the key variances i want to discuss certain of the adjustments to ffo to come to ffo as adjusted first pursuant to tenant purchase options we completed the sale of two public charter schools during the quarter for net proceeds of  million a recognized termination fees included on gain on sale of  million second our transaction costs were only  for the quarter lower than previously anticipated prior to this quarter we had expected to classify the cnl transaction as a business combination and accordingly the expense related transaction costs as incurred however the fasb recently revised the definition of business allowing us to classify this transaction as an asset acquisition beginning january  of this year therefore we capitalized cnl transaction cost in the first quarter and will do so for other related cnl transaction costs incurred subsequent to quarter end note that while this change impacts reported nareit defined ffo it has no impact on ffo as adjusted as expense transaction costs are added back for purposes of this calculation now let me walk through the key line item variances for the quarter versus the prior year our total revenue increased  compared to the prior year to  million within the revenue category rental revenue increased  million versus the prior year to  million and resulted primarily from new investments percentage rents for the quarter included in rental revenue were  versus  in the prior year the increase was primarily due to percentage rents received related to our private schools as in prior years we expect percentage rents to be much higher in the second half of the year versus the first half other income decreased by around  for the quarter versus last year and was primarily due to insurance recovery gains recognized in the prior year that were excluded from ffo as adjusted mortgage and other financing income was  million for the quarter a decrease of approximately  million versus the prior year the decrease was primarily due to mortgage note payoffs in  that included a  million prepayment fee in the first quarter as well as the sale of nine public charter school properties in  that were classified as direct financing leases our additional real estate lending activities during  and  partially offset these decreases on the expense side our property operating expense increased by  versus the prior year primarily due to higher bad debt expense as well as higher property operating expenses at our multitenant properties versus the prior year ga expense increased to  million for the quarter compared to  million in the prior year due primarily to increases in our payroll and benefit costs and professional fees the increase in payroll and benefit costs are due to the additional personnel to support our growing asset base as well as increases in amortization of sharebased awards our net interest expense for the quarter increased by  million to  million this increase resulted primarily from higher average borrowings income tax expense of  for the quarter primarily relates to our canadian owned properties and taxable reit subsidiaries the current income tax expense for the quarter was  versus  in the prior year and as the amount included as a reduction of ffo as adjusted the remainder in both period relates to deferred income tax which is excluded from ffo as adjusted now turning the next slide i’ll review some of the companys key credit ratios as you can see our coverage ratios continue to be strong with fixed coverage at  times debt service coverage at  times interest coverage at  and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio at  times these ratios were less prior year on our typical levels as it was anticipated that significant equity would be issued post quarter and in conjunction with the cnl asset acquisition and that this equity issuance would have the impact of significantly strengthening these ratios this in fact happened as anticipated upon the close of the cnl transaction on april  as we issued approximately  million of common shares accordingly our balance sheet continues to be in great shape lastly as greg mentioned in the headlines we increased our monthly common dividend by over  in the first quarter to an annualized dividend of  in  and our ffo as adjusted payout ratio was  this marks the seventh consecutive year with a significant dividend increase now i’ll turn the next slide to capital markets and liquidity update at quarterend we had total outstanding debt of  billion  of this debt is either fixed rate debt or debt that has been fixed through interest rate swaps with a blended coupon of approximately  we had  million draw at quarterend on our  million line of credit and we had  million of unrestricted cash on hand during the quarter we prepaid in full two secured mortgage notes payable for  million with an average interest rate of  and subsequent to yearend we prepaid in full five secured mortgage notes payable for  million which were secured by  theater properties after these pay downs we have  million in maturities through  with manageable maturities thereafter and we expect to be substantially out of existing secured debt by the end of  additionally during the quarter we issued approximately  common shares under a direct stock purchase plan for net proceeds of  million combined with the shares we issued in the cnl asset acquisition we have issued over  million of common shares in  at very little cost turning to next slide we are confirming our guidance for  ffo as adjusted per share of  to  and our guidance for investment spending of  billion to  billion our earnings guidance continues to take into account expected dispositions in  of a range of  million to  million as jerry discussed guidance for  is detailed on page  of the supplemental now with that ill turn it back over to greg for his closing remarks greg silvers thank you mark as i previously stated in my headlines our unique business model of focused execution continues to allow us to identify access and acquire quality assets that are supported by strong underlying demand we believe that these trends will only get stronger and that we are uniquely and well positioned to take advantage of it with that ill open it up for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from anthony paolone from jpmorgan your line is open anthony paolone i guess first question is on childrens learning adventure and it not being on your major tenant roster anymore can you just tell us how youre counting for it or just how that plays into guidance numbers at this point greg silvers yeah tony what we said and what we continue to say is that theres no doubt we have reduced the number based upon our estimates of discussions of how this will resolve itself as you point out the numbers are pretty readily apparent that we have with that weve taken a reduction in that i dont think as this is still in negotiations to kind of talk about specifics of what in fact that we have done is to our benefit to discuss it on the call but it is noted that we have been conservative in our approach we believe and will have more details as we reach finalization of that anthony paolone and in the meantime though thinking about maintaining your guidance what was the offset or was this contemplated when you gave guidance perhaps greg silvers i think again we did kind of contemplate it as we talked at the end of the year we were aware of it i think theres  we think theres strength in the rest of our ability to deliver on what weve talked about and we kind of at the time we talked at the end of the year knew what was coming and contemplated and as we discussed on our fourth quarter wrap up call gave our best estimate of how we thought this would resolve and we still feel comfortable with that anthony paolone and then on both the fitness side and with ifly can you talk about whether theres any unique arrangements with either of those tenants for future stores or anything like that kind of like what you did with topgolf or were these just straight up deals greg silvers there is what you kind of figured this out tony we do kind of do that theyre not nearly as large as topgolf i mean again fitness as a category is something that we would probably if we expand more it would want to go further out with more operators but we do have some degree of exclusivity upwards of kind of think of  around  million with an operator thats probably the exposure we want to keep with one operator with ifly were probably closer with the uniqueness of that concept around the  to  million of exclusivity we kind of negotiate those with a mind of what we would like our exposure to be we think its a good concept as jerry indicated weve spent years talking to them asking them to kind of prove the concept out further weve seen repeated examples of their success and we were ready to make some of these initial investments but i wouldnt anticipate that we see the length of that investment being a topgolf like investment this is just a nice add on to our recreation segment anthony paolone okay and on ifly what is it whats the dollar investment and physical size like a typical store and what yields look like mark peterson yeah the yields are kind of mid type yields and the store is a kind of a  to  square foot kind of traditional more  a box with the equipment that they need in interior on that but its again not significant we did two during the quarter for  so you can see that the substantial amount of the investment is the owner operator equipment that we’re not part of anthony paolone okay and then just last question as we kind of hear a lot about malls in retail and department stores and anchors and stuff like that these days do you see that as being competition for some of your concepts whether its a top half going into a rework anchor at a mall or any of the other verticals and how is that  what are your thoughts there these days greg silvers at this point i would tell you right now were probably getting more inbound calls from people who want to work with us and want to know can we use part of their site for development rather than them competing with us on that so at this point its been more about opportunity than it has been about competition operator and our next question comes from david corak from fbr your line is open david corak can you guys give us some color on the demand and transaction volume for indiscernible early education assets out there maybe just some data points on cap rates yields would be helpful has volume or pricing or competition changed much over the past three or six months jerry earnest sure this is jerry the charter schools i mean its still initial cash yield of  to  for us on new projects typically buildtosuit there is not a lot of an acquisition market there but though there are some and an increasing amount volumes in the industry slowed down in terms of net new schools and so forth over the past  months though that appears to be reversing some and the competitive environment really not for people to do what we do so much but from the tax exempt bond market has been pretty pretty hot though it seems to be cooling off a bit here recently so we kind of view this as a bit of a slowdown we sort of anticipated this a while back and i think were going have a steady pick up from here and its a really  still very solid underlying business for us david corak and i think over the last couple of years you mentioned so may onlines you had names and projects and all of your guided spend this year is that still the case or is any of this falling out or has any of it been replaced greg silvers yeah again all of our projects for our investments right now we have names and projects identified through that now what that will do is create the opportunity potentially to drive better numbers for the latter half of the year as we get more visibility to additional transactions but as we sit right now were very comfortable with our spending guidance and our ability to access the deals that will drive those numbers jerry earnest yeah just to talk more about that if you take out cnl which has already happened we have about  million roughly of guidance for noncnl activity and if you count what we did in the first quarter versus what you see on our development pipeline schedule we have about a little under  million of things that have already happened or have been started and they just need to be completed now timing can change on that but that we feel pretty good about that relative to our guidance obviously when we have started such a high percentage of the projects that we have in the plan david corak and then you guys mentioned affordable investments and recreation can you tell us on what the average kind of revenue per person is at a top cost per visit and how does that compare to a run of the mill drive range or some other sort of competitor there greg silvers again dave its all good questions i would tell you you may have noticed that we didnt quote a specific coverage and talking about a specific average spend per customer i think topgolf as they mature and become more thinking forward about how theyre driving their business has asked us to move away from quoting their specific results because we are actually quoting their performance as opposed to when we talk about the theater business when were blending multiple operators together when we talk about the average spend at topgolf or the average spend or the coverage at a topgolf gets directly to kind of their kind of their performance numbers so again i would tell you that they have a very strong contribution from their food and beverage component if you look at kind of its multiple higher than a driving range if you think about whats the offering if you think about from the kind of performance kind of levels that weve been talking about the activity at topgolf is  an hour between six people it’s  per person for the revenue generation that youre doing theres substantial kind of revenue in the food and beverage component that is much higher than what you would see at a typical driving range operator and our next question comes from craig mailman from keybanc your line is open craig mailman hey guys just quickly to start out can you remind us what the lockup period is for the cnl shareholders greg silvers there is no lock up period they began freely trading april  craig mailman and then just a follow up on the fitness and the ifly are those going to be more sale leaseback or are those all kind of new builds greg silvers these were all acquisitions again we may  what is typical of kind of our  as opposed  what you saw with what weve done with new concepts were generally not immediately buying buildtosuit it’s more lets buy something thats existing and then cross default it and create credit support if we go into a build mode so our initial undertaking generally with a new tenant is to buy something existing and improving craig mailman can you guys identify the fitness operator greg silvers the fitness operator is a group called genesis that is a dominant player here in the midwest they are the market leader in some midmarkets and we acquired properties in omaha and kansas city craig mailman and then just lastly i know its been talked about for years there is potential risk out there but just looks like charter is heating up on maybe new release time frames being shortened can you kind of talk about what you guys are seeing there kind of conversations with operators and kind of how you think that affects the business and maybe the pace of the redevelopments and new builds for the hire of theaters greg silvers yeah i would tell you we were at the semicon which is the exhibition conference about two or three weeks ago meeting with the exhibition and distribution again this issue of release windows comes up every three or four years again even at the point theyre talking now theres discussion of something below day there are a lot of opportunities if you saw what happened last year with amc and cineplex and which there were some specific genre type titles mainly last year was horror which again people wanted to get out of the market and get off as soon as it wound down in october the studios worked in agreement with the exhibitors hand in hand and it really was kind of triggering an opportunity to take it off the theater schedule when its income potential fell below a certain level so those discussions continue on i would tell you that everyone  every one of the distributors who presented and i went to all their presentations again maintained the importance of the theater exhibition cycle and preserving that for value and their commitment to creating a window that was sustainable for them and profitable for them them being the exhibition industry so i think again this noise comes up weve dealt with it before the theater exhibition industry has and understands how to do and deal with it and at this point we dont see it as a substantial threat again but they will continue to monitor craig mailman have you guys seen numbers that kind of looks at for a blockbuster in general how much is made in the first three or four weeks and what the trail off is greg silvers what i can tell you is that for the industry generally about  of all theater exhibition first run theater exhibition revenues are made within the first  days craig mailman and then just last one for mark could you give us a breakdown of the balance of the lease term fees when you guys think theyre going to flow through mark peterson so the biggest chunk is in the third quarter and we dont control that exactly so when we say third quarter it could be september and it could flow to the next quarter fourth quarter but it’s third and fourth quarter primarily where those will hit and where we have a plan now is primarily third quarter operator and our next question comes from rob stevenson from janney your line is open rob stevenson thanks guys you’ve got  theaters around  of revenue rolling over ’ and ’ at this point based on your conversations with tenants how is that looking in terms of new lease rental rates versus expiring and what are you sort of expecting in terms of a mark to market there greg silvers i think we feel confident and i will hope to have an update for you next quarter that we have substantially moved all of those into extensions most of those being upgraded to high amenity theaters so we’re working through the documentation on those right now and as i said for most of those that will be putting out capital getting paid on capital and extending the lease for a minimum of ten years rob stevenson okay i know it’s a little early but anything coming out of the administration in terms of hitting your likely to hit the education business positively or negatively that we should be thinking about greg silvers right now we havent seen a whole lot i mean clearly the tone and tenor is positive for school choice and so but they really have not had any education initiatives that they’ve led with within the first  days rob stevenson okay and then just lastly how big are the boxes were talking about for genesis is this one of the sort of smaller square footage the medium sized guys or one of the gigantic  square foot fitness boxes greg silvers these are more of the medium sized kind of market penetration of the area its not one of the big huge boxes its not the retail box either on just the corner these are more the medium size embedded within communities and strong base of participants rob stevenson it’s not like   square feet greg silvers yeah i think  is probably right at around that area as the right number operator operator instructions and our next question comes from nick joseph from citigroup your line is open michael bilerman hey it’s michael bilerman here with nick so i appreciate your commentary on the theatrical release window it just feels as though theres more momentum at this point to shorten this up and use a landlord right if you take the extreme example of whats happening in ecommerce and bricks and mortar retailers the amount of sale that theyre generating in their stores how can that have an impact to your coverage levels to your percentage rents ultimately the distributor was going to come up with some revenue sharing with the studios so theyre going to get protected by shortening that window so theyll be made whole how do you get made whole owning the box which arguably would have less revenues coming into it because theres an alternative to watching those movies greg silvers well michael i get the point the issue is though its different we think its different in retail than i think most people do that theres actually never been a good example of direct to video that has been successful again when you look at that model the model has been built on the ability to do netflix or to do a direct download for  when youre talking about downloads that are  to  to get the first run product this becomes i truly believe more of a discussion of negotiations for film rental terms and using the window as a leverage point then it really does about people wanting to stake out and go to direct to the consumer because that model in every situation that it has been tested in has not been successful michael bilerman right but at some point and as you shorten the window there would be less revenues right that tale and certainly the technology is improving and data speeds are improving and peoples desire in terms of pricing levels may change i’m not doubting that the theater is still going to be a place where people want to go and have an experience and go see a movie i love going to see a movie with my wife all im saying is that there is an element that at some point theres just reduced revenues potentially within your box that the operator is being compensated for separately how do you get that share indiscernible they want to get a piece of the sales that are effectively generated by ecommerce within their trade area okay how are you going to protect yourself and protect epr from the potential where revenues could go away and the coverage levels go down and then the rents abate the operators can pay you would be diminished greg silvers well i think its  first of all i think theres a little bit of something i want to make sure you understand about the model our operators if the distributors go direct without a release window our operators dont participate in that either because again they’ve got a model that would be direct from the distributor leaving out the exhibitor but part of the other issue that and its part of what youre seeing michael with the high amenity conversion where more and more of the revenue stream is being converted from box office revenue to food and beverage and the ability to offset some of those some of the what could potentially be diminished box office returns with higher component of the food and beverage spend michael bilerman which you share and because its done on percentage rent greg silvers yes thats correct operator and our next question comes from dan donlan from ladenburg your line is open dan donlan thank you im just going back to michael’s question these agreements are they kind of with this  between the studios and the operators is it something thats kind of renewed on a yearly basis how does that work in other words if they try it out and lets say they find that it kind of cannibalizes their own revenues and they move back to something how are these agreements greg silvers these actually are agreements that are done film by film by film i mean if you think about actually  the distribution of film product is art not like a good so now most of these contracts the form of the contracts are negotiated for a year or longer but each film and kind of the rental terms as far as what the percentage each one of them will receive is generally on a film by film basis dan donlan okay thats very helpful and then just kind of on the fitness this is a category that a lot of the net lease guys play in so im just curious from a competitive standpoint is there something that youre looking for that some of your peers are not is there a certain component to these fitness centers that maybe make them more unique im just looking at genesis’ website and it seems its a much larger box high amenities all things like that i mean just kind of curious if you could dive a little bit more into what you are looking for from that segment greg silvers sure i think what were looking for and have with him is market dominance within an area to where they are  they control the major part of the market and again have established their brand as opposed to that theyre developing allegiance as opposed to some of the retail shopping that you see in that so again whether its by amenity by or offerings we look at it and say how much of that market do they control and if you look at some of these markets they may control   of the market share so again we’re not buying every facility they have we’re buying a facility of where they have market dominance within an area which gives us we think really strong performance and protection dan donlan okay and then from a cap rate perspective i mean should we assume that these cap rates are going to be probably south of  historically kind of where  your typical investments are between like  to  are these going to be towards the low end of the range and maybe slightly below  greg silvers yeah i would say right at around  is where we would be looking at these dan donlan okay all right and then just curious on the enrollment levels at your charter schools and maybe private schools im not sure if its something that you track school by school but just curious what type of trends that you’ve seen there i would imagine you have the data on the private schools but anything you can kind of offer us there would be helpful jerry earnest i mean we really reported  the numbers typically come in accounts in october november the fall there are lags some time in reporting some of them so we really reported these i believe on the last call but overall charter school enrolments are solid private school enrolments are solid and we really or certainly with our portfolio are meeting expectations and exceeding in many cases so we feel very good about where we are overall the industry is pretty solid when you look at charters as an industry in particular so theres a lot of demand still out there for these core products early ed private schools as well weve picked up a number of them with acquisitions in the fourth and the first quarter in the last six months so we feel very good about the portfolio greg silvers to answer your question a little more yes dan we track enrolments for every school that we have so again i would say generally the trends are positive and upward it doesnt mean that there is not an exception or two out there but we talked about our private school enrollment again when we started with brooklyn a couple of years ago we said it might take four to five years for this to build up to full enrolment while theyre third year this year theyre going to be full so again the enrollment the parents still are looking for quality education and if you can deliver that especially at a private school at values that are greatly below kind of some of the market weve seen substantial kind of movement to fill those seats dan donlan and then just kind of given that growth relative to your expectations have you talked with the operator that you work with to maybe do i mean it seems like youre kind of on a pace to do one private one basis private school a year have you maybe talked with them about increasing that or where does that stand today greg silvers i think its  again fits our needs to kind of grow faster i think we respect the idea that they want to maintain kind of the fidelity of their operation and be able to execute and deliver on that and deliver on the quality that they want to achieve and part of that is their kind of discipline and how they identify and locate teachers and staff these appropriately and dont put stress on the system so i think the answer for us is to find more bases as opposed to drive basis to do more we need to find and we continue to look to expand to find other private school operators who similarly can deliver on their academic kind of requirements without trying to push a tenant to exceed what their capabilities are as far as development jerry earnest and we have several new operators in the last six months weve done business with dan donlan okay thats helpful and then just last question for mark just curious on the guidance you kept the same it hasn’t been narrowed what kind of get you towards the low and the high end it feels like given your disposition range is  million to  million and is it really just going to be kind of timing around these potential sales just kind of curious if you could give us a little bit of color there mark peterson i’d say a couple of things id say timing of sales thats accurate also percentage rents have some fluctuation depending on performance and frankly the resolution of the early ed tenant and that has a range to it that we think weve got accounted for in a conservative fashion but that has some range or bounds to it as well so thats really the primary reasons operator and at this time im showing no further questions greg silvers all right well again we want to thank everyone for their time and attention and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter thank you mark peterson thank you operator
