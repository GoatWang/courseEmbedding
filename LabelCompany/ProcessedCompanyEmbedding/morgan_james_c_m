music product description the sophomore album from morgan james s hunter features the broadway vocalists mix of retrorb and sinfluenced singersongwriter soul ostensibly james debut album hunter actually follows up her  nina simone tribute concert recording morgan james live from dizzys club cocacola that said hunter is james first recording of alloriginal material and in that sense a much more personal statement than her live debut produced by jazz and bluegrass guitarist doug wamble hunter finds james delving deeply into a collection of tunes that while not show tunes in any sense still make clever use of her stagehoned chops it also doesnt hurt that wamble an experienced musician with a wealth of musical skill and crossgenre knowledge has assembled a backing band that features a bevy of heavyweight jazz artists including acclaimed pianist robert glasper saxophonist ron blake trumpeter ravi best and others however rather than having james focus on jazz standards or even jazzinfluenced pop songs wamble helped the vocalist craft an rbinflected album that brings to mind classic artists like carole king and hall  oates as well as more contemporary singers including beyonc� and the late amy winehouse james who made her broadway debut in  alongside nathan lane in the addams family has a big resonant voice with a ton of flexibility perfectly suited for such crisp soulful cuts as heart shake and bring yourself to me elsewhere she delves into several equally compelling bluesy midtempo numbers including you never lied and drown ultimately its that voice  matched with wambles superb musical vision  that creates the soulful exuberant vibe of hunter  matt collarpersonnel morgan james vocals background vocals recording information brooklyn recording brooklyn ny

many partners over the years such as george w perkins but always remained firmly in charge his process of taking over troubled businesses to reorganize them became known as morganization morgan reorganized business structures and management in order to return them to profitability his reputation as a banker and financier also helped bring interest from investors to the businesses that he took over treasury goldedit the federal treasury was nearly out of gold in  at the depths of the panic of  morgan had put forward a plan for the federal government to buy gold from his and european banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis morgan sure there was not enough time to implement such a plan demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with grover cleveland where he pointed out the government could default that day if they didnt do something morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed morgan and the rothschilds to sell gold directly to the us treasury  million ounces to restore the treasury surplus in exchange for a year bond issue the episode saved the treasury but hurt clevelands

the financially struggling new york times steeledit j p morgan in his earlier years after the death of his father in  morgan took control of j s morgan  co which was renamed morgan grenfell  company in  morgan began talks with charles m schwab president of carnegie co and businessman andrew carnegie in  the goal was to buy out carnegies steel business and merge it with several other steel coal mining and shipping firms after financing the creation of the federal steel company he finally merged it in  with the carnegie steel company and several other steel and iron businesses including consolidated steel and wire company owned by william edenborn to form the united states steel corporation in  us steel was the first billiondollar company in the world having an authorized capitalization of  billion which was much larger than any other industrial firm and comparable in size to the largest railroads us steel aimed to achieve greater economies of scale reduce transportation and resource costs expand product lines and improve distribution it was also planned to allow the united states to compete globally with the united kingdom and germany schwab and others claimed that us steels size would allow the company to be more aggressive and effective in pursuing distant international markets globalization us steel was regarded as a monopoly by critics as the business was attempting to dominate not only steel but also the construction of bridges ships railroad cars and rails wire nails and a host of other products with us steel morgan had captured twothirds of the steel market and schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a  percent market share however after  the business market share dropped schwab resigned from us steel in  to form bethlehem steel which became the second largest us steel producer labor policy was a contentious issue us steel was nonunion and experienced steel producers led by schwab wanted to keep it that way with the use of aggressive tactics to identify and root out prounion troublemakers the lawyers and bankers who had organized the merger—notably morgan and ceo elbert gary—were more concerned with longrange profits stability good public relations and avoiding trouble the bankers views generally prevailed and the result was a paternalistic labor policy us steel was eventually unionized in the late s panic of edit morgans role in the economy was denounced as overpowering in this political cartoon the panic of  was a financial crisis that almost crippled the american economy major new york banks were on the verge of bankruptcy and there was no mechanism to rescue them until morgan stepped in to help resolve the crisis treasury secretary george b cortelyou earmarked  million of federal money to deposit in new york banks morgan then met with the nations leading financiers in his new york mansion where he forced them to devise a plan to meet the crisis james stillman president of the national city bank also played a central role morgan organized a team of bank and trust executives which redirected money between banks secured further international lines of credit and bought up the plummeting stocks of healthy corporations a delicate political issue arose regarding the brokerage firm of moore and schley which was deeply involved in a speculative pool in the stock of the tennessee coal iron and railroad company moore and schley had pledged over  million of the tennessee coal and iron tci stock for loans among the wall street banks the banks had called the loans and the firm could not pay if moore and schley should fail a hundred more failures would follow and then all wall street might go to pieces morgan decided they had to save moore and schley tci was one of the chief competitors of us steel and it owned valuable iron and coal deposits morgan controlled us steel and he decided it had to buy the tci stock from moore and schley elbert gary head of us steel agreed but was concerned there would be antitrust implications that could cause grave trouble for us steel which was already dominant in the steel industry morgan sent gary to see president theodore roosevelt who promised legal immunity for the deal us steel thereupon paid  million for the tci stock and moore and schley was saved the announcement had an immediate effect by november   the panic was over the crisis underscored the need for a powerful oversight mechanism vowing to never let it happen again and realizing that in a future crisis there was unlikely to be another morgan in  banking and political leaders led by senator nelson aldrich devised a plan that resulted in the creation of the federal reserve system in  bankings criticsedit i like a little competition—j p morgan by art young cartoon relating to the answer morgan gave when asked whether he disliked competition at the pujo committee while conservatives in the progressive era hailed morgan for his civic responsibility his strengthening of the national economy and his devotion to the arts and religion the left wing viewed him as one of the central figures in the system it rejected morgan redefined conservatism in terms of financial prowess coupled with strong commitments to religion and high culture enemies of banking attacked morgan for the terms of his loan of gold to the federal government in the  crisis and together with writer upton sinclair they attacked him for the financial resolution of the panic of  they also attempted to attribute to him the financial ills of the new york new haven and hartford railroad in december  morgan testified before the pujo committee a subcommittee of the house banking and currency committee the committee ultimately concluded that a small number of financial leaders was exercising considerable control over many industries the partners of jp morgan  co and directors of first national and national city bank controlled aggregate resources of  billion which louis brandeis later a us supreme court justice compared to the value of all the property in the twentytwo states west of the mississippi river unsuccessful venturesedit morgan did not always invest well as several failures demonstrated teslaedit in  the inventor nikola tesla convinced morgan he could build a transatlantic wireless communication system eventually sited at wardenclyffe that would outperform the short range radio wave based wireless telegraph system then being demonstrated by guglielmo marconi morgan agreed to give tesla  equivalent to  in  to build the

twothirds of the steel market and schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a  percent market share however after  the business market share dropped schwab resigned from us steel in  to

yourself to me  i want you  i dont speak you  you never lied  say the words  the sweetest sound  drown  fed up on you  shes gone  dancing in the dark  let me keep you  the sophomore album from morgan james s hunter features the broadway vocalists mix of retrorb and sinfluenced singersongwriter soul ostensibly james debut album hunter actually follows up her  nina simone tribute concert recording morgan james live from dizzys club cocacola that said hunter is james first recording of alloriginal material and in that sense a much more personal statement than her live debut produced by jazz and bluegrass guitarist doug wamble hunter finds james delving deeply into a collection of tunes that while not show tunes in any sense still make clever use of her stagehoned chops it also doesnt hurt that wamble an experienced musician with a wealth of musical skill and crossgenre knowledge has assembled a backing band that features a bevy of heavyweight jazz artists including acclaimed pianist robert glasper saxophonist ron blake trumpeter ravi best and others however rather than having james focus on jazz standards or even jazzinfluenced pop songs wamble helped the vocalist craft an rbinflected album that brings to mind classic artists like carole king and hall oates as well as more contemporary singers including beyoncé and the late amy winehouse james who made her broadway debut in  alongside nathan lane in the addams family has a big resonant voice with a ton of flexibility perfectly suited for such crisp soulful cuts as heart shake and bring yourself to me elsewhere she delves into several equally compelling bluesy midtempo numbers including you never lied and drown ultimately its that voice  matched with wambles superb musical vision  that creates the soulful exuberant vibe of hunter hunter was also released with three bonus tracks  matt collar rovi read more adele paloma faith jessica hernandez  the deltas beyonce knowles emeli sande format cd release

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
