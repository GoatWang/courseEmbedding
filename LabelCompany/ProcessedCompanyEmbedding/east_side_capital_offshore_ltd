servergate covered up by fbi directors offshore hedge funds feed payola to hillary and run the fbi contributing writers  opinion  americans for innovation   apr   updated apr    pdf fig  – james b comey fbi director since  when he replaced year director robert s mueller mueller was chief counsel for londonbased bank hsbc exposed in  for sheltering  billion in client funds in murky offshore tax havens populated by drug dealers money launderers and arms traffickers comey also served as chief counsel for bridgewater associates the largest hedge fund in the world in  comeys bridgewater salary was  just before taking over the helm at the fbi in his first year at the fbi he received another  million in bridgewater severance cash outs others might call it payola from his cartel buds a year later his net worth jumped up to  million comey is either the best lawyer ever or he keeps secrets from the american people with such exclusive cartel relationships nurtured by hillary and bill it is highly doubtful comey will actually move against hillary clinton for abusing national security on her personal server photo huffpost apr  —the fbi and justice department have stubbornly refused to prosecute heinous criminal acts of the obama administration they include benghazi fast and furious gun running hillary’s private server  bank bailout social networking patent theft illegal nsa snooping energy company subsidies irs targeting of conservatives bureau of land management blm confiscations baby parts trafficking libor rigging open borders overstayed visas of more than one million people religious persecution and so on now we know why the current and former fbi directors are members of a dangerous cartel whose agenda is a selfstyled new world order for new readers the “cartel” is a group of about  known bankers lawyers politicians bureaucrats technologists and judges both republicans and democrats who are deeply invested in one another through relationships stocks and mutual funds this group is currently attempting to seize control of global information data flow their agenda is defined by a new world order doctrine see below a light was shined on the fbi director when it was discovered that former fbi director robert s mueller iii   recommended obama’s supreme court recent nominee merrick b garland to be circuit judge for the district of columbia in  new world order proponents like hedge fund billionaire george soros and former hillary clinton political adviser annemarie slaughter call it a new world order the rest of us call it plain old greed and lust for power in new clothes we are approaching a point of no return a digital world controlled by spies  powermongers the quantum difference from past attempts by powerbrokers to rewrite history is the ubiquity of the digital world in our new digital world information is more valuable than gold since about  unscrupulous people in banking technology politics intelligence and law compared notes and began joining forces to embed their power permanently while lining their pockets the afi research below concludes fbi directors since  have been tied at the hip to a cartel that promotes a new world order the current fbi director james b comey current and former director robert s mueller  have numerous financial holdings and relationships that tie them unmistakably to this group the net worth of fbi directors since  have skyrocketed during the great recession comey’s from  in  to up to  million in   million increase per year mueller’s from  million in  to  million in   increase per year fbi directors since  have enjoyed exclusive hedge fund holdings not open to average americans comey was paid a  salary in  by bridgewater associates the world’s largest hedge fund then another  when he left bridgewater to become fbi director comey was general counsel for london bank hsbc which was caught sheltering  billion in dubious client funds in murky offshore accounts mueller held two exclusive hedge fund investments run by bank of new york with at least  of the funds assets run out of the cayman islands one fund defenders multistrategy hedge fund llc one of four names the fund had was closely associated with ponzi schemers including bernie madoff mueller’s fund was fined  million by the sec for funneling clients to bernie madoff commercial powermongers fbi directors since  are tied intimately with the ibm eclipse foundation and the theft of leader technologies’ social networking invention the now familiar cast of characters are ibm microsoft goldman sachs bank of america jpmorgan ge morgan stanley qualcomm hp vanguard fidelity cisco wind river eurotech spa xerox oracle sap wells fargo intel hsbc lockheed martin etc current fbi director comey who was general counsel at lockheed martin is and has been active ibm eclipse member therefore comey and lockheed were complicit in the theft of social networking perhaps the most important invention since the light bulb in  comey held up to  stock in bhp billiton ltd adr an australian ore producer including uranium on jun   bill clinton was paid  by bhp billiton for a speech in new york just coincidence on sep   bill clinton brokered a urasia uranium mining deal in kazakhstan that netted the clinton foundation  million in “donations” and  million in goldman sachs fees the broker of that uranium deal clinton and comey interests are inseparable comey clinton and fbi interests could not be more tightly aligned the fbi directors and justice department senior attorneys general have been protecting obama’s the clintons’ and the cartel’s objectives for going on two decades this protection extends to other members of the clinton bush and obama administrations the former attorney general eric h holder jr was an evident cartel plant he did not prosecute any of this criminality holder bought the judges in leader v facebook and aided the theft of social networking from leader technologies because the cartel wanted to use it to consolidate their power and control the current attorney general loretta lynch is also a cartel patsy she will follow orders dutifully so the question of whether hillary will get out of her email server problem is up to comey who will pass it to lynch who will likely find a way to punt this gaggle of attorneys has taken the art of misdirection to new heights hillary is comey’s “godmother” judging from james b comey’s investments and relationships the zebra will not change its stripes as a result comey and loretta lynch will very likely fabricate a way to protect hillary in a tangle of interlocking and indecipherable legal machinations after all hillary and bill are mueller’s and comey’s godparents as this post went to press the state department suspended its review of hillarys possession of top secret emails on her private server citing the fbi investigation as the reason we are suspicious of misdirection with this suspended review the state department has created the opportunity for the fbi to kick the can back to the state department hypothetically to complete their investigations before making a recommendation for or against indictment it will all sound very reasonable remember these people are all attorneys skilled in deception latest name for corruption “publicprivate partnerships” the latest smokescreen for this new world order agenda is “publicprivate partnerships” when you hear that grab your wallet and your privacy george soros annemarie slaughter the patron saint of “publicprivate partnerships” in the obama administration is annemarie slaughter slaughter served as a hillary clinton senior political adviser at the state department  slaughter published a new world order and is related to her new world order mentor george soros by marriage  much of what we know about slaughters relationship to hillary comes from judicial watch’s foia releases from hillary clinton’s private email server slaughter famously encouraged obama and clinton to “harness private incentives to public goals” to some this sounds like german fascism where adolf hitler did not nationalize industries that supported his policies on the other hand jewish businesses and property were confiscated in other words obama and clinton have used the power of their office to reward those who agree with them and punish those who don’t this partisan policy has forsaken the american republic instead of the process of compromise our republic is suffering a wave of scandals including the bank bailout energy company subsidies obamacare irs tea party targeting blm land rights confiscations trafficking in baby body parts libor fixing america invents act fast and furious common core massive open online course mooc open borders islamic pandering allowinglosing more than one million visa violators and attacks on religious values why has the fbi failed to prosecute these evident crimes fbi operations are shrouded in secrecy uncovering illegal conduct within the fbi is a minefield where outoftheoffice discussion of top secret information generally lands you in prison and the victim of smear campaigns by the powers that be an fbi run by honorable people keeping secrets is a good thing however an fbi run by moneygrubbing powergrabbing opportunists in the name of national security threatens the american republic itself follow the money one of the few times the public gets a glimpse into the personal affairs of the fbi director is in their senate confirmation hearing and their required annual financial disclosure the rest of the time these people just refuse to answer questions or stonewall with a smile and condescending “trust us” words or with belligerence hillary what difference does it make judge merrick b garland’s nomination raised suspicion about the fbi’s impartiality judge merrick b garland chief judge dc circuit court of appeals current merricks holdings increase from  up to  between  most of this wealth increase occurred while mueller directed the fbirobert s mueller iii judge garland’s  senate confirmation document included a letter of recommendation from robert s mueller then assistant attorney general later fbi director  investigation into mueller’s  and  financial disclosures revealed an astounding increase in net worth from  to  million cleverly buried in  entries were two hedge funds invested in almost  billion in hedge fund assets with at least  of them offshore in the cayman islands mueller hedge “funds of funds” hide many sins mueller held defenders multistrategy hedge fund llc and mellon optima ls strategy fund llc these “funds of funds” invest in other hedge funds with innocuous names like “pershing square” and glenview institutional partners” but as hsbc whistleblower hervé falciani revealed in  many are secret havens for money laundering arms trafficking and tax evasion mueller’s exclusive funds were not open to the general public the minimum investment in several of the funds of funds is —message great unwashed americans do not qualify but well make an exception for fbi director mueller mueller was evidently allowed into these funds by the cartel to buy influence at the fbi see previous post for more on this investigation both mueller hedge funds were managed by mellon bank of new york bny ground zero for washingtons poisoned well no less than ten  bny directors were shared between mueller’s defenders and mellon optima funds ask rodney he is secretly driving your economic life what you didnt get the memo fig —rodney s yanker bank of new york bny is an outside director for bank of new york bny hedge funds owned by fbi director robert s mueller no official photos are available this photo was discovered on a reunion blog for his tulane fraternity photo btp tulane laughably these people were mostly designated “outside directors” according to ethics laws an outside director must have an “arm’s length” relationship to the company one cannot be an outside director and be employed by the company also this is a bad joke a charade clearly these people care nothing about real ethics they only make their actions look ethical to an unsuspecting outsider attorneys are especially adept at such deceptions american regulators are obviously turning a blind eye for their friends the system of accountability is broken these hedge fund disclosures are a charade of transparency are these people ground zero for the corruption that has poisoned the well in washington dc inquiring minds wonder few photos of these people are available in fact only two anderson steven m bowen robert dwyer robert j grosswirth lisa hunter carla diane merrill newton p s mossman david k murphy joseph f williams iii arthur t yanker rodney s mueller’s defenders fund had

benefited from ponzi schemers the incorporator of mueller’s defenders fund was william p sauer he had been sued two months earlier by the us securities  exchange commission for running two ponzi schemes for which he eventually paid  million to settle then the fourth name for mueller’s holding ivy asset management fed clients to ponzi schemer bernie madoff and eventually paid  million to settle those complaints tellingly the fbi never prosecuted any of these bny ponzi schemers associated with muellers defenders hedge fund mueller’s replacement james b comey carries on the fbi hedge fund tradition counting his clerk job during university of chicago law school in  comey has held  jobs before becoming fbi director he changed jobs every two years most employers would consider such job hopping a sign of instability but in government legal circles that makes you qualified to be fbi director it appears that he was being groomed see bibliography below for a complete timeline of

top law enforcement job lockheed patent theft comey was general counsel to lockheed martin  this might not be notable except for the fact that lockheed martin was and is an active member of ibm’s eclipse foundation ibm eclipse has and is exploiting the social networking invention of columbus innovator leader technologies as lockheed general counsel comey was either asleep at the general counsel wheel or he participated in the theft of leader’s important invention in short comey aided and abetted the great financial crime in the history of the world lockheed prosecutions for leader technologies’ social networking patent property theft have not occurred bridgewater paid comey  million in  comey’s financial disclosure for  declared  that is  per month is any former us attorney worth such pay what were they paying for the likely answer is influence with the future fbi director comey’s bridgewater pay works out to  per hour for a  week year  by comparison  per hour is generally considered the highest attorney fee rates for salaried inside attorneys are generally half that or less comey also disclosed direct holdings not counting portfolio holdings in his many mutual funds in ibm eclipse foundation members verizon intel emerson electric microsoft qualcomm att apple hp morgan stanley lockheed martin jpmorgan wells fargo these holdings are more proof that

focus we are an opinion blog that advocates for strong intellectual property rights we welcome commenters and contributors the leader v facebook patent infringement case first came to our attention after learning that the trial judge leonard p stark us district court of delaware ignored his jury’s admission that they had no evidence to support their onsale bar verdict but the judge supported it anyway the judicial misconduct has deteriorated from there replete with two of the three judges on the federal circuit appeal panel judges alan d lourie and kimberly a moore holding facebook stock that they did not disclose to the litigants and later tried to excuse through a quick motion slipped in at the last minute by the clerk of court jan horbaly and his close friends at the federal circuit bar association the dc bar subsequently revealed that mr horbaly is not licensed to practice law in washington dc the judges ignored shocking new evidence that mark zuckerberg withheld  hard drives of  evidence from leader technologies that could prove actual theft and therefore claims even more serious than infringement in addition facebooks appeal attorney thomas g hungar of gibson dunn llp has close personal ties to just about every judicial player in this story the misconduct appears to reach into the us patent office through abuse of the reexamination process by facebook we will

f supp d  ddel  judge stark heard his jury foreman admit that the jury made the onsale bar decision without any evidence other than speculation and yet he supported that verdict anyway just months before trial judge stark allowed facebook to add the onsale bar claim after the close of all fact discovery and blocked leader from preparing its defenses to this new claim judge stark allowed the claims despite leaders prophetic argument that the action would confuse the jury and prejudice leader he also permitted the jury to ignore the pfaff v wells electronics inc test for onsale bar even after instructing the jury to use it see that jury instruction no  here he also contradicted his own instruction to leader to answer interrogatory no  in the present tense  then permitted the jury to interpret it as a  admission as well facebooks entire onsale bar case is based upon this interrogatory editorial hardly sufficient to meet the heavy burden of the clear and convincing evidence

member of the threejudge panel in leader techs v facebook inc  fd  fed cir  judge wallach is not a patent attorney this begs the question as to why a judge with no knowledge of patent law was assigned

judicial disclosures that judge wallach holds stock in facebook although when he was asked on a motion to disclose potential facebook holdings and other conflicts of interest he refused along with the other judges see motion to disclose conflicts of interest judge wallach continued in silence even after clerk of court horbaly failed to provide him with dr lakshmi arunachalam’s motions according to his federal circuit staffer valeri white and yet the clerk signed an order regarding that motion on judge wallach’s behalf see a full analysis of these events at donna kline now judge wallach also failed to police his court’s violation of leader’s fifth and th amendment constitutional right to due process when he participated in the fabrication of new arguments and evidence for facebook in the secrecy of judges chambers after he had just invalidated facebook’s sole remaining item of evidence using disbelieved testimony as ostensible evidence of an opposite judge wallach also failed to police his court when he failed to apply the supreme courts pfaff v wells electronics inc test for onsale bar evidence which included even the federal circuit’s own group one v hallmark cards inc
