jon duke     tweet when i started looking for internships i wanted to find something at a startup that would allow me to use my technical background in chemistry and engineering  i was ecstatic when i was given the opportunity to work at cerahelix through the maine venture fund mvf summer internship and knew this opportunity would provide me with the wealth of experiences i was hoping to get from my summer position my responsibilities as a summer intern are split between the mvf and two of the fund’s portfolio companies including cerahelix  cerahelix is building a ceramic membrane that performs molecular filtration for produced water and other applications under extreme conditions my prior education as a phd chemist and experience as an rd engineer have helped me come up to speed quickly on the technology behind the product being developed allowing me to dive into the business development and marketing opportunities they would like me to address at cerahelix i am helping the company prioritize their market opportunities and am performing a competitive and cost analysis on those key markets  it has been a great experience to translate the business theory of the classroom that i learned during my first year at tuck into tangible solutions that have a meaningful impact on the success of a startup company it is a unique professional and educational experience to interact with the team of a startup company and i doubt that i could have found such meaningful experiences like i am getting at cerahelix in another internship     brandon is currently an mba student at tuck school of business at dartmouth and holds a phd in chemistry from dartmouth college and a ba from willamette university   « back to more news posts by date posts by date select month june  march
