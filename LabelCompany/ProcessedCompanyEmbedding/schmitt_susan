formagnifying glassdid you knowhow to find the right vet or clinic for your animalchoosing the right vet for your pet can be tough after all your furry friend cant tell you how he or she feels about the doctor even though youre not the one treated by the vet whoever your animal sees is obviously your decision since many veterinary diseases and injuries can turn into emergencies very quickly its important to have a goto vet this way you can ensure youll know whom to see when your animal needs carespeak to your friends and family about vets whove treated their pets you can even talk to your groomer or an animal shelter worker for referrals when you visit the clinics youve been referred to check that the facility is clean animals are separated and the staff is calm and courteous not all clinics are american animal hospital association accredited this accreditation isnt a legal necessity though a clinic thats aahaaccredited is guaranteed to offer highquality medical care to receive accreditation the clinic has to meet the aahas standards in the areas of facility equipment and quality careif youre looking for a specialist you want to make sure he or she is boardcertified to practice in that specific area of animal medicine youll want to make sure your vet is also convenient to visit so there are factors to take into accountlook for a vet whos close to your house as many animals dont like being in the car for a long time if theres an emergency you want to make sure you can get your pet to the vet as quickly as possible though all veterinary clinics must be able to make arrangements to see their clients pets outside of office hours if theres an emergency these arrangements may not always be at the facility youre used to double check with the office to see where the emergency facility issome clinics have longer hours than others if you work a  schedule make sure the office is open on nights and weekendswhether you have pet health insurance or not its still worth checking what the regular costs for typical procedures are at the vets office there isnt a set standard when it comes to price so its good to know that youre not looking into a clinic thats beyond your meansthe type of animal you own should play a part in which vet you choose as well while your options are vast if you have a dog or cat you may have to visit an avian clinic for your bird or an exotics clinic for your snaketypes of vetsjust as there are many types of doctors there are many types of vets some focus on livestock or house pets while others may specialize in dentistry or surgery they may work in a veterinary clinic or zoo working specifically with the animals housed there or travel to farms to work with livestock since horse racing and other equestrian activities are so popular some vets are trained to work just with horsesdiseases like malaria and yellow fever are also transmitted through animals some vets have insight to diseases that affect both humans and animals vets have contributed to the treatment and cure of many diseases that plagued both humans and their furry friendsgovernment agencies employ veterinarians as well when an animal comes from a foreign land these vets quarantine them and check for any diseases that may be present in an effort to control new diseases that can be brought into the country other specific types of vets includeprivate practice veterinarians this is the most popular type of veterinarian and many of these professionals work at clinics they may also go to farms to care for livestock that cant be transported to the clinicteaching and research these vets work at veterinary schools training students who are planning on joining the veterinary field they may also work in college labs conducting research pertaining to animal healthregulatory medicine these vets work closely with diseases rather than animals themselves their responsibilities include controlling or eliminating illnesses and protecting the public from diseases in animals they may also work with the us department of agricultures food safety and inspection servicespublic health these vets are also known as epidemiologists they work for cities counties states or federal agencies to help control and prevent animal and human disease public health vets may work for the fda to determine the safety of medicines and food additivesuniformed services the us army veterinary corps employ these vets theyre responsible for biomedical research and developmentprivate industry these vets go to school solely for positions in pharmaceutical and biomedical research they work in labs that produce chemicals drugs and vaccines for both humans and animalswhat do veterinary assistants doa vet assistant works alongside the veterinarian and helps out around the clinic in some cases they may assist vets in surgery or restrain struggling animals during tests or lab work the everyday duties of a veterinary assistant include monitoring and caring for animals after surgery keeping medical records cleaning animals teeth feeding and bathing them cleaning cages sterilizing surgical equipment giving animals medication collecting samples for testing and performing laboratory tests and offering grief counseling to pet ownerswhat to expect at the vets officeits a good idea to bring your pet to the vet regularly this way he or she becomes familiar and comfortable with the care providers and you can stay on top of your pets preventative care if the animal is small enough bring it to the office in a carrier just as you visit the doctor for a yearly check up you should bring in your pet for regular check ups as well during a routine veterinary visit the vet will probably begin by asking you if there have been any changes in your pets behavior or habits the vet will then take your pets vitals like weight temperature pulse and respiration rate and perform a physical examination of the pet during a physical exam the vet checks the abdomen for swollen organs and the legs feet and joints for any potential problems depending on the age breed or condition of your pet your veterinarian may also check the eyes ears and mouthwhen your vet conducts a full body examination he or she will check out your pets coat and skin noting any hair loss itchy spots or lumps keep note of your animals shedding habits so you can let the vet know if anything seems abnormal the vet will check for parasites fleas ticks mites and heartworms as well  vaccinations are also important to your pet especially if you have a cat or a dog and your vet will suggest that you make sure theyre current keeping up to date with vaccinations can prevent your furry friend from getting distemper rabies hepatitis and lyme disease some vaccinations last longer than others so speak to your doctor about staying caught up with your animals shots cost and insurancejust like your own health insurance you want to make sure your animal is covered before he or she needs veterinary services some common animal surgeries can cost thousands of dollars and you dont want to end up having to foot a surprise bill that costs more than your paycheck theres no set price for pet health insurance costs can depend on factors such as where you live the age and breed of your pet and how much coverage you want before you take out a pet insurance policy youll want to meet with your vet to go over what he or she thinks your animal should be covered for many vets believe that you should make sure cancer chronic disease hereditary and congenital disease and common breedrelated medical conditions are all addressed in your policysome pet owners cant afford insurance for their pet so there are other options to make paying for surprise pet visits as easy as possible some pet stores have wellness plans  which tend to be much cheaper than an insurance policy  that offer shots check ups screenings and discounts on various procedures your pet may need a lot of veterinary offices offer payment plans for pricey procedures as well as long as you have decent credit history for a lastditch option there are even privately funded organizations that offer pet owners financial aid for their pets treatments  we just redesigned ypcom do you like it× likenot a fan× thank youfeedback
