the utility agrees to be acquired by algonquin power  utilities corp matthew dilallo tmfmd feb   at pm   what shares of empire district electric nyseede jumped more than  by  am est on wednesday sparking the rally was the announcement that the company was being acquired by canadianbased algonquin power  utilities tsxaqn so what empire district electric has agreed to be acquired in an allcash deal for  per share valuing the company at  billion that purchase price represents a  premium to the companys closing price on monday and is  above its closing price in early december which was before the company announced that its board of directors was in the early stages of exploring strategic alternatives in other words this merger agreement is outcome of that process this transaction is the second acquisition by a canadianbased utility of a usbased utility this week with fortis tsxfts agreement to buy itc holdings nyseitc for  billion in cashandstock the other deal driving these cross boarder acquisitions is the fact that us utilities are allowed by regulators to earn larger profits than canadian utilities can earn for example itc holdings is allowed by ferc to earn a return on equity of  which is much higher than the  that fortis is allowed to earn further canadian buyers have cheaper access to financing enabling them to pay more than us companies can pay that suggests that there wont likely to be any competing bids emerging to trump the agreed upon transactions now what this transaction will require a pretty lengthy regulatory process and empire district electric doesnt expect the deal to close until the first quarter of  not only do state commissions need to approve the deal but because it is a crossborder deal federal regulators need to approve it as well that lengthy and complex approval process adds to the risk that the deal might fall through which is why existing shareholders are better off cashing in now since this is an allcash deal even if they are
