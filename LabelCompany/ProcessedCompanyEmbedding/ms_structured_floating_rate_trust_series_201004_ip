how sukuk works introduction structuring and application of sukuk bonds  islamic finance resource islamic finance resource skip to content homebooklist glossary introduction to islamic finance shariah scholars ← mufti taqi usmani presents paper at world economic forum annual meeting  the role of sukuk after recent defaults → how sukuk works introduction structuring and application of sukuk bonds posted on april     comments how sukuk works introduction structuring and application of sukuk bonds an excellent introduction to sukuk bonds from wwwfinanceinislamcom author shariq nisar islamic bonds sukuk its introduction and application what is sukuk sukuk in general may be understood as a shariah compliant ‘bond’ in its simplest form sukuk represents ownership of an asset or its usufruct the claim embodied in sukuk is not simply a claim to cash flow but an ownership claim this also differentiates sukuk from conventional bonds as the latter proceed over interest bearing securities whereas sukuk are basically investment certificates consisting of ownership claims in a pool of assets sukuk plural of word sak were extensively used by muslims in the middle ages as papers representing financial obligations originating from trade and other commercial activities however the present structure of sukuk are different from the sukuk originally used and are akin to the conventional concept of securitization a process in which ownership of the underlying assets is transferred to a large number of investors through certificates representing proportionate value of the relevant assets sukuk vs conventional bonds a bond is a contractual debt obligation whereby the issuer is contractually obliged to pay to bondholders on certain specified dates interest and principal whereas the sukuk holders claims an undivided beneficial ownership in the underlying assets consequently sukuk holders are entitled to share in the revenues generated by the sukuk assets as well as being entitled to share in the proceeds of the realization of the sukuk assets a distinguishing feature of a sukuk is that in instances where the certificate represents a debt to the holder the certificate will not be tradable on the secondary market and instead is held until maturity or sold at par accounting and auditing organisation for islamic financial institutions aaoifi defines sukuk as being “certificates of equal value representing after closing subscription receipt of the value of the certificates and putting it to use as planned common title to shares and rights in tangible assets usufructs and services or equity of a given project or equity of a special investment activity” benefits and features tradable shariahcompliant capital market product providing medium to longterm fixed or variable rates of return assessed and rated by international rating agencies which investors use as a guideline to assess riskreturn parameters of a sukuk issue regular periodic income streams during the investment period with easy and efficient settlement and a possibility of capital appreciation of the sukuk liquid instruments tradable in secondary market uses of sukuk funds the most common uses of sukuk can be named as project specific assetspecific and balance sheet specific  projectspecific sukuk under this category money is raised through sukuk for specific project for example qatar global sukuk issued by the government of qatar in  to mobilize resources for the construction of hamad medical city hmc in doha in this case a joint venture special purpose vehicle spv the qatar global sukuk qsc was incorporated in qatar with limited liability this spv acquired the ownership of land parcel that was registered in the name of hmc the land parcel was placed in trust and ijarabased trust certificates tcs were issued worth us million due by october  the annual floating rate of return was agreed at libor plus  per cent  assetsspecific sukuk under this arrangement the resources are mobilise by selling the beneficiary right of the assets to the investors for example the government of malaysia raised us  million through ijara sukuk trust certificates tcs in  under this arrangement the beneficiary right of the land parcels has been sold by the government of malaysia to an spv which was then resold to investors for five years the spv kept the beneficiary rights of the properties in trust and issued floating rate sukuk to investors another example of assetspecific sukuk is us million fiveyear ijara sukuk issued to fund the extension of the airport in bahrain in this case the underlying asset was the airport land sold to an spv  balance sheetspecific sukuk an example of the balance sheet specific use of sukuk funds is the islamic

capital market by issuing us  million fiveyear sukuk due for maturity in    types of sukuk sukuk can be of many types depending upon the type of islamic modes of financing and trades used in its

selling the deeds in the securities market at his discretion  the sale of ms must follow the rules listed below if the mudarba capital before the operations of the project is still in the form of money the trading of ms would be like exchange of money for money in that case the rules of bay alsarf would be applied if muqarda capital is in the form of debt then it must satisfy the principles of debt trading in islam if capital is in the form of combination of cash receivables goods real assets and benefits trade must be based on market price evolved by mutual consent the managerspv who receives the fund collected from the subscribers to ms can also invest his own fund he will get profit for his capital contribution in addition to his share in the profit as mudarib neither prospectus nor ms should contain a guarantee from the issuer or the manager for the fund for the capital or a fixed profit or a profit based on any percentage of the capital accordingly the prospectus or the ms issued pursuant to it may not stipulate payment of a specific amount to the ms holder the profit is to be divided as determined by applying rules of shariah that is an amount access of the capital and not the revenue or the yield and profit and loss account of the project must be published and disseminated to ms holders it is permissible to create reserves for contingencies such as loss of capital by deducting from the profit the prospectus can also contain a promise made by a third party totally unrelated to the parties to the contract in terms of legal entity or financial status to donate a

future date spv can also appoint an agent to market the promised quantity at the time of delivery perhaps at a higher price the difference between the purchase price and the sale price is the profit

payable quarterly with the sukuk having an overall tenor of  years and an option for early redemption the proceeds of the issue cash will be used by the issuer to finance the reclamation of the land and the development of base infrastructure through multiple project finance istisna agreements as the works carried out under each istisna are completed by the contractor and delivered to the issuer the issuer will give notice to the project company under the master ijara agreement and will lease such base infrastructure on the basis of a lease to own transaction  hybrid sukuk considering the fact that sukuk issuance and trading are important means of investment and taking into account the various demands of investors a more diversified sukuk – hybrid or mixed asset sukuk – emerged in the market in a hybrid sukuk the underlying pool of assets can comprise of istisna murabaha receivables as well as ijara having a portfolio of assets comprising of different classes allows for a greater mobilization of funds however as murabaha and istisna contracts cannot be traded on secondary markets as securitised instruments at least  percent of the pool in a hybrid sukuk must comprise of sukuk tradable in the market such as an ijara sukuk due to the fact the murabaha and istisna receivables are part of the pool the return on these certificates can only be a predetermined fixed rate of return steps involved in the structure islamic finance originator transfers tangible assets as well as murabaha deals to the spv spv issues certificates of participation to the sukuk holders and receive funds the funds are used by the islamic finance originator islamic finance originator purchase these assets from the spv over an agreed period of time investors receive fixed payment of return on the assets hybrid sukuk in practice islamic development bank issued the first hybrid sukuk of assets comprising  sukuk alijara  of murabaha receivables and  sukuk alistisna this issuance required the idb’s guarantee in order to secure a rating and international marketability the   million islamic sukuk was issued by solidarity trust services limited stsl a special purpose company incorporated in jersey channel islands the islamic corporation for the development of private sector icd played an intermediary role by purchasing the asset from idb and selling it to the solidarity trust services limited stsl at the consolidated net asset value conclusion the market for sukuk is now maturing and there is an increasing momentum in the wake of interest from issuers and investors sukuk have confirmed their viability as an alternative means to mobilise medium to longterm savings and investments from a huge investor base different sukuk structures have been emerging over the years but most of the sukuk issuance to date have been ijara sukuk since they are based on the undivided prorata ownership of the underlying leased asset it is freely tradable at par premium or discount tradability of the sukuk in the secondary market makes them more attractive although less common than ijara sukuk other types of sukuk are also playing significant role in emerging markets to help issuers and investors alike to participate in major projects including airports bridges power plants etc the sovereign sukuk issues following malaysia’s lead are enjoying widespread and positive acclaim among
