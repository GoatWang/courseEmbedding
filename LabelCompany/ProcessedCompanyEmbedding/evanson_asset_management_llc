within a few seconds evanson asset management® specializing in index and passive managementlow cost fixed annual retainer fees back to home page client section email password updated november  tax efficiency and passive and index investing abstract  passive and index portfolios reduce the pass through of capital gains through very low turnover rates of securities within portfolios  they can also reduce taxes on dividends through selection of lower yielding dividend paying equities in a given asset class  within passive and index portfolios low turnover rates also mean transaction costs and other expenses are reduced for investors  over long time frames these reductions increase after tax returns to passive investors significantly  annual pass through of capital gains in dfa equity funds typically runs  to  per year and dfa offers several tax managed and tax advantaged funds which reduce pass throughs even further passive and index investment strategies produce lower capital gains and dividend pass throughs in taxable accounts when compared with active funds  active managers frequently trade stocks or bonds and turn over securities in portfolios far more rapidly than passive and index managers  consequently investors in actively managed funds or portfolios are likely to realize higher capital gains taxes than passive and index investorsthough there is wide variation the average actively managed portfolio has a turnover rate of roughly  per year while it is around  for passive and index portfolios there is substantial yearly variation in capital gains depending upon market returns  for many asset classes and many years dfas passthrough of capital gains has run around  to  of the net asset value nav for most of its funds  dfa also offers many funds which tax managed internally to reduce capital gains and dividend taxes several studies have examined the deleterious effect of high turnover rates on aftertax portfolio returns  their effect is substantial  a stanford study compared median pretax and aftertax performance for  actively managed stock mutual funds over a  year period from  through a high tax bracket investor received less than half of the pretax performance  and a medium taxbracket investor  due to tax pass throughsfurther assuming investors cashed out at the end of  years they would pay further capital gains upon liquidation and capture only  and  of the pretax return respectively due to passthroughs  over even short time frames the effects of high turnover and capital gains taxes on returns is still substantialmorningstar looked at returns for actively managed us equity funds for  through investors with the highest federal capital gains tax rates received on average a little over  of the total returns they would have received had their money been invested in a taxdeferred account  wall street and mutual funds report performance figures before taxes and liquidationin fact mutual fund managers are frequently hired or fired by firms and clients naively comparing their absolute performance with other managers while tax consequences and real aftertax returns are ignored  a study by david booth of dfa compared the aftertax performance of two stellar active funds janus and fidelity magellan for a  year period ending in   both funds outperformed the s  p by  annually but after taxes trailed it by   taxefficiency matters and passive and index portfolios maximize it another study published in  looked at the pretax and aftertax performance of  funds classified by morningstar as large growth or growth and incometheir analysis included funds in existence for the  year period from  through  and included the vanguard s  p  indexon a pretax basis the vanguard index outperformed  of the actively managed fundson an aftertax basis it outperformed  of the active funds  when mutual fund expenses were added in only  of the  funds  outperformed the sp  after taxes  investors with equity assets in taxable accounts will benefit significantly from using passive and index portfolios as opposed to actively managed and traded portfolios  capital gains tax pass throughs and taxefficiency will vary from year to year in both active and passive portfolios since returns will vary dfa offers five taxmanaged passive equity funds in discrete asset classes one asset class per fund as well as corevector funds holding multiple asset classes  corevector portfolios reduce turnover even further since they allow asset classes to drift within one fund rather than forcing sales when an equity drifts out of its asset class as is the case for discrete funds  in addition dfa offers taxmanaged versions of two corevector funds  in  the majority of dfas equity funds passed through no capital gains taxes because there were few gains to be had  dfas taxadvantaged and taxmanaged funds reduce dividend pass throughs by about a third by weeding out high dividend payers in a given asset class  aside from using taxmanaged funds investors can employ other strategies to minimize taxes in taxable accountsfixed income allocations can be filled in laddered portfolios of municipal bonds purchased at par or premium which are then held until maturityno taxes will be due unless bonds were purchased at a substantial discountequity asset classes with potentially high capital gains or dividend income can be placed in various taxdeferred accounts some advisory firms promote taxloss harvesting  we examine tax loss harvesting elsewhere on our website in tax loss harvesting  we do not promote the practice but will tax loss harvest whenever a client wishes to do so  tax loss harvesting involves buying or selling funds to realize losses then using those loses to offset passthrough gains in funds which have produced them or gains from funds which have been sold  tax loss harvesting increases transaction costs and may reduce as well as augment after tax returns taxmanagement strategies in active or passive portfolios rely primarily upon controlling the realization of capital gains and minimizing the pass through of dividends  retrospective statistical data promoting the advantage of taxmanaged funds generally assumes higher levels of capital gains and dividends which occurred in the past and may not occur as strongly in the future  historical data indicates that for very long time frames the majority of returns in equities came from dividends and not from capital gains  should capital gains diminish or disappear in a protracted bear market the advantage of tax management would be diminished  there is evidence for this in fund data during the  through  bear market and the  financial crisis  delaying capital gains for ten or twenty years may mean that gains might be realized at a future time when capital gains are higher than today  capital gains taxes are low in  and the us government has a need to fund its underfunded budget what pass through of capital gains taxes might an investor expect to pay in a welldiversified passive and index portfolio with tax efficient equity fundscapital gains will vary year to yearassuming that the few equity asset classes with high tax passthroughs of capital gains can be held in taxqualified retirement accounts or a noload annuity a rough estimate might be that about  in capital gains might be passed through by tax efficient dfa funds in the average yearthis would be taxed at  for most investors plus state capital gains taxes if applicable  thus a modest  of  would be taxed or  on  in equity value  as of  average dividend yields are historically low around  in the us and  overseas for most equity asset classes  with dividends currently taxed at the same rate as capital gains then a

retainer fees back to home page client section email password updated december  dfa  vs  vanguard vs  etfs abstract  historical data on dfa asset class funds for limited time samples show dfa is likely adding  to  above committee designed indexes in most equity asset classes  dfa creates additional returns by avoiding the costs biannual index reconstitution creates from forcing index trackers to buy or sell the same securities at the same time  it also makes use of a variety of return enhancing strategies including the use of patient buying and selling strategies dark pools instinet crosses and stock lending  etf exchange traded fund indexes are derivative securities with their own set of risks including premiums and discounts from the underlying securities and their tendency to trigger flash crashes in prices dfas approach to portfolio construction and management is fundamentally different from other firms including those employing active management strategies as well as indexes and etfs  dfa uses academic research to define asset classes and structures portfolios to capture premiums additional returns available when asset classes are tilted towards value and small cap stocks and globally diversified  it also makes use of a variety of other return enhancing strategies  every  of additional return counts  it is important to note that all passive and index strategies whether dfas indexed mutual funds or etfs have been shown to outperform active management strategies like stock picking and market timing and are almost always the better choice see active and passive investment strategy comparison elsewhere on our website dfas asset class portfolios employ statistical analysis of long term data to define and differentiate asset classes and capture their returns  while sometimes producing asset class returns similar to those from indexes the structure of dfa funds is passive and not based on committee designed indexes  indexed mutual funds and etfs based upon indexes construct portfolios consisting of stocks or fixed income securities which are reviewed and modified by committees  for example the sp  index measures the performance of large cap us growth stocks  the s  p committee meets every six months generally removes stocks which are doing poorly or fail to meet their criteria and replaces them with stocks which are considered a better fit for the index  coincidentially the replacements are often stocks with rising prices and that makes it a quasimomentum fund  in the  bear market for example the s  p removed over  of the  stocks in the index  during the techinternet crash from early  through end  the nasdaq  index removed over  stocks of the  stocks in the index  although the s  p and other indexes are generally referred to as benchmarks which active managers strive and usually fail to beat they are more like a foot long ruler that is continually relengthened to make measurements look larger  benchmarks on benches do not move around  the composition of indexes is not constant but a variable as opposed to committee designed indexes dfa structures portfolios to capture the returns in a welldefined asset class and includes every traded stock in a given asset class which passes its criteria for belonging in that asset class as defined by academic research  dfa performs various common sense screens like eliminating companies with serious legal or regulatory problems or abnormal price behavior  all securities in all portfolios are screened daily  criteria for asset class membership dont shift as a function of current opinion or committee decisions  dfa determines the criteria for asset class membership based upon extensive statistical analysis of risk premiums  risk premiums are additional returns for additional volatility and risk in a given asset class  research by fama and french and others indicates that the cost of capital for riskier ventures and thus the return to investors for providing that capital are likely to be higher for riskier assets that may be volatile in price or even fail whats usually referred to as the riskreturn trade off for equities dfa identifies two main sources of premiums in us international and emerging markets  they are the small cap premium and the value premium  historical data show that tilting towards value and small cap stocks in diversified portolios significantly increases returns over ever popular large cap growth and total stock market funds  for us markets  to  the large value premium was about  the small value premium was about  and the small cap premium was about   for developed nonus markets  to  the large value premium was about  and the small value premium was about   for emerging markets  to  the value premium was about   data is more limited for nonus markets but dimsons study triumph of the optimists covering  countries for  years shows comparable value and small cap premiums in almost all countries  its annual updates for  to  show similar results  dfa also incorporates momentum and profitability screens for all securities in its portfolios dfa  vs vanguard dfas factor analytic based asset classes typically have significantly different portfolio compositions than indexes and index etfs  during december  vanguards us large value index had a higher pricebook ratio  and higher average market cap b than dfas us large value portfolio with a  pricebook ratio and b average market cap  a higher pricebook indicates less capture of the value premium thus the dfa portfolio was more valuey  asset classes go in and out of favor  in  vanguards large cap growth fund produced better returns  versus dfas   but for the trailing  year period dfas fund returned  per year versus  per year for vanguard a  annual basis point advantage for dfa  during december  vanguards us small value index had a pricebook ratio of  and average market cap of b versus dfas with a  pricebook ratio and b average market cap  for  vanguards small cap value index lost  versus a larger loss of  for dfa but for the trailing  years dfas us smalll cap value fund returned  versus vanguards return of   through  vanguards small cap us growth index returned  versus dfas small cap return of  and dfas us microcap return of   dfa specializes in capturing value and small cap premiums seeking alpha october  matched dfa and vanguard funds by asset class for  through may  and found that dfa outperformed vanguard by    and  per year in us large cap large value small cap and small value asset classes respectively net of expense ratios  vanguard only offers one index fund overseas its total international stock fund and it returned  annually for that period versus returns between  and  annually in dfas various asset class portfolios in international developed and emerging markets  we have done similar comparisons in the past and came up with an estimate that dfa strategies add somewhere between  and  annually to globally diversified equity portfolios  this again highlights the importance of keeping advisory management fees as low as possible in dfa style portfolios  it also suggests dfas asset class portfolios are a bit more precise in capturing size and value premiums than committee designed indexes none of these comparisons are statistically robust since they are based on the very limited time frames sampled  they do suggest that dfas approach has added to returns in several equity asset classes  dfas  year trailing returns for their us large cap portfolio are near identical to vanguards and all other indexes tracking that asset class  us large cap growth is very much a plain vanilla asset class available through at least one hundred different openended and index or etf mutual funds  but that is not the case for most equity asset classes  for example through end the ten year trailing return for dfas us large value fund was  versus the russell large value index return of   dfas us small value fund returned  versus  for the comparable russell index  dfas international value fund returned  versus a return of  for the russell index  dfas emerging markets value fund returned  versus  for the russell emerging market index how dfa creates additional returns versus indexes and etfs dfas additional returns arise from four factors  the first is the factor analytic structure of their passive portfolios described above versus committee designed indexes  the second is their avoidance of the cost of index reconstitutions  index based mutual funds and etfs must promptly reconstitute portfolios every time index committees change index compositions  this means pure index funds must buy and sell when everyone else running index funds does so making for higher prices when buying and lower prices when selling  dfa has examined index reconstitution in detail and finds that in day  after a change in index composition the cost of maintaining index portfolios subtracts over  basis points for us large value over  basis points for us small caps and  basis points for us small value  a comprehensive study by sunil wahal examined all of dfas equity trades from  through  and found its ability to be a liquidity provider when others were selling or buying generated a  to  basis point advantage in trading costs for dfa in addition to being a patient buyer and seller of securities and avoiding forced index tracking a third way dfa adds value is through extensive use of alternative trading markets like instinet crossing and dark pool trading outside the conventional exchanges  dfa is a patient slow buyer and seller of securities for all portfolios at all times  a comprehensive study by sunil wahil examined all of dfas equity trades from  through  over  million trades representing about  billion and estimates dfa added  bps to  bps from reducing trading coststhe fourth way dfa creates additional returns versus indexes is from securities lending  dfa is a major securities lender  during fiscal year  dfas us securities lending added between  and  basis points to returns often proponents of index mutual funds and etfs promote their low fee structures  while vanguard and etf based indexes do have slightly lower expense ratios for comparable asset classes dfas funds are low cost and have far lower expense ratios than active funds  typically the cost difference between dfas funds and pure indexes or etfs runs  to  basis points annually  a common argument for etfs is that they dont pass through yearly capital gains to investors since their structure is that of a derivative instrument  investors dont actually own shares they own a number representing shares  this argument has some merit though is often overemphasized  etf shares are derivative securities and not the same as directly owning shares  dfas funds typically pass through  to  or less of net asset value in capital gains each year very low and theyve many taxmanaged funds which reduce taxable passthroughs even further  all dfa vanguard and etf portfolios are very taxefficient compared to actively managed portfolios potential risks with etfs etfs are derivative securities with their own special characteristics and risks  they are very different in structure from conventional openended mutual funds like those from dfa and vanguard  the purchasers of etfs own shares in pledged assets where the share price can be above or below the actual market value of the shares  purchasers of etf shares should be aware of the possibility that etfs can trade at a substantial discount to the shares backing their net asset value nav and thus dont accurately track the indexes and involve more share price volatility  in theory arbitrageurs will close the big spreads between share price and nav if shares are priced under the nav but a casual perusal of historical share price versus net asset value for etfs reveals that many have traded at a  or  discount for months or years  the financial times  notes that when market stress develops and investors need liquidity the most and wish to sell their etf shares the authorized participants in etfs who create the pledged shares are unlikely to close the gap by buying shares but will rather redeem their pledged shares to exit a losing position and leave etf shareholders with shares worth less than the disappearing security pledges the new york federal reserve bank wall streets top regulator announced in december  that extreme price movements in etfs holding stocks bonds and other assets had prompted it to take a closer look at the inner workings of etfs  nothing has been done as of late   the  etf industry had about  trillion under managment as of fall   the fed is concerned that etf share prices may not always reflect underlying asset values and that the authorized participants who create etf shares might not do so if there are heavy redemption requests etfs are not profitable for fund companies unless they hold  to  million or more in assets and thus many close when they cant raise sufficient assets  during  through  about  shut down  hundreds of etfs perform differently than the indexes they are supposed to track sometimes strikingly so wsj   their average tracking error versus the index was  in   leveraged etfs are even more problematic  as of november  all  leveraged etfs that were operating since january  had lost money according to morningstar even those where the underlying index rose and etfs are involved in speculative high frequency computer trading on wall street  this was dramatically illustrated in the socalled flash crash on may   where the dow fell almost  points in  minutes  the wall street journal reported that while the dow lost as much as  temporarily many etfs lost almost all their value some dropping to pennies a share  this is hardly the liquidity hft proponents claim  many etfs saw their net asset value fall only  to  while their share price plunged  or more triggering stop losses far below where investors purchased the etfs  nasdaq cancelled over  trades that took place more than  below the precrash price  when the damage was tallied about  of the cancelled trades during the flash crash involved etfs cbsmw   thus with indexes off around  investors who were down  to  in etfs lost significantly more than investors in conventional openended mutual funds if their stop losses were triggered  one of the sales pitches for etfs is that they allow intradday trading unlike openended mutual funds the wall street journal  carried an article entitled etfs seen moving market as tail wags the dog  sales of midcap stocks were driven by massive sales of midcap etfs producing a market where for just the fifth time in the last five years large and small cap indexes rose while midcaps declined on extraordinary volume  they surmise that large etf trades were influencing the prices of underlying securities as opposed to the other way around since securities prices are supposed to determine etf prices  this is another example of distortions introduced by etf share prices departing from the quote prices of the underlying securities they represent  for example on june th  a day where equity indexes declined substantially the financial times reported the losses for etfs today were far beyond what the most sophisticated financial risk models could have predicted for worstcase scenarios  illiquidity quickly became a problem on  the financial times reported that high levels of settlement failures on etfs have revived a debate about their structure and liquidity  settlement failures occur when banks pledge assets to etfs then fail to deliver them  the bank of international settlements the central bankers bank had warned that settlement failures on etfs pose potential systemic problems to the financial system  says one critic this is an unrealised operational risk which could morph into an actual operational risk in nanoseconds  what is the actual liquidity of a security if it takes five days to find the security to make settlement  in may  reuters reported that the countrys largest etf providers are arranging billion dollar credit lines that can be tapped to keep illiquidity from turning an etf selloff into a credit market meltdown  vanguard group guggenheim investments and first trust are among us fund companies that have lined up new or expanded bank guarantees on  and  the financial times reported that john bogle the founder of vanguard funds is calling on politicians to reexamine etfs  he complained that the annual turnover of securities in the biggest etf that tracks the sp  sometimes reach a stunning  of assets  he found that where mutual fund and etf investors are invested in the same underlying fund etf investors trailed returns in conventional open ended funds by a large  annually  he notes that the intraday market pricing in etfs encourages trading while prices in open ended funds are only set after the market close and the evidence is clear that trading decreases returns on  the financial times published an article entitled is it time to halt the rise of the etf machine  they note that on august th  more than a fifth of all us etfs were forced to stop trading when the dow jones industrial average dropped more than  points before rebounding  trading was littered with more than  halts that inhibited the essential arbitrage mechanisms of etfs and prompted their prices to fall well below the indices they were designed to track  vanguard founder john bogle has warned about etfs even though vanguard offers them emphasizing their sheer size and fragility in times of market stress  the financial stability board set up after the  financial crisis said it had seen a number of disquieting developments in etfs  the bank of england warned that the risks associated with etfs are not being made clear etf declines on august th  were again serious  the us equity markets gapped down and major indexes declined  to  from their prior closing prices  many etfs declined  to  with  etfs declining at least   etf liquidity disappeared instantly thanks to high frequency trading computers even though etfs are supposed to track the underlying securities that have been pledged and enhance liquidity  etf providers immediately blamed rules put in place by nyse rule  after the may  flash crash claiming they prevented accurate pricing of etfs  hft traders said they did not have enough information to run their algorithms backed out of the market and withdrew liquidity  the dow plunged  points to reveal the structural limitations underlying us equities  futures cash and etfs are priced and arbitraged off each other and according to the financial times hft showed  evidence of cracks in the plumbing that underpins the worlds largest equity market  despite all the warnings from financial regulators and others no changes in etf trading have been made as of late  a major marketing point promoted by the etf industry is that they can be traded and stopped out any time during market hours  but during the may  flash crash etf investors were burned at the very moment they needed liquidity the most  according to a trim tabs report etf investors are so bad at picking the right time to buy or shortsell the equity markets that those doing exactly the opposite of what etf investors did would have ended up with  profits  trim tabs theorized that etfs are mostly traded by less informed more emotional retail investors  they believe the supposed liquidity of etfs gives inexperienced investors a false sense of power  dfa funds and index based mutual funds offered by vanguard do not trade at a discount or premium to net asset value cannot be shorted and are only priced at market close  eam never recommends trading dfa funds indexes or etfs this is discussed in tactical asset allocation elsewhere on our website another major marketing point of etfs is their very low expense ratio  typically etf expense ratios run  to  basis points for fixed income and  to  basis points for equities but it varies depending upon asset classes and vendors  openended conventional mutual funds in passive and index funds from dfa and vanguard typically run about  to  basis points above etfs  however there is often a hidden additional cost to etfs that is almost never mentioned  etfs are in a sense derivatives  the shares they sell come from securities pledged to the etf by other investment companies such as mutual funds  when these companies lend the stock to etfs there is some operational cost incurred for the share lender and that is ultimately passed on to the investor though we have been unable to determine what it is  a financial times article  reported that us pension funds have sued blackrock for looting securities lending revenues through creating an affiliate which profits from lending to blackrocks uslisted ishares etfs also engage in share lending  etfr october  the monthly publication of index universe reported that lending from etfs is a practice shrouded in mystery and that obfuscation is the norm  in any traded security obfuscation is not in the investors interest  etfr notes that etfs lend securities and collect money from that lending  the borrower of the shares gives the etf some form of collateral equal to the value of the loaned shares  the etf company can then use that collateral usually treasuries or cash equivalents to invest elsewhere  some of the profits from the invested collateral go to etf shareholders and some to the etf company but it is highly variable  they quote a leading securities law expert they dont want to talk about it because they dont want to disclose the extent to which they keep the proceeds  etfr notes however that the investment risk from proceeds rests entirely with the shareholders  etf lending exposes shareholders to counter party risk  etf companies differ greatly on their policies regarding lending and shareholder splits on fees vanguard gives investors  of their profits from lending wisdom tree  and ishares wont discuss its lending policies in summary dfas strategies outlined above aim to add value well above pure indexes and etfs  although we always recommend and prefer dfas offerings for equity allocations our philosophy at eam is candid but not dogmatic and we sometimes mix dfa funds with vanguard funds or etf offerings if clients wish copyright  evanson asset management®  all rights reserved site

expensive computing power and extensive experience cannot in the aggregate outperform the market and those managers who will beat the market cannot be identified in advance  trading strategies are always changing  risk parity trading did very well until  then fell behind other strategies trading on price momentum has been popular for decades though research indicates that trading costs offset returns  high frequency trading with supercomputers running nanosecond fast data purchased from exchanges dominate the markets in  often holding positions in milliseconds  it is unlikely retail investors will beat the market trading stocks few investment activities are as exhilarating as researching a stock buying it watching its price double in a few months and taking your profits a huge industry exists to feed this desire the financial media constantly provide ideas and strategies that might make money particularly fast money trading stocks unfortunately stock trading is a form of gambling and has the same outcome eventually if not immediately traders are very likely to underperform the market or lose money just what are the facts on trading stocks  professional money managers cannot in the aggregate outperform the markets  fulltime professional money managers and mutual fund managers control trillions of stock market dollars  despite very low trading costs teams of research analysts with advanced degrees inside connections and sophisticated mathematical and computer models they do not consistently beat the average chance returns given by markets  we discuss this elsewhere on our website in active versus passive management  its folly for an individual investor to believe hell beat the professionals or the markets particularly if he gets his ideas from the mainstream financial mediaand the research evidence is clear  by the time the retail investor gets a stock idea from cnbc the wsj or barrons the proprietary accounts at big brokerage firms and investment banks and mutual funds already own them  a retail investor is very unlikely to beat the street which is itself unlikely to beat the indexes  retail investors often believe that have special knowledge during bull markets leading to an old wall street saying dont mistake a bull market for brains past performance of professional managers doesnt predict their future performance  while active professional traders are quick to point to the minority of managers and mutual funds which outperform the market as evidence of their skill those who will beat the market cannot be selected in advance because past performance doesnt predict future performancea mountain of evidence from numerous studies supports this view  eam sometimes talks with individual retail investors who claim they have outperformed the markets through timing or trading strategies  while this is often the result of selective memory even those who have beaten the market cannot be sure they will do so in the futurein fact the dalbar studies referenced elsewhere on this site show that retail stock investors are likely to produce cd like returns for  year periods investment firms and advisors never guarantee future returns because they know that they dont know how well they will do  no active professional traders are so sure of their stock trading skills that they will guarantee investors theyll beat market averages or compensate investors if they fail to do so optimism about their skills and offerings is however always high  if the professionals are unlikely to beat change returns individual investors shouldnt be confident they can either  several studies of selftraded accounts at discount brokerages indicate that the average amateur investor does about as well as the average professional if hes a light trader and the more he trades the poorer his returns  trading frequently destroy profits  professional trading systems are always changing  traders are forever hoping to find hot stocks or better still a system for selecting stocks that will consistently yield profits  perhaps the alltime most popular stock trading system is value line a widely distributed proprietary stock selection manual found in many public libraries  it boasts impressive theoretical results soundly beating the market  yet of the three mutual funds run by value line none managed to beat the s  p  index let alone capture the remarkable theoretical returns it claims  bill oneill founder of investors business daily and author has promoted price momentum trading for  years makes big claims for his chart interpretations yet the mutual fund he ran underperformed the market  as of  high frequency trading hft with supercomputers dominates the market and accounts for  to  of all trading on the major exchanges  in the early s there was no hft  hft computers are colocated a few feet from exchanges and purchase exchange data and receive quotes a few nanoseconds before other traders  hft computers then place trades thousands of times per second with strategies like quote stuffing and cascading and front run and manipulate prices  such trading has nothing to do with company fundamentals traditional technical trading or macroeconomic based trading models  the individual investor is a pawn in this predatory game  the hft industry of course claims it adds liquidity and value to markets wall street and the financial media provide retail investors with a continuous stream of tempting investment ideas  pundits fund managers financial experts of all stripes books newsletters and seminars stimulate the desires of the stock trading public  one of the more popular books is william oneills how to make money in stocks  he publishes a daily investment newspaper offers books and conducts seminars claiming big profits from his stock selection system  like value line there appears to be a substantial gap between theory and performance oneills mutual fund failed to outperform the s  p  and was finally sold to another fund company  hundreds of newsletters are published monthly to assist stock traders in choosing profitable stocks and timing markets  they dont work  only one newsletter of  survivors from  through  beat the market  from  to  only two newsletterss out of  beat the market  most newsletters dont last long enough to create longterm track records and chance alone should have produced far more market beating newsletters  fundamental traders do thorough research on the financial statements of companies their management and the industries they compete in  they then choose stocks they believe to be undervalued by some set of criteria  for example earnings per share growth rates are sometimes considered a very important determinant of future stock prices and are announced and commented on constantly by the financial press  research indicates earnings growth is a weak predictor of future company growth and share price growth and often far off the mark  worse still the majority of professional and retail investors today have short holding periods while investing based on company fundamentals assumes that time measured in years will be required to realize the value in a company  technical traders pay close attention to stock prices volume and chart patterns analyzing them with statistical techniques and intuition  predictions are made about what stocks or industries or asset classes will go up or down  unfortunately research on stock price behavior has found that only a tiny fraction of future stock prices  to  can be explained by historical price data  many studies have found that typical technical formulas fall apart under rigorous statistical examination though all systems work at least occasionally macroeconomic traders are forever trying to appraise the condition and direction of the economy from the continuous flow of government statistics  usually predictions are also made as to what the federal reserve will do and many economists and financial pundits try to interpret the feds ambiguous and optimistic language in its public pronouncements  this macroeconomic approach is then used to predict which market sectors and stocks will do well  unfortunately macroeconmic data from government statistical agencies is of questionable quality constantly revised and spun in the most optimistic manner possible by the financial press  research indicates that economists and economic experts have no greater skill than  chance guessing in predicting future economic events  we examine this elsewhere on our website in economists and economics  dishonesty is endemic in the investment business  just like the gambling business the stock trading advisory and publishing business has its share of dishonest practitioners  investment guru wade cook promised that for up to  for a three day seminar hed teach investors how to double their money every three months in the stock market  more than  people attended his seminars in  netting his company  million  in  his publically traded corporation lost  trading its own account while the market went up   promises and future performance frequently diverge in the world of stock trading advice  bernie madoffs longrunning and hugely profitable ponzi scheme fooled even professional investors and major investment firms  bernie madoof said that he was surprised he hadnt been found out years earlier  investors are impressed by investment experts even experts cant pick stocks well  a wsj article  why you shouldnt trust wall streets top stocks for  examined the price performance of  stocks analysts rated most highly as buys and  stocks analysts expected to do the worst  in  and  analysts top rated stocks trailed the sp by  and  respectively while their sell rated stocks beat the sp by an incredible  in   in  their top rated stocks beat the sp by  but their sell rated stocks beat the sp by   numerous studies confirm these findings  theres little if any evidence that trained professionals can pick stocks any better than random chance  investment clubs may be comforting but are unlikely to provide investors with above market returns  investment clubs of which there were some  plus in the us in  often get financial media coverage when a particular club produces exceptional returns  for many years the beardstown ladies stock club frequently mentioned in the wsj boasted an average return of  annually and sold millions of copies of books full of stock trading tips  unfortunately in  it was discovered that their record keeping was inadequate and their real returns were under  below those given by market indexes  other studies have found that investment clubs in the aggregate underperform the markets even jim cramer on cnbc doesnt beat the market  the folly of trading hot stock ideas is dramatically illustrated by jim cramers popular cnbc show mad money  a former hedge fund manager and allegedly hot stock picker barrons lead article on august   reported that over the prior two years cramers stocks were up about  while the dow rose  and the sp   diversified equally weighted dfa equity portfolios returned around   over more than  stocks he recommended in  cramer trailed the sp return by   barrons found that selling cramers recommendations short offered an opportunity to make  to  per year  worse still barrons revealed some of cramers hedge fund strategies  they are not atypical for wall street and also are not illegal  cramers firm would build a position in a stock which had petered out then hunt up some bullish news on the company and feed it to sellside analysts and financial reporters and viewers  on the subsequent rise cramer and company would profit by selling out their position  buzz merchandizing is what cramer calls it  most investors today do not realize that stock selling and trading was regarded as a highly unreputable business full of gamblers and con artists until the s and didnt reachieve acceptance after the  crash until well after wwii  decades of advertising lobbying and political contributions by brokerage firms and huge public relations campaigns paid off  stock trading could become disreputable again in the future particularly given what occured in  conclusion  since there is little evidence that retail investors or professionals can consistently beat average market returns and a great deal of evidence that no one can predict where the market or individual stocks are going investors should avoid trading stocks  investors should particularly avoid listening to hot stock ideas or following trading systems promoted by the financial media  eam recommends that money allocated to stocks should be invested in a diversified portfolio of passive asset

managementlow cost fixed annual retainer fees back to home page client section email password updated november  investment risks abstract  investment risk is typically presented to investors in terms of the probable standard deviation of their asset mix  however standard deviations are simply a measure of volatility in portfolios  investors are more likely to experience risk in their portfolios in terms of price declines in worst cases and how long those declines last and how permanent those declines might be  this article examines nine general categories of investment risk including price declines default risk bank failures currency risk macroeconomic risks moral risk liquidity risk capital controls catastrophe risk and cyber risk  risk can arise instantly without warning from multiple factors about investment risks all investments entail risk whether bought and sold on public exchanges or privately  it is imperative investors understand there is always some risk of a decline in price in any investment or a total loss  this article summarizes nine categories of risk and is intended to provide a general summary of the risks investors face  additional investment risks not listed in this overview exist  another article on our website risk and return examines the statistics of portfolio risk and financial superstructures examines nonquantifiable risks to investment markets price declines  this probably is the most common way investors think of risk the risk of a decline in the value of their investments  countless factors can lead to declines in the value of stocks bonds mutual funds real estate gold commodities or other investments  these include but are not limited to earnings disappointments analyst downgrades changing industry regulations declining industry or company competitiveness credit crises terrorist attacks natural disasters manias panics and crashes corporate fraud exchange rate shifts market manipulation by major players cash price manipulations caused by futures contracts flash crashes from high frequency trading and normal longterm variations in means and variances for asset classes for up to  years  if something is traded its price will vary and may decline for an extended period longer than an investor may be willing to wait default risk  when an individual bond defaults at least temporarily the bond has little or no value  often investors will have to wait for an indefinite period of time and receive less than full value when a refund is finally made if it is made  numerous factors can generate bond defaults including excessive leverage corporate fraud failing financial conditions for issuers and declining revenues for debt service  and as the collapse of enron and worldcom and the  credit crisis dramatically illustrated ratings companies like moodys and sp may not provide investors with accurate advance assessments of credit quality  even bond insurance companies can fail  defaults by countries on sovereign treasury debt have been common throughout financial history  see the book review on our website this time is different by reinhart and rogoff   counterparty risks  counterparties in a variety of securities transactions including entities involved in the creation and redemption of etf shares bond issuers mortgage issuers and derivatives issuers can fail to honor their contractual promises resulting in losses to investors  clearing houses which move money between buyers and sellers can also fail bank failures  it is not uncommon for banks and insurance companies to fail even old and established ones  in the  barings bank a venerable yearold english firm was destroyed by one rogue derivatives trader   currency risk  all paper money often called fiat currency because countries declare its value by dictate has ultimately declined to zero value  there are no exceptions  the us dollar for example has lost over  of its purchasing power since the federal reserve was created in   the feds initial mandate was to maintain stable prices  equities and bonds are often called paper assets to distinguish them from real estate commodities and precious metals which are real assets existing in the real world  thus us investors in equities and bonds are essentially buying paper promises in the us dollar a fiat currency and itself a paper promise  a rapid devaluation in the us dollar could cause a rapid decline in the value of equities and bonds traded on us exchanges   macroeconomic risk  depressions inflation and hyperinflation can lower or destroy asset values for a decade or more  history clearly shows us that they arent frequent but probably occur more often than most investors expect  in the th century the united states was fortunate to have unquestioned world dominance in industrial production gdp output military strength and other important measures yet it suffered from one major depression and one serious bout of inflation both lasting more than a decade  timing these events was of course impossible  in addition central banks and governments often resort to inflationary policies and excessive fiat currency issuance through borrowing and printing these macroeconomic maneuvers may support or increase the nominal value of investment assets short term but lead to inflation and asset bubbles and crashes later on moral risk  for want of a better term moral risk applies to countless legal and illegal schemes by which corporations analysts investment firms regulators and others misrepresent material issues play accounting games engage in insider trading or manipulate markets  anyone who has followed financial news over the last decade knows that these events are pretty much regular occurrences and anyone who has studied the history of financial markets knows that this has always been the case  a few recent examples are enron worldcom countrywide and the goldman scheme where a hedge fund manager directed goldman to assemble a portfolio of mortgages which had a high probability of failing and goldman then sold them to its clients  ninetynine percent of the mortgages failed yet due to legal technicalities neither goldman nor the manager suffered any consequences  an article elswhere on our website financial superstructures examines the many entities involved directly or indirectly in financial markets the interests of participants within them and how they influence market returns the prospect of big money typically in the tens of millions or greater today often draws participants into financial misbehavior  typically the consequences for doing so consist of a fine which is often paid by proceeds from the shareholders in the corporation not the executives and money managers who perpetrate these schemes  in fact corporations often buy insurance to protect executives from lawsuits  the fines paid usually constitute a small percentage of the profits made from the scheme and it is very rare for perpetrators to face jail or prison time  fines are typically paid without admitting or denying guilt  many observers believe that these fines are simply rationalized as a cost of doing business liquidity risk  far less frequently considered by investors and infrequently mentioned in the financial press is illiquidity  illiquidity occurs when securities which could normally be bought and sold on exchanges or in various markets cannot be bought or sold for some period of time  the market has failed  the financial industry and financial media dont like to mention illiquidity since the idea of orderly and liquid markets is the backbone of modern capitalism sellers and buyers want to assume that they can buy or sell a security if and when they wish to all markets for all securities have been subject to trading halts circuit breakers and at times been frozen or abandoned by the firms which run exchanges or markets  examples include the nyse shut down for  months in wwi and for several days after  the flash crash of may   and the abandonment of the auction rate market in february  by goldman blackrock nuveen and other auction brokers  the new york times  stock market flaws not so rare data shows reported that trading had been blocked at least  times across the nations  stock exchanges in  and this number had been rising every year since   bond markets can be closed but the major risk is that bondholders simply cannot obtain bids and thus their bonds cannot be sold capital controls  economic history clearly demonstrates that governments and financial regulators in the midst of a financial crisis will do pretty much what they want to with private investment assets businesses and markets  often called capital controls these include suspending or setting maximum withdrawals from banks or money markets curtailing or suspending international bank transfers and foreign exchange transactions blocking short selling to support equity markets criminalizing the purchase ownership or exportation of precious metals and fixing a nations exchange rate rather than letting the market do so  in september  the sec halted short selling in financial stocks to protect investors and markets  a more accurate description would be that the sec halted short selling in order to prop up major us investment banks which would have become insolvent had the markets been allowed to operate as they are supposed to and engage in price discovery in  fdr forbade private ownership of gold and effectively devalued the us dollar  holders of gold were paid ounce and once all gold in private hands had been collected gold was revalued to ounce effectively devaluing the value of what the former owners of the gold received by about   in  the us congress voted to use all social security contributions for current government expenses putting ious in place to fund future obligations for social security recipients  repayment of these ious is dependent upon future us government borrowing not incurred until the social security distributions are needed  the estimated unfunded liabilities of the social security trust fund are over  trillion as of   since  social security has been cash flow negative with current contributions from current workers failing to match current distributions to social security recipients  and there is no social security trust fund though that term is used frequently  the trust fund is just a reassuring name for nonnegotiable ious to be funded by presumed future us treasury borrowing in  the argentinian government defaulted on its debt the largest sovereign default in history and during the  financial crisis its borrowing costs rose so high that the socialist government nationalized a substantial portion of private pensions to help pay its debts  as of  at least one us think tank and several congresspeople have discussed nationalizing us ks in exchange for gras guaranteed retirement accounts where the us government promises to pay an inflationadjusted subsidy administered by social security  in august  the polish government nationalized half of their citizens private retirement plans  while unlikely it could happen to us investors catastrophe risk  natural or manmade catastrophes can rock financial markets and securities prices  recent examples include  and hurricane katrina  investment companies can use exigent circumstances or force majeure as a defense against claims of loss by investors cyberrisk  this is probably the least talked about risk in publically traded securities but it is real present and growing  in february  an article appeared reporting that hackers had invaded the nasdaq trading system wall street journal   reuters  reported that new details showed the cyberattack was more serious than previously thought  it seems hackers installed malicious software that allowed them to spy on confidential information on exchanges and documents circulated amongst boards of directors  nasdaq also said that they were not clear how long nasdaqs system was breached before the attack was discovered and that they are spending about one billion dollars a year on information security  hackers launched six attacks against the european unions carbon trading systems and stole  million pounds financial times  and chinese hackers mounted multiple cyberattacks against leading oil and gas companies financial times   stewart baker former assistant secretary of homeland security said to the financial times that the intrusion on the oil and gas companies could well be the chinese government but i cant say the government would even have to be aware of it  hackers used previously known software flaws and did not go to great lengths to cover their tracks researchers saidthe us government accused the chinese of being the worlds most active and persistent perpetrators of economic spying and also said russian intelligence agents are conducting extensive spying to collect us
