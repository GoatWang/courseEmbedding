manager qa february   view as pdf fund managers richard malnight key takeaways for the fiscal year ending february   the fund rose  topping the  return of the msci us imi chemicals  index by a wide margin the msci industry index outpaced the broader sp ® with chemicals stocks and other more economically sensitive investments outperforming as global economic fears receded a surge of chemicals firms pursuing mergers acquisitions and other strategic alternatives also appealed to investors versus the msci industry index the funds timely ownership of diversified chemicals firm chemours helped for the full year a reversal from six months ago being underweight fertilizer producer cf industries for most of the year and then shifting to an overweight late in the year also aided relative results conversely overweightings in higherquality names including wr grace and ppg industries hampered the funds relative result many higherquality firms struggled this period the fund is positioned less conservatively at period end as portfolio manager rick malnight is focusing less on highquality but highly valued firms and more on identifying stocks he considers mispriced on october   rick malnight became portfolio manager of the fund succeeding mahmoud sharaf qa an interview with portfolio manager rick malnight rick how did the fund and industry perform for the fiscal year ending february   the fund gained  well ahead of the  result of the msci industry index which in turn finished well ahead of the broadmarket sp ® the fund also outperformed its peer group average for the year what factors influenced the performance of chemicals stocks most this period the chemicals industry generally is closely tied to the state of the economy – the price of oil in particular chemicals stocks benefited this period as concern receded about several global economic developments including slowing growth in china and further collapse in oil prices investors began to favor procyclical more economically sensitive investments – such as chemicals stocks – that stood to benefit from potential global growth the industry experienced a surge of firms pursuing mergers and acquisitions mas and other strategic alternatives that piqued investors interest generally a rise in merger activity can be a sign of industry consolidation that in turn may boost stock prices and returns as an example six of the seven largest firms in the msci industry index are currently involved in major ma transactions please describe how your investment philosophy and process differ from mahmoud sharafs previously employed strategy i would have to start with the fact that i come from a highyield background and because of this i think my investment positioning is slightly less conservative than that of the previous portfolio manager my views also differ in that i am more optimistic on the outlook for the global economy to avoid recession which reinforces my lessconservative stance as a result i might consider names carrying higher debt levels – stocks that previously might have been excluded – provided they represent what i view as a mispricing opportunity or a stock in which i have differentiated conviction in the first half of the period investors favored riskier more economically sensitive stocks mahmoud tended to avoid such names and this accounted for some of the funds modest underperformance versus the msci industry index early on take strongperforming chemours for example avoiding this index name detracted in the summer of  i took the small position established in september and built it up to a sizable overweighting the funds stake in chemours soared  making it the largest individual contributor for the year despite only being held in the final six months of the period the diversified chemicals firm is a  spinoff of industry giant dupont which was the funds largest holding this period what other factors helped the fund outperform the industry index another contributor was a nonindex stake in univar our position in this chemical distributor rose  the past year i was confident that the companys new ceo steve newlin would be able to make a positive impact on the firm whose margins were lagging competitors investors liked the change in leadership as well and rewarded the stock timely positioning in fertilizer producer cf industries holdings was our thirdlargest relative contributor the fund began the period with an underweighting in cf due to a bearish view of the firms supplydemand fundamentals as the period progressed our exposure was reduced further as the firm continued to face regulatory scrutiny related to its proposed acquisition of netherlandsbased oci the proposal sought two goals – to create the worlds largest publicly traded maker of nitrogenbased fertilizers and to reduce the combined firms taxes the deal was abandoned in may shortly after the us treasury took steps to curb taxavoiding inversion deals and the stock was sold from the fund in june i repurchased cf industries in november when i believed nitrogen prices had bottomed this benefited the fund as the stock rebounded in the fourth quarter of  the fund also benefited from positions in targa resources and williams partners which provide natural gas storage and transportation as well as services separating natural gas liquids ngls that are key feedstocks for ethylene production both firms appreciated significantly due to the recovery in oil prices and the favorable outlook for ngls demand from new us ethylene capacity what hampered relative performance overweight stakes in wr grace and ppg industries proved detrimental this period as the stocks failed to perform our positions gained just over  and  for the period respectively both positions represent examples of higherquality companies that underperformed in recent months due to challenges surrounding growth potential of established businesses in the current environment ashland global holdings also hurt i pulled back from the funds overweighting and brought the position closer to indexneutral due to a lack of strong views on the firm lastly our cash position of about  on average was a big negative against a strong market i have sought to minimize our cash position since taking over the fund what other changes have you made to the portfolio since taking the lead though they did not come up as top contributors or detractors this period our larger stakes in dupont and dow are worth a mention i have significantly increased the funds cumulative position with the hope of capturing potential valuation benefits from their plan to merge and then fragment into three separate morefocused companies also i more than doubled our stake in lyondellbasell industries unfortunately for the fund the stocks  return proved a relative detractor the full year despite this drag i believe investors worries regarding future us ethylene capacity were excessive and that lyondellbasell stock had become undervalued what trends are you following at period enda major theme – one that could help determine a number of factors for the industry in the neartointermediate term – is the debate over the levels both of production and of consumption of us ethylene moving forward i will touch on this subject in more detail following this interview additionally it appears to me that special situations – including ma activity and selfhelp measures such as cost cutting – are driving value and shaping the industry landscape against a slowgrowth backdrop currently roughly  of the industry is involved in ma activity in one form or another a number of firms are continuing to break apart and move to niche areas of the market in order to satisfy investors preference for morefocused companies over conglomerates it will be interesting to see how this alters the investment landscape moving forward ■ rick malnight on the ethylene debate and its implications for the investment landscape ethylene is one of the most important chemicals in the global market representing a key building block across multiple supply chains how to paraphrase just one word plastics annual global production of polyethylene plastic – just one ethylene end product – is around  million tons the primary process for creating ethylene is through the steam cracking of hydrocarbon molecules in recent years we have witnessed how the introduction of shale gas – a byproduct of the fracking process – could disrupt the chemicals industry fracking helped the us transition from a highcost to a lowcost producer of oil  gas – and therefore ethylene this change led to record earnings for us ethylene producers and their stock prices rose steadily from – higher growth and revenue resulted in a number of firms increasing capacity for the first time in decades this led investors to believe the industry could be on track to experience a typical cyclical downturn that can result from overcapacity indeed ethylene stocks traded as if overcapacity were certain various opinions have swirled around the ramifications of potential future us ethylene capacity growth where do we go from here a number of firms have announced plans to start up new capacity projects in  and  in  and  however new capacity growth is scheduled to slow dramatically which could tip the global ethylene market back to tight supplydemand conditions in my view however only time will tell how this ultimately will play out market recap the us equity bellwether sp ® index gained  for the year ending february   rising sharply in the periods final four months on renewed optimism for economic growth the beginning of the period saw improving investor sentiment amid us job gains a rally in energy and other stimuli that helped keep the sevenyear bull uptrend intact markets tumbled briefly following brexit – the uks june vote to exit the european union –recovering quickly to settle into a flattish stretch until the november us presidential election stocks then broke out in response to donald trumps surprise victory surging to a series of new alltime highs on expectations for reflation and fiscal stimulus for the year financials  proved the topperforming sector by far riding an uptick in bond yields and a rally in banks especially postelection industrials  energy  and materials  also fared well the latter two driven by a cyclical rebound in commodity prices information technology rose  despite cooling off late in  conversely real estate and health care each returned  lagging

average because morningstar has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high low this fund scores low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other
