demand for sustainable foodstaking the chicken out of the egg and the cow out of meat bob woods special to cnbccom thursday  may    am etcnbccom shares show chapters wheres the meat in the veggies impossible foods    friday  may    am et   this is not a product for vegetarians claimed patrick brown a stanford biologist and physician turned foodtech entrepreneur about the meatless yet purposely meatlike hamburger his redwood city californiabased startup impossible foods is developing our whole reason for doing this is to provide choices for people who are uncompromising meat lovers up the road in san francisco josh tetrick a former college linebacker and fulbright scholar insisted that his threeyearold food company hampton creek which uses a laboratoryborn egg substitute to make mayonnaise and cookies is not about reaching out to healthconscious consumers our whole philosophy is that if you crave something that tastes really freakin good and is less expensive even if you dont give a damn you end up choosing it source impossible foods although this pair of ceos are vegans theyre adamant about not preaching veganism or vegetarianism to the masses instead they say they are part of the sustainable food movement which includes the existing spate of soybased meat substitutes as well as organics and freerange animals theyre among a growing group of global leaders who are making it their business to confront the dramatic growth of the worlds population estimated to exceed  billion by  which would require raising overall food production by at least  percent the fao reports a huge burden on the planets livestock land water and other resources so while brown and tetrick decry the global multitrilliondollar big food industry for wreaking havoc on farm animals and the environment theyre also passionate about pioneering betterforyou alternatives that make great business sense—just without proselytizing and although theyre confident that their plantbased products bioengineered to mimic beef and eggs will appeal to omnipresent omnivores likeminded venture capitalists are already voracious read morefull list  disruptor  im interested in both companies because theyre disrupting the food industry which is long overdue said samir kaul a partner at khosla ventures the first among numerous vc firms and private investors to have infused  million into hampton creek and  million into impossible foods both of them are providing food that is as good if not better as cheap if not cheaper and much healthier and more humanely made similarly sociallyminded financial backers of those and other foodtech startups—such as beyond meat modern meadow unreal candy nutek salt and bright farms—include microsofts bill gates peter thiel of founders fund hong kong billionaire li kashings horizons ventures and twin brothers and serial investors ali and hadi partovi thats because the market these disruptive companies are targeting is ripe for change raising meat takes a great deal of land and water and has a substantial environmental impact gates wrote on his personal blog gatesnotescom put simply theres no way to produce enough meat for  billion people yet we cant ask everyone to become vegetarians thats why we need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources dichotomy turns out to be a major ingredient in hampton creeks and impossible foods recipes for success it goes beyond marketing meat replacements to unapologetic meat eaters beginning with the formulation of the products themselves hampton creek unleashed a team of data scientists and computational biologists to analyze nearly  plant molecules and build a reasonable facsimile of the chicken egg using proteins from the canadian yellow pea and an american variety of sorghum getty images hampton creeks just mayo contains a laboratoryborn egg substitute whether you want to call it disruptive or exponential innovation theres going to be a transformation in the food industry barb renner vice chairman and us consumer products practice leader deloitte llp its science that produces the allnatural nongmo elements inside the companys introductory products just mayo and just cookies predictably theyre popular at whole foods and healthfood stores yet also share shelf space alongside hellmanns and chips ahoy at walmart target dollar tree and other big food purveyors we think we can use the power of their infrastructure to make a big difference tetrick said of what might seem to some as strange bedfellows indeed hellmanns parent unilever sued hampton creek last fall declaring that mayonnaise by definition contains eggs but backed off when media coverage only boosted just mayos exposure read morebilliondollarbacked unicorns that actually make things tetrick followed the same strategy when he struck a deal with compass group usa the nations largest foodservice company and its procurement arm foodbuy to sell hampton creek products to healthcare organizations senior living centers universities and other institutional food providers were the only cookie or the only mayo at boeing hp google and lucasfilms skywalker ranch boasted tetrick about contracts with corporate cafeterias thats a huge part of our company impossible foods meanwhile can only imagine such realities as rd on its impossible burger continues toward a product launch in  effectively raw ground beef made entirely from plant ingredients it even bleeds thanks to heme a replica of a molecule in hemoglobin extracted from the roots of legumes the burger gets better every week said brown whose team of scientists chefs farmers and engineers began tinkering with plants a year and a half ago hundreds of taste tests of prototypes have gone well were at a point where it doesnt matter if youre a contractor or a chef if you arent told that it is anything other than ground beef youll assume it is we now have to produce a consistently great product at scale changing consumer appetites marketing plans are in the developmental stage too though brown is keeping specifics under wrap suffice to say it will be very exciting he said hinting that the rollout will feature public events and celebrity chefs brown reiterated however that burger lovers will have no beef with his he cites research that says if an alternative could satisfy them provide all the pleasure they get from eating meat but was made from plants they would prefer it adept at mixing molecules and metaphors he added if they could have their cake and eat it too that would be a good thing read moregoogle is even more influential than you think naturally or not big food isnt ceding the betterforyou category to this new breed of food techies whether you want to call it disruptive or exponential innovation theres going to be a transformation in the food industry said barb renner vice chairman deloitte llp and us consumer products practice leader but i dont think its limited to just startups in early may panera bread announced that the restaurant chain will remove all artificial preservatives colors sweeteners and flavors from its foods by the end of  the st louis company joined at least a dozen big food companies and restaurant businesses that plan to reformulate products to eliminate ingredients deemed unsafe or unhealthy nestlé usa is ridding some candies of artificial flavors and colors hershey is ditching highfructose corn syrup kraft will use real spices to color its macaroni and cheese orange mcdonalds and tyson foods said separately that they will eliminate antibiotics from their chickens—just before a deadly outbreak of avian flu struck iowa poultry farms this all plays into the growing consumer demand for transparency and simplicity in food production which may ironically become a question mark for these hightech disruptors suggested rachel cheatham ceo of chicagobased foodscape group an industry consultancy and an adjunct professor of nutrition marketing at tufts university the irony is that people who cried out for those kinds of products the last thing they wanted was a lot of engineering in their food she said if you build a better nonmeat patty youd better think ahead to the transparency around how many ingredients are in it what they are and the supply chain show chapters hampton creek a gamechanger in the food space    friday  may    pm et   it potentially presents a fine line to tread where consumers are told that the latest meatless alternatives made with big data and genomics are okay our ingredients are naturally occurring proteins and nutrients brown said i would contrast that with the product were competing against —by bob woods special to cnbccom related securities symbol price   change change wfm

flexngate break ground on nearly m new detroit manufacturing facility plant to create up to  jobs posted on   pm global auto supplier to be newest tenant at i industrial park flexngate committed to hiring detroiters first detroitbased minority owned contractors to help build facility   mayor mike duggan flexngate owner shad khan along with state and local officials and community leaders today officially broke ground on the global auto supplier’s new  million manufacturing facility on the city’s east side it will be the largest investment by an auto supplier in the city of detroit in over  years the  square foot facility which is expected to open about a year from now will become a new centerpiece to the city’s growing i industrial park and is a sign of the city and state’s success in attracting more manufacturing jobs back to detroit   flexngate is a top global auto supplier of exterior trim components aluminum and steel modular stamped body in white and chassis assemblies lighting and other oem automotive products announced last year the facility will supply parts to ford motor company and will create at least  and up to  new jobs in detroit over the next three years at full capacity up to  total jobs could be added flexngate has committed to hiring  of its construction workforce from within the city of detroit and awarding at least  of construction work to detroitbased companies tooles contracting group a detroitbased and minority owned company has been selected to perform the majority of civil work prior to construction of the new facility flexngate also has committed to develop a comprehensive hiring plan in conjunction with the city’s human rights department and detroit employment solutions corp to help ensure permanent jobs for detroiters a general contractor to lead construction will be selected in the months ahead as the facility nears completion flexngate will hold job fairs where interested detroiters can learn more about jobs being offered and apply residents interested in applying can learn more at wwwflexngatecomdetroit most of the hiring will take place in mid once the facility is complete “this new facility is an example of how detroit has become much more attractive to large manufacturers like flexngate” said mayor mike duggan “shad khan has made a strong commitment to hiring detroiters and use detroitbased contractors and is committed to using this project and this new facility to provide employment opportunities to as many detroiters as possible they have been a great community partner” “i have always believed that the embodiment of the american dream is in manufacturing and nowhere is that dream becoming more real and attainable for workers and families today than in the us auto industry” khan said “detroit is the birthplace of us automakers and today detroit is experiencing a manufacturing rebirth not only throughout the region but specifically within the city limits our new facility at the i industrial park will enable flexngate to serve our customers better than ever but the headline for me is one word – jobs” “in fact these are excellent jobs that will build promising careers with a hiring emphasis on men and women who live in the city of detroit we’re also committed to making sure detroit citybased and minority‑owned companies like tooles contracting group are strongly represented during every phase of the build today’s groundbreaking is a day for celebration but the best days and years for flexngate and the city of detroit are still to come” to support the project the detroit city council recently approved a m property tax abatement in addition to the facility’s construction georgia street along the planned facility’s south side will be resurfaced as part of a separate  million grant from the us department of commerce and the economic development administration the street improvements came out of the community engagement process for the project where residents voiced concerns of bad roads from increased truck traffic the georgia street improvements will fortify the streets for the new trucks this new multilayered investment provides a major boost to the i industrial park and is the culmination of a collaborative effort among the city of detroit detroit economic growth corporation and the michigan economic development corporation medc which administers incentives and programs on behalf of the michigan strategic fund medc also serves as the state’s chief business attraction and marketing agency along with directing the pure michigan campaign from  through the second quarter of  automakers and auto suppliers have made  billion investments into michigan accounting for about  percent of autoindustry investment in north america since  through the end of last year  manufacturing jobs have been created in michigan according to the center for automotive research “i’m proud of the jobs that will be created for district three and detroit residents” said councilmember scott benson “and i’m so proud of the impact that residents in district three have had on the development process”    categories press releases mayor  view count

bulbs allium bulbs tulip bulbs crocus bulbs shop for fall bulbs planting flower bulbs is fast easy and nearly foolproof fall bulbs are loved by both beginner and master gardeners there are so few issues to consider gardeners can put all their effort into the fun part of gardening — design fall allows a “second season” of planting for spring blooming bulbs planting in the fall allows a jumpstart to spring growth the cool weather helps to make a more enjoyable experience for working outside in the garden and requires less watering the cooler weather allows spring blooming bulbs to winter over this is important in order for bulbs to provide beautiful spring cheerful blooms when bulbs arrive bulbs should be planted as soon as the ground is cool when evening temperatures average between  ° to  deg f you should plant at least six weeks before the ground freezes this is most common in cold climates zones  you can if necessary store bulbs for a month or longer if you keep them in a cool dry place planting fall bulbs in warm climates zones  such as tulips crocus hyacinths grape hyacinths scilla and snowdrops require prechilling in order to bloom to prechill leave bulbs in their bags and place in a refrigerator for  weeks be careful not to store bulbs near fruit especially apples all ripening fruit give off ethylene gas ethylene gas can damage and or kill the flower inside the bulb once bulbs are chilled plant them at the coolest time of the year most importantly bulbs wont last till next season so make sure to plant them read the label try to keep the label together with the bulbs until planting without the label you cant tell the red tulips from the white ones just by looking at the bulbs where to plant you can plant bulbs just about anywhere in your garden as long as the soil drains well the dutch say bulbs dont like wet feet so avoid areas where water collects such as the bottom of hills bulbs like sun and in many areas the spring garden can be very sunny since the leaves on the trees are not out yet so keep in mind when planting in the fall that you can plant in many places for spring blooms prepare the planting bed dig soil so its loose and workable if its not an established garden bed chances are the soil could use the addition of some organic matter such as compost or peat moss these are available at most local garden retailers how to plant bulbs – step by step instructions step  loosen soil in the planting bed to a depth of at least ” remove any weeds rocks or other debris you can mix in compost other organic matter or slow releasing fertilizer if your soil lacks nutrients step  depending on the bulb follow the recommendation on the label for planting depth as a general rule plant big bulbs about  deep and small bulbs about  deep set the bulb in the hole pointy side up or the roots down its easy to spot the pointy end of a tulip tougher with a crocus if you cant figure out the top from the bottom plant the bulb on its side in most cases even if you dont get it right the flower bulb will still find its way topside step  now that the bulbs are planted back fill with soil over the hole lightly compress the soil but do not pack it water to stimulate root growth there is no need to water continuously unless you live in an area with low precipitation in the winter months aftercare in the spring fertilizing for bulbs that are intended to naturalize return for several years or for bulbs that are coming into their second year spread an organic fertilizer such as compost or a slow release bulb food on top of the soil pruning when the flowers have completed blooming cut the flower head off but do not cut the foliage bulbs will use the foliage to gather nutrients from the sun and store for the following seasons once the foliage have turned yellow or brown you can cut them to ground level design ideas plant bulbs in clusters if you plant one bulb alone or make a long thin line along the walk the impact is less desirable clusters give a concentration of color for greatest impact even if you dont have enough bulbs for a big bed small clusters can make a super spring show plant low bulbs in front of high this is a good general rule for bulbs that bloom at the same time of course there are times to break this rule for example if the low growing bulbs bloom early and the tall bulbs bloom late plant the tall in front their display will camouflage the dying foliage of the smaller bulbs read more design tips in our blog try a doubledecker effect you can plant small bulbs in a layer right on top of large bulbs if you plant bulbs that flower in the same period you can create an interesting doubledecker effect or you can stagger the bloom time by planting mid and lateseason bloomers together creating a spring display that blooms in succession for a whole season of color in the end what you do with fall bulbs is limited only by your imagination a few hours one brisk autumn afternoon can yield months of colorful excitement in your yard or garden next spring for more information on planting bulbs in the fall visit flower bulbs planting guides we want you to be successful

biennial and herbs are to be treated like flowers when planting by moon phase are you able to please correct the print and online moon phase calendars going forward they incorrectly recommend planting parsley by the waxing moon thanks again for your help lunar gardening dates we agree that this is a confusing topic and traditional lunar gardening has exceptions to rules if you look at a lunar gardening book for example you will usually find a table that lists “biennials” to plant during the dark of the moon but “herbs” and “parsley” during the light of the moon in addition in lunar gardening the period called the “first quarter” between new and first quarter moon is a good time to plant those plants with seeds on the outside such as parsley “second quarter” between first quarter moon and full moon is good for those plants that form seed pods such as peas and beans regular parsley traditionally is harvested during the light of the moon perhaps because the harvested part is aboveground and too many gardeners treat it as an annual in general though perennial and biennial herbs are planted during the dark of the moon to encourage root growth and help the longterm health of the plant perennial sage for example is planted during the dark of the moon however another mystery is horseradish a perennial and belowground crop which lunar gardening experts recommend planting during the light of the moon planting hamburg rooted parsley by moon phase i am going to be planting hamburg rooted parsley this year it is a biennial herb that produces both an above ground and a below ground crop unlike beets that primarily provide a below ground crop and many people also eat the tops hamburg rooted parsley is grown just as much for the tops as the roots any suggestion for how to plant hamburg rooted parsley by moon phase thanks parsley puzzle great question you might choose the dark of the moon dates day after full to day before new to encourage good root growth if there is good root development most likely there will be good tops too if however you really prefer the tops then you might try the light of the moon planting herbs by moon phase how are herbs classified particularly biennial varieties when it comes to planting by moon phase are they treated like flowers or vegetables im going to be planting dill this year and that prompted my questions any help would be greatly appreciated thanks and happy gardening herbs we’d suggest for annual herbs plant during the light of the moon unless the harvested part is below ground in which case plant by the dark of the moon biennial and perennial herbs plant during the dark of the moon as one does with biennial and perennial flowers to encourage root growth zone helloi live on long island new york what

planting calendar on the not old farmers almanac website is even more at odds with maria thun why would this be answer tropical vs siderial zodiac it has to do with the use of siderial zodiac signs

squirrels from ruining my pecans they pick them while theyre green chew the ends off  throw them down ive tried everything ive heard of so please help thanks squirrels strip the bark from squirrels strip the bark from limbs to get moisture try watering the grass at the base of the trees early in the morning squirrels lick dew off of grass blades the squirrels actually eat my the squirrels actually eat my green pecans as well the also eat the pears and apples i remedied this problem by putting tin around the base of all trees ace hardware has the old tin pipes for the wood stoves the larger ones work well possibly  to  of them around around larger trees i also had the tops of the trees trimmed during the winter months while the sap was low that way the squirrels couldnt hop from tree to tree and eat the pecans pears and apples ive actually watched them eat them hope this helps a  or pellet gun works a  or pellet gun works well unless you are in the city but having a few cats works well in town or city there is also gopher poison that you can mix with a little bit of smashed peanuts ann have you tried using ann have you tried using essential oils specifically peppermint oil fill a pump up sprayer with partial water then the rest with partial peppermint shake it up spray it on the tree its a green thing no poisonsand see if the scent doesnt drive them crazy the peppermint will not hurt your pecans and after awhile the squirrels will leave it alone i do like essential lineup i do like essential lineup consider application based upon frequency rain fall i know that seems obvious but i worked in a greenhouse and youd be amazed also consider predator urine there is a web site that you can select a pest and are given options for predators may have multiple pests you are trying to target thepeemartcom and predator urine is inexpensive doesnt require much their sense of smell so much better than ours you also must apply more frequently with rain mole baits are often in baited worms and squirrels wouldnt eat that also toxins are toxins for just that reason must consider effects to other animals such as a household pet as well as yourself around edibles powders and sprays can often be systemically absorbed and depending on when it is time to harvest the pesticide can accumulate in the fruit hey deb the chart they have hey deb the chart they have never published is under gardening when can you tell when the when can you tell when the sap is up or down in a tree sap flows during the daytime sap flows during the daytime when the conditions are right you need cold nights below freezing and warm days above freezing it is the fluctuation that causes the flow of sap during the night the carbon dioxide cools and contracts and some sap freezes this all creates suction in the tree which causes water from the soil to be drawn up into the roots and travel up through the sapwood during the day as the temperatures rise above freezing the sap starts to flow then the process repeats itself i have several different i have several different elephant ears planted in the ground as well as a huge hydrangea i am trying to help my sister with transplanting the elephant ears and was needed the best instructions to do the process in potsin ground also the money grass the biggest questions is there any way to get cuttings from the one plant i

appreciate your help with these as i do not have a green thumb what so ever thanks desperate to share sentimental plants and shrubs suzie elephant ears have tubers and elephant ears have tubers and you can divide these to start new plants if the peace plant is a peace lily it grows horizontal roots just under the soil you can cut and divide some of these for new plants a hydrangea can be propagated from soft wood cuttings cut  inch lengths of new green stems from the bush dip the bottoms of the stems in rooting hormone and plant in small pots remove the biggest leaves to encourage root growth go to our individual plant pages at httpwwwalmanaccomcontent to read more about how to care for these plants in cold weather areas i dig in cold weather areas i dig the elephant ear roots

develop growth will slow down when air temperature is below °f if you live in a colder region you may need to give the plants some extra time to produce try cutting off some of the try cutting off some of the leaves and on some of the other leaves take a very stiff switch or stick and hit the leaf stem to the point of damaging the stem the plant will send up a substance to repair the damage you will see a knot form around the damaged area like a sling of sorts and then look for those blooms to apear try this on a few of your plants and see if they dont do much better than the others it works

th years after planting why plant small plants if you wish to create a hedge which is really dense and bushy from the ground upwards it is advisable to plant young small plants many people look at the small bare rooted seedlings or transplants and imagine it will be years before they will achieve anything which looks like a hedge if larger plants are chosen the result can often be that the hedge is rather gappy at the base also larger plants are more expensive and are more likely to fail than small ones to show how quickly a hedge can be created with the young plants we have taken a series of pictures of a few species in their first and second year of growth further photographs will be taken in the future until the hedges are mature the site this experiment is taking place on is windy and on the top of a hill in a nearby village if it was in a sheltered warm valley faster results should be obtained but the site chosen will give a better idea for average conditions in great britain getting ready for your plants to arrive please ensure you are ready for your plants as deliveries are made during week days when you may be unable to plant them or the ground could be frozen or snowcovered plants deteriorate if left in their packing too long so have an area of cultivated soil in a sheltered site prepared in advance do this by digging a trench about cm  inches deep and cover the area with polythene to keep it dry and prevent it freezing when the plants arrive unwrap them and any barerooted ones should be soaked for up to two hours in water bed the plants into the prepared trench and cover the roots with soil which should be watered if dry the plants can remain in this state until you are able to plant into their final place any pot grown plants should be watered if necessary then kept in a sheltered position until planted preparing the ground if possible get the preparation done before the winter planting season  while the weather and soil is still warm irrigate dry soils copiously before any cultivation is carried out to prepare the soil for hedges dig a trench at least cm in wide and cm ft deep along the length of the proposed hedge infilling with improved soil as necessary for individual trees or shrubs clear a circle approximately  metre   yard diameter of grass and weeds dig the area to at least cm ft deep and improve the soil structure as necessary to improve the structure of the soil incorporate generous quantities of compost such as wellrotted garden compost wellrotted farmyard manure mushroom compost or composted bark if the soil has poor drainage add sharp sand or coarse grit make sure it is limefree if the soil is heavy clay take care not to create a solid basin at the base of the trench that will stop the water from draining freely if this preparation is done in advance of planting the soil can then settle and will be workable when you come to put the plants in during the winter even if the soil is cold and frosty on the surface it will be relatively easy to turn over if it has been correctly prepared plant the new plants and mulch well with at least cm in bark chips or other mulching material around the plants you can put down landscape fabric first and plant through this mulching on top the mulch is very important as it suppresses weed growth and helps retain valuable moisture in the surrounding soil it is essential that all evergreens are sheltered from drying winds during their first winter and growing season if the weather conditions are particularly severe or the site is subject to strong prevailing winds a protective windbreak should be erected for example windbreak netting this will help to prevent the plants drying out before their roots are established for all plants it is essential that they are kept well watered during their first year even in winter when they are dormant it is important to keep them moist in march april and may just before they break dormancy as a guide in dry weather at least two gallons  litres of water per square yardmetre should be applied twice a week also it is advisable to spray over the foliage of evergreens in the evenings as well as watering use a hoseend diluter to make the task easier ensure that all tree ties are kept secure but not too tight and that no grass or weeds are allowed to grow around the plants for at least a year in the first year plants often come into leaf and flower much later than established plants and it should not be assumed that the plants have failed should they be late into leaf evergreen shrubs may drop their leaves when transplanted they should regrow new shoots within three months of planting planting with rootgrow and broadview p whether planting bare root ball root or pot grown plants we would strongly recommend using rootgrow rootgrow enhances plant’s root system so a newly planted plant can find more food nutrients and water this means you need less fertilizer the plants will establish faster and it reduces failure rates the product can only be applied whilst planting as it has to be in contact with the roots but as it is so effective it may be advisable to delay planting until you have purchased enough to treat the roots of your plants it is available from the garden centre or by mail order find out more about rootgrow here broadleaf p is the ideal product to use with rootgrow as it is a water retaining gel which the young roots can grow through and will last for up to  years by which time the plants will be well established  rain or irrigated water will be held around the root absorbing nutrients as well and these can be used by the plants when needed further details of this product are available here planting  pruning instructions when planting and caring for a new hedge it is very important to follow the pruning and planting instructions which will come with the plants or are available from the garden centre shop some people do not like to cut their hedging plants back or forget to do so and with many varieties this will result in a hedge which is not dense at the base the best hedges develop from a good basal regrowth – so ensure this prune is carried out at
