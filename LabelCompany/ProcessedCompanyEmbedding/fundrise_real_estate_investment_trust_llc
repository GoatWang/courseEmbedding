commercial real estate investing made simple home  real estate  fundrise review fundrise review  – invest in commercial real estate passively review of fundrise reviewed by ruth lyons published on july   last modified july   editor rating rated  stars invest online in commercial real estate via ereits and efunds gain access to real estate deals without the high dollar commitment typically needed without being an accredited investor and without paying the high frontend load fees however publicly traded real estate investments might be a better option commercial real estate investing can be an excellent way to grow your nest egg although it’s not without risks the big risk commercial real estate requires large amounts of upfront capital to purchase a property in order to properly diversify your portfolio you should own multiple properties various types of properties eg apartment complexes strip malls office space etc and properties in multiple locations one avenue for the small investor who wishes to invest in commercial real estate is through a reit real estate investment trust as you may know a reit owns and manages incomeproducing real estate by pooling the funds of many individual investors the reit can purchase a diversified mix of commercial properties — such as office buildings shopping centers hotels and apartments — that the typical investor might not otherwise be able to purchase individually one type of reit an exchangetraded reit is available through any broker as the name implies its shares trade on the securities markets exchangetraded reits have a few downsides however for one thing their performance is heavily correlated with the broader stock market fundrise features minimum investment  fees year accredited investor no reits yes offering types debt or equity property types commercial goal based investing new – via the fundrise  platform invest in real estate based upon your goals rather than types of investment or location ereit – a nontraded reit that invests in multiple commercial real estate compared to traditional reits cuts out the middleman saving you on commissions efund – a private fund that invests in multiple commercial real estate properites that unlike fundrise’s ereits focus on growth than income start real estate investing with as little as  what are ereits an ereit short for electronic real estate investment trust is an invention by fundrise to make investing in commercial real estate ereits are similar to investing in an etf or mutual fund fundrise’s ereits are most similar to nontraded reits the primary difference is in the fees when you invest in an ereit you don’t go through a broker — you buy directly from fundrise that allows fundrise to dramatically reduce the fees there’s no middleman so there are no upfront fees or commissions and rather than paying a frontend load of – fundrise charges just a  annual asset management fee nontraded reits and ereits are registered investments and while they’re subject to the same sec requirements that an exchangetraded reit must meet they’re not directly correlated with stock market fluctuations two downsides there isn’t the same liquidity since they’re not traded on the markets and frontend fees are higher than exchangetraded reits ereit vs nontraded reit vs publicly traded reit type ereits nontraded reits exchangetraded reits publicly traded no no yes secondary market no typically no yes frontend fees none    broker commission the minimum investment is just  for fundrise ereits and you don’t have to be an accredited investor to participate shares of the ereits are purchased exclusively online and fundrise members receive notifications when new assets are added to the ereits what is an efund an efund short for electronic fund invests in commercial real estate and is exclusive to fundrise it similar in design to a professionally managed mutual fund but like the ereits not publicly traded efunds are set up as partnerships and not corporations so they are taxed differently — saving on double taxation also like ereits fundrise offers these efunds to investors without any brokers or commissions unlike an ereit which is typically used for income fundrise’s efunds are set up for growth screenshots the fundrise ereits invest in many properties to diversify and smooth out investment returns fundrise currently offers  ereit funds to choose from supplemental income balance investing and longterm growth each ereit breaks down the risk of each property and the amount the reit has invested in unsure which fund to invest in fundrise helps with a roboadvisor like questionnaire goal based investing new fundrise currently offers three investment styles goal objective supplemental income income balanced investing income  growth long term growth growth your investments with fundrise will consist of their ereits and efunds the allocation will depend upon if you are looking for growth income or a combination of both if you are unsure which one is right for you fundrise offers a threestep questionnaire that can help determine how you should invest for the launch of their ereits fundrise offers an “accountability policy” that’s far from industry standard as an investor in their income ereit you pay  in asset management fees unless you earn at least  annualized return during the first two years of operation until dec   for their growth ereit fundrise will pay a penalty of up to  to investors if it earns less than a  noncompounded annual return fundrise is not a newcomer to real estate investing and their team has experience in many areas of the real estate marketplace in  they had  million in real estate assets under management and provided an average annual return of  net to their investors quick comparison  —read the reviewread the reviewrating rated  stars rated  stars rated  stars min depositfeesyear  yearfreeaccredited investornonono pros low minimum — the minimum investment to start with fundrise is  low fees — fundrise charges only a  asset management fee per year no accreditation — unlike competing firms fundrise is open to any investor in the united states regardless of income or net worth diversification — unlike other private reits fundrise ereits have a pool of many properties that could smooth out returns day guarantee — unheard of in the investment industry if at any time during your first  days as an investor you’re not satisfied fundrise will buy your investment back at the original investment amount this offer is subject to certain limitations commercial real estate access — commercial real estate is typically a highdollar investment whereas fundrise allows you to invest with little money passive investment — unlike owning your own commercial real estate outright fundrise investments are truly passive quarterly redemptions and distributions — the fundrise ereit has adopted a quarterly redemption plan to provide periodic liquidity however distributions are not guaranteed cons investment liquidity — fundrise ereits are not publicly traded once you make an investment you are pretty much committed to the investment for the term there is currently no secondary market to sell your investment to others however there is a quarterly redemption program whereby investors may be able to redeem their shares subject to some limitations tax consequences — distributions are taxed as ordinary income as opposed to the  tax rate on qualified dividends start real estate investing with as little as  summary real estate as an asset class is a longterm investment this includes reits whether they’re publicly traded nontraded or ereits the opportunities for capital appreciation portfolio diversification and regular distributions are alluring however distributions are never guaranteed while not exactly the same as investing in real estate directly reits are much more passive and allow you to invest in properties outside your geographic location fundrise can be a way to diversify into real estate without the large amounts of capital or management headaches involved when doing it yourself while i am a real estate investor reits have never appealed to me for several reasons — primarily because of the frontend load and ongoing fees fundrise takes the sting out of those investing fees with their  asset management fee and their unique accountability guarantee is a breath of fresh air in the investment marketplace every investor i know would fully agree with this statement on their website “today’s

want substantially reducing risk they will also give you a bonus if you do have k lying around and want to invest with them they also just launched iras from your investments with them finally i find the website easy to use the only drawback is that it isn’t open to all states but if your state allows it… it is a great site i only wish more would be started up this way roofstock seems to be a site

available for sale only on fundrises website not through brokers or exchanges by eliminating broker fees and distributing shares online fundrise will reduce the offerings costs and the savings of  to  percent of upfront expenses will be passed down to investors according to the filing by invoking regulation a fundrise avoids having to register the reit shares with the sec and allows nonaccredited investors access to the reit shares an accredited investor has either  million in net wealth excluding a primary residence or income of at least   for joint tax filers in each of the previous two years regulation a provides a safe harbor for companies to raise up to  million through the public issuance of nonregistered securities up to now real estate crowdfunding platforms could market to the
