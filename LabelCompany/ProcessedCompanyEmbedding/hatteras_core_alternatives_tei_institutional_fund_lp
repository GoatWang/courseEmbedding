fund quarterly review q  the hatteras core alternatives institutional fund lp the “fund” outperformed the benchmark as well as the broader equity markets by finishing the quarter slightly down the fund’s benchmark the hfrx global hedge fund index posted a  loss for the quarter the sp  tr index finished the quarter down  and global equities as measured by the msci world index sold off even further down  with heavy volatility throughout the quarter the fund’s private investment strategy bounced back significantly from a rather quiet first quarter to lead all of our strategies and return over  for the quarter josh e parrot caia hatteras funds  aug   private investments with an overall weighting of  and a positive  return the strategy contributed significantly to the fund’s overall performance the private strategy’s returns over the first quarter were relatively flat however the strategy rose with vigor over the spring months reporting a positive  in may after its positive  return in april the quarter’s positive performance illustrates the competitive edge of the private investment approach that not only incorporates higher return potential but also adds a much needed element of diversification away from the public markets the uplift in returns over the quarter resulted heavily from the strong performance in the private energy strategy due to the falling prices of natural gas and overall volatility of commodity markets many private energy funds have shifted their focus towards unconventional resource plays these emerging plays are tied to technological improvements in the oil and gas industry and have been a growth driver in domestic oil and gas production new and evolving technologies such as horizontal drilling d seismic and hydraulic fracturing have permitted oil and gas companies to access reserves of previously unrecoverable oil and natural gas the implementation of these unconventional resource projects is highly capital intensive and require management expertise to execute therefore these unconventional resource plays have presented an opportunity for private energy funds to fill a need where capital market funding is not readily available these opportunities have resulted in strong returns for our managers illustrating the agile and strategic nature of the private energy sector to opportunistically invest in areas that are not readily available in the public markets the other compelling characteristic of our private strategy has been its growing maturity in the fourth quarter of  quarterly distributions from underlying funds were larger than quarterly contributions to funds we have seen this trend continue into  as yeartodate distributions represented around  of capital contributions if this trend plays out and distributions continue to outweigh contributions cash previously used to fund capital calls can now be opportunistically deployed for liquidity needs or additional investments thus placing less capital needs on the portfolio from a cash standpoint the uptick in distributions is also an indicator that the investments are entering a prime period of their life cycle where valuations and exits could accelerate together we believe the current environment presents vast opportunities for private equity given public markets continue their volatility and capital market funding becomes less available with the growing maturity and ample diversification offered in the private asset portfolio we believe the impact of this strategy will continue to provide excess risk adjusted returns not available in a typical fund of hedge funds or traditional investment portfolio hedge fund strategies our hedge fund strategy was down  during the quarter and most of the losses can be attributed to our emerging market and energy themes these themes were two of our best performing positions during the first quarter but the ramifications of a global economic slowdown clearly hurt some of these higher beta exposures our tactical trading strategy helped offset the market volatility and dislocation during the quarter and ended as our best performing hedge fund strategy with a significant positive return opportunistic equity opportunistic equity is currently a  weight and was down just over  for the quarter due to emerging markets technology and energy exposures during the quarter we allocated to a new global longshort equity manager and we remain bullish on the long term potential of the emerging economies despite the recent price dislocations in particular we are emphasizing the emerging market consumer story and we continue to search for other hedged methods to implement this theme in addition our managers have been increasing their gross exposures in anticipation of a more fundamental stock picking environment this earnings season and we are especially bullish on longshort equity as a strategy in the nearterm as we believe quality will start to matter again enhanced fixed income enhanced fixed income at an  weight was down  for the quarter we continue to diversify away from enhanced fixed income and more into tactical trading and absolute return as better volatility mitigators as such we have been reducing our distressed debt exposure but we remain bullish on structured credit and rmbs in particular the recent rally in treasuries during the quarter created even more opportunities as spreads widened versus rmbs securities absolute return absolute return was down  for the quarter and is currently a  weight with the near term market uncertainty we allocated to two new absolute return funds during the quarter within our multistrategy and relative value substrategies we also reduced our event driven exposure within the strategy to further mitigate volatility our multistrategy managers continued to add positive returns for the quarter and have been the best performing funds for the strategy since last year tactical trading tactical trading which incorporates managed futures ctas global macro and tail risk strategies has a  weighting and was the best performing hedge fund strategy the strategy particularly proved its worth during the market dislocation in may and finished the quarter up nearly  despite a tumultuous june our discretionary cta’s and tail risk substrategies were the dominant drivers of performance within tactical trading and both finished with solid midsingle digit quarterly returns to help offset the overall volatility in the markets outlook we believe the second half of  will be much more volatile than the first half and we have positioned the hedge fund portfolio accordingly a lack of fiscal union in europe the pending fiscal cliff facing the us and the overall global economic slowdown could all provide challenging head winds our blend of hedge funds and private investments stood up well during the most volatile periods of the quarter and we believe the fund is well positioned to deliver unique benefits particularly from our private investment strategy whereas we are defensively positioned in the hedge fund portfolio the private investment strategy remains poised to capitalize on a number of exposures  an average age of over  years for the underlying private portfolio companies is a significant milestone as exit opportunities in private investments tend to begin in earnest in years three through five often these controloriented active management style investors are starting to unlock the value they’ve created since their original purchases  technology investments made not only in our venture capital funds but also through private energy are opening up new markets despite macro volatility  there is a gap between the public equity markets where values have doubled since march  and the significant discounts found in private equity companies this separation will persist but is starting to narrow as ma activity and ipos resume like they did in q  as always we appreciate

share of the net assets income expenses and the realized and unrealized gains losses of such feeder fund accordingly no federal state or local income taxes have been provided on profits of the feeder funds since the limited partners are individually liable for the taxes on their share of the feeder funds the feeder funds file tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which

considered prior to investment and should only be considered by persons financially able to maintain their investment and who can afford a loss of a substantial part or all of such investment the master fund intends to invest substantially all of its available capital in securities of private investment companies these investments will generally be restricted securities that are subject to substantial holding periods or are not traded in public markets at all so that the master fund may not be able to resell some of its adviser fund holdings for extended periods which may be several years limited partners should refer to the master funds financial statements included in this report along with the applicable feeder funds prospectus as supplemented and corresponding statement of additional information for a more complete list of risk factors no guarantee or representation is made that the feeder funds investment objective will be met   repurchase of limited partners units the board may from time to time and in its sole discretion cause the feeder funds to repurchase units from limited partners pursuant to written tenders by limited partners at such times and on such terms and conditions as established by the board in determining whether the feeder funds should offer to repurchase interests the board will consider among other things the recommendation of the investment managers the feeder funds generally expect to offer to repurchase units from limited partners on a quarterly basis as of march  june  september  and december  of each year in no event will more than  of the units of a feeder fund be repurchased per quarter the feeder funds do not intend to distribute to the limited partners any of the feeder funds income but generally expect to reinvest substantially all income and gains allocable to the limited partners a limited partner may therefore be allocated taxable income and gains and not receive any cash distribution units repurchased prior to the limited partners one year anniversary of its initial investment may be subject to a maximum  repurchase fee   indemnification in the normal course of business the feeder funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications the feeder funds maximum exposure under these agreements is dependent on future claims that may be made against the feeder funds and therefore cannot be established however based on experience the risk of loss from such claims is considered remote   financial highlights the financial highlights are intended to help an investor understand the feeder

master funds board the valuation procedures are implemented by the master funds investment managers and the third party administrator which report to the board for thirdparty information the master funds administrator monitors and reviews the methodologies of the various pricing services employed by the fund investments held by the master fund include •   investments in adviser funds  the master fund will value interests in the adviser funds at fair value using the net asset value nav as a practical expedient as provided by the investment managers of such adviser funds these adviser funds value their underlying investments in accordance with policies established by such advisor funds which ordinarily will be the value determined by their respective investment managers in accordance with the master funds valuation procedures investments in adviser funds are subject to the terms of the adviser funds offering documents valuations of the adviser funds may be subject to estimates and are net of management and performance incentive fees or allocations payable to the adviser funds investment managers as required by the adviser funds offering documents if the investment managers determine that the most recent value reported by any adviser fund does not represent fair value or if any adviser fund fails to report a value to the master fund a fair value determination is made under the master funds valuation procedures under the general supervision of the board because of the inherent uncertainty in valuation the estimated values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed and the differences could be material   the interests of some adviser funds primarily investments in private equity funds may be valued less frequently than the calculation of the master funds net asset value therefore the reported performance of the adviser fund may lag the reporting period of the master fund the investment managers

investments in exchange traded funds and mutual funds  securities traded on one or more of the us national securities exchanges or the otc bulletin board will be valued at their last sales price securities traded on nasdaq will be valued at the nasdaq official closing price nocp at the close of trading on the exchanges or markets where such securities are traded for the business day as of which such value is being determined •   investments in private companies  investments for which observable market prices in active markets do not exist are reported at fair value as determined in good faith by the adviser fair value is based on the best information available and is determined by reference to information including but not limited to the following projected sales net earnings earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda balance sheets public or private transactions valuations for publicly traded comparable companies recent round of financing in the companys stock andor other measures and consideration of any other pertinent information including the types of securities held and restrictions on disposition the amount determined to be fair value may incorporate the advisers own assumptions including appropriate risk adjustments for nonperformance and lack of marketability the methods used to estimate the fair value of private companies include  the market approach whereby fair value is derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or assets  eg multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company or asset such as projected revenue or ebitda by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions  adjusted by the adviser for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables and in some instances by reference to option pricing models or other similar methods  the income approach eg the discounted cash flow method and  cost for a period of time after an acquisition where such amount is determined by the adviser to be the best indicator of fair value these valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of judgment due to the absence of readily determinable fair values and the inherent uncertainty of valuations the estimated fair values for private companies may differ significantly from values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed and the differences could be material •   investments in options  options contracts give the master fund the right but not the obligation to buy or

fund was x the master fund classifies its assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value into three levels based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement estimated values may differ from the values that would have been used if a ready market existed or if the investments were liquidated at the valuation date the threetier hierarchy distinguishes between  inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and  inputs that reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes various inputs are used in determining the value of the master funds investments the inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below •  level   quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities •  level   other significant observable inputs or investments that can be fully redeemed at the net asset value in the near term including quoted prices for similar investments interest rates prepayment speeds credit risk ability to redeem in the near term generally within the next calendar quarter from adviser funds etc •  level   significant unobservable inputs including the master funds own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments or investments that cannot be fully redeemed at the net asset value in the near term these are investments that generally have one or more of the following
