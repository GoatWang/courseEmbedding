of shares of our common stock offered pursuant to this prospectus we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares being sold in this offering the selling stockholder will bear any underwriting commissions and discounts attributable to its sale of our common stock and we will bear the remaining expenses our industry is highly fragmented and we believe still nascent we believe that there are currently no national players that compete with us in the largescale highquality anticipatory compounding space in our therapeutic categories central admixture pharmacy services or caps a subsidiary of b braun medical offers a limited number of service lines that directly compete with us and has historically focused on total parenteral nutrition which is outside of our current service lines and represents a different business model based primarily on patientspecific compounding we believe the rest of the industry consists of fewer than eight regional competitors as well as numerous local players that primarily provide patientspecific compounding as of august    facilities have registered as an outsourcing facility under section b of the dqsa of the  registered facilities only  are registered as “steriletosterile” compounders and four of those  are our facilities we believe safety quality transparency demonstrated regulatory compliance and customization are the principal considerations for hospitals when choosing to outsource csps and selecting a provider of outsourced csps before the end of  we also faced significant price competition especially from low priced non“steriletosterile” compounders since the fungal meningitis outbreak in  which was caused by lowpriced “nonsteriletosterile” csps we believe that these other considerations have become much more important than price to our customers we believe our service offering is difficult to replicate for new entrants because section b outsourced compounding requires errorfree production and compliance with extensive and evolving regulations and increasing federal regulatory oversight in addition customer confidence and loyalty depend on an established track record of quality and patient safety in the future we could face additional competition from companies that do not currently engage in anticipatory compounding in the united states these potential competitors may include i pharmaceutical manufacturers that currently offer csps outside the united states but who are otherwise in the us health care market and may decide to expand their us service offerings to include csps ii pharmaceutical manufacturers that may expand their product offerings to include sterile intravenous admixture solutions and csps iii regional compounders who provide patientspecific compounding that decide to expand to anticipatory nonpatientspecific compounding and register as an outsourcing facility under the dqsa iv large hospitals and idns that may decide to develop onsite or shared facilities to selfsource anticipatory compounding and v new entrants attracted to the strong growth of our industry company description we are the leading national provider of outsourced compounded sterile preparations or csps to acute care hospitals in the united states sterile compounding is the process by which pharmaceuticals are combined or mixed to create a drug dosage therapy customized to meet specific hospital and physician clinical needs in formulations that are not otherwise commercially available our csps offer a strong value proposition to acute care hospitals by helping to address the growing need for greater operational efficiency enhanced patient safety and improved clinical outcomes we source sterile drugs diluents and containers only from manufacturers registered with the us food and drug administration or the fda and we compound only with fdaapproved or allowed drugs in finished dosage form and use only fdaapproved diluents and fdacleared containers utilizing these raw material components we prepare and provide a broad range of over  customized stock keeping units or skus to meet the individual requirements of our approximately  acute care hospital customers located across all  states our valueadded service offering has resulted in high customer retention rates which were in excess of  in each of the last three years we contract with each hospital customer directly and receive payments from them for our services accordingly we are not exposed to any direct reimbursement risk we believe that our proven ability to deliver “steriletosterile” csps consistently and reliably with a high degree of process and quality control is a key differentiator we utilize our four stateoftheart compounding facilities comprehensive standard operating procedures validated processes and systems and a highly trained workforce of pharmacists and certified pharmacy technicians to create csps in a readytouse form with enhanced safety labeling sterility assurance and extended expiration dating that often exceed what hospital pharmacies can accomplish on their own we believe that our csps provide a risk mitigation and cost management solution to our hospital customers while also improving the overall quality of care provided to patients for example we believe i our prefilled prelabeled csps reduce the risk of medication errors ii our extended expiration dating capabilities minimize drug waste and enhance work flow and iii our readytouse format improves clinician productivity as a result we believe that our services enhance overall operational efficiencies for our hospital customers we provide “mission critical” csps for most of the highest frequency procedures performed within acute care hospitals across several distinct therapy categories including pain management operating room anesthesia intensive care nerve block and labor and delivery we believe we are the established market leader for outsourced csps in these core therapy categories and estimate our capacity in these categories to be at least three times greater than that of our nearest competitor we also believe there are multiple opportunities to continue our growth including by expanding our relationships with our existing customers in our current service offerings introducing new service offerings within our existing therapy categories expanding into new therapy categories adding new hospital customers and expanding into new venues of care such as freestanding hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers which we refer to as alternate sites our company was founded in  through an asset acquisition from a large pharmaceutical and sterile solutions manufacturer at the time of the acquisition we acquired significant operational and managerial expertise in the hospital pharmacy admixture services industry over the years since we have significantly refined and improved our expertise in producing highquality csps at scale in accordance with applicable federal and state regulatory requirements and have developed a brand based on our commitment to safety and quality in our industry we have been registered with us drug enforcement administration or the dea since our inception in  voluntarily registered at that time as a manufacturer with the fda and were one of the first entities to voluntarily register with the fda as a section b large scale sterile compounding outsourcing facility following the passage of the us drug quality and security act or the dqsa we believe that increased oversight and regulation of csps by the fda and other federal and state agencies has increased the cost and complexity of hospitals continuing to provide sterile compounding services inhouse increased the incentive for them to outsource and as a result has reinforced our position in the industry as a trusted provider of outsourced csps we source approved drugs and diluents and cleared container components from a broad range of fdaregistered manufacturers and retain relationships with more than one source for a significant portion of our drug inputs to enhance continuity of supply for our customers we emphasize strategic relationships across the injectables supply chain keep abreast of regulatory and compliance requirements within our suppliers’ respective organizations and
