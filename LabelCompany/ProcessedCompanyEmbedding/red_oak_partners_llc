partners llc clarifies another misleading press release from dynacor jun    et from red oak partners llc agrees that shareholders have sent a powerful message  to the board new york june   prnewswire  dear fellow shareholders in an ongoing and much needed effort to promote transparency to fellow shareholders red oak partners llc red oak wishes to clarify yet another misleading and promotional press release issued by dynacor gold mines inc tsx dngotc dngdf dynacor or the company on june    specifically dynacors board has made incorrect claims about the level of support shown for its directors at the june  election  dynacors board is well aware that only two voting options exist in canada for the election of directors  for or withhold  there exists no against vote concept  accordingly withhold votes represent votes opposing reelection  despite knowing this dynacors board ignored a significant number of votes specifically marked as withhold regarding the reelection of its chairman as well as certain other directors  in yet another instance of misleading and cherrypicking of facts dynacors board has taken a path to skew information in its favor by promoting a fictitious level of support  we have confirmation that the withhold votes regarding the election of the nonindependent chairman rene branchaud represented an amount greater than eighty percent of all shares which voted at the  election and at least seventy times the number of shares which the eighteen year affiliated director owns personally  this is a far cry from the laughable  support which dynacors chairmanled board claimed was voted in support of its conflicted chairman branchaud  additionally because of red oaks concern about a fair election red oak voted on dynacors proxy card to ensure dynacor could not find ways to exclude such votes  despite taking such precautions dynacors board and representatives conducted the meeting in the absence of an independent inspector of elections  despite the dynacor insiders speaking english fluently they conducted the meeting entirely in french which was fine but did not ask in english for red oaks representative who was present at the meeting to propose red oaks nominees  a fairly run election would never have seen such a conflicted and intentionally unfair process and only confirms our concerns about dynacors chairman and boards alignment with shareholders and vs its desperation to entrench itself at literally any cost stated david sandberg red oaks founder and managing member red oaks goal was to bring important issues to light  we did not actively solicit shareholders and i did not make a single outbound call and we expect we spent less than  vs the shareholder monies which dynacors board so readily wasted dynacors board should publicly disclose what it spent even if shareholders will be outraged at the amount  ultimately we even voted on the companys proxy card  through this managed effort we were successful in confirming that the largest shareholders of the company expect significant change as a result of this process we forced dynacors board to publicly confirm it will address all of the issues we raised although it did recant in a recent press release regarding adopting policies related to director tenure but we will almost assuredly contest next years election in a significant way if tenure as well as tenurebased ownership requirements are not adopted and we gave a much needed wake up call to the board and to shareholders including those who have fiduciary duties to their own investors  in the interim we – along with all shareholders – anxiously await the governance committees new policies as well as the next nominating process one which we expect will not be led by the nonindependent chairman and in which shareholder candidates will be strongly considered if not favored  until then we ask that dynacors board require director training for its less experienced directors who have not had such training as well as those such as the ceo and some of the newer directors not named depatie whose only meaningful experience has been at dynacor and who therefore would not have exposure to public company governance and standard board processes    continued mr sandberg we remain excited about the business and continue to increase our investment and believe our group is currently the largest shareholder of the company  as longterm holders we continue to require strong governance and meaningful alignment and representation by shareholders because these are necessary to ensure that shareholders see optimal value and dodge a recurrence of the malaga bankruptcy dynacors predecessor which so many of these same insiders played a key role in regards david sandbergmanaging memberred

pipeda privacy policy website terms of service product license agreement  dun  bradstreet inc  all rights reserved red oak partners llc announces resignation of red oak’s designees from the board of directors of red oak partners llc announces resignation of red oaks designees from the board of directors of rf industries ltd mar  3 6 et from red oak partners llc new york march  3 prnewswire  red oak partners llc red oak today announced that its two designees entitled to serve as directors on the board of rf industries ltd rf nasdaq rfil david sandberg and j randall waterfield have resigned effective immediately and in accordance with the terms of the agreement reached between rf and red oak on august    under that agreement upon red oaks ownership falling below a threshold level as defined in the agreement its designees shall no longer be entitled to serve on rfs board of directors  after significant appreciation in rfs share price in recent months and largely via sales effected under a b plan red oaks current ownership level is now below the required threshold as defined in the agreement  although red oak has no influence over whether its second designee mr waterfield will resign or not mr waterfield has agreed to honor the agreement and resign effective immediately as well stated david sandberg red oaks founder and managing member rf has been a successful investment for red oak more than doubling over a sub two and onehalf year investment timeframe with such return excluding additional capital returned to shareholders via dividends and we recently proposed to the board and achieved a sharp increase in the regular quarterly dividend  red oak and rf initially established ownership terms in its  agreement to ensure directors had sufficient skin in the game  given mr waterfield and i no longer have the levels of share ownership which we believe directors of public companies should have in order to be aligned with shareholders best interests we are resigning effective immediately  despite my resignation i have offered to assist rf if requested to evaluate new directors to improve its governance policies towards making rf more shareholder friendly and to assist with certain strategic and other transition issues over the next few months all at no compensation  mr waterfield has indicated that he too is willing to assist the company on such matters upon request and at no compensation as well  continued mr sandberg the timing of our resignations allows rf to add other independent directors before the upcoming annual meeting  to optimize shareholder value going forward i strongly suggest that rfs board also add more independent directors noting that two independent directors worked at teledyne with rfs ceo and that such director nominees be referred by rfs large shareholders to ensure true independence adopt board rotation policies to ensure that fresh perspective exists and that current directors represent current shareholders ensure that current directors retain sufficient share ownership in correlation to their years of tenure ie the longer you serve the more you should own so as to be aligned with shareholders and retain at least the ownership levels defined in the august   agreement pursue formal and professional processes including regarding the evaluation of several candidates with requisite past cfo experience for the vacant cfo position and consider retaining a credible banker to oversee a strategic alternatives process which is something i believe all business should do periodically to ensure that shareholder value is optimized we believe rf has a strong niche and should continue to generate positive cash flows going forward  red oak wishes rf the best of luck going forward  its been a pleasure to serve as a director and to witness the dramatic recent growth and share appreciation david sandberg red oak partners llc   dsandbergredoakpartnerscom source red oak partners llc related links
