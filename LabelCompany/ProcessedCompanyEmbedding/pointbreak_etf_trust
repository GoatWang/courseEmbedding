extraordinary expenses if any and payments if any under rule b plan of the fund are limited to xx of average net assets after such date the expense limitation may be renewed terminated or revised by the adviser the adviser is permitted to recoup from the fund previously waived advisory fees or reimbursed expenses for three years from the fiscal year in which fees were waived or expenses reimbursed as long as such recoupment does not cause the funds operating expenses to exceed the expense cap that was        table of contents   applicable during the period in which the fees were

in the fund for the time periods indicated and then sell all of your shares at the end of those periods the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year and that the funds operating expenses remain the same this example does not include the brokerage commissions that investors may pay on their purchases and sales of fund shares although your actual costs may be higher

transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when the fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the

guideline link the adviser generally follows a replication strategy that is it invests substantially all of its investments and at least  in all of the securities comprising its underlying index in proportion to their weightings in the underlying index if it is not possible for the adviser to acquire component securities due to limited availability or regulatory restrictions the adviser may use a representative sampling indexing strategy to seek to track the underlying index instead of a full replication indexing strategy representative sampling is an indexing strategy meaning the fund generally will invest in a sample of securities in the index whose risk return and other characteristics resemble the risk return and other characteristics of the underlying index as a whole the fund may from time to time invest up to  of its total assets in securities other than component securities of the underlying index such as shortterm us treasuries treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less and money market instruments to the extent that the adviser believes such investments should help the funds overall portfolio track the underlying index concentration policy the fund will concentrate its investments ie invest  or more of the value of its total assets in securities of issuers in any one industry or sector only to the extent that the underlying index reflects a concentration in that industry or sector as of xx  the underlying index was concentrated in companies in the technology sector principal risks as with all funds a shareholder is subject to the risk that his or her investment could lose money the principal risks affecting shareholders investments in the fund are set forth below an investment in the fund       prospectus xxxx xx  table of contents is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the fdic or any government agency authorized participant concentration risk only an authorized participant as defined in the creations and redemptions section of the funds prospectus the prospectus may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the fund the fund has a limited number of institutions that act as authorized participants to the extent that these institutions exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation andor redemption orders with respect to the fund and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem creation units as defined below fund shares may trade at a discount to nav and possibly face trading halts andor delisting cash transaction risk the fund may effect creations and redemptions for cash rather than for inkind securities if the fund effects redemptions for cash rather than for inkind securities it may be required to sell portfolio securities in order to obtain the cash needed to distribute redemption proceeds which may decrease the tax efficiency of the fund compared to etfs that utilize an inkind redemption process to a greater extent consumer discretionary companies risk consumer discretionary companies are companies that provide nonessential goods and services such as retailers media companies and consumer services these companies manufacture products and provide discretionary services directly to the consumer and the success of these companies is tied closely to the performance of the overall domestic and international economy interest rates competition and consumer confidence success depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for the success of consumer discretionary products in the marketplace equity risk equity risk is the risk that the value of equity securities including common stocks may fall due to both changes in general economic conditions that impact the market as a whole as well as factors that directly relate to a specific company or its industry such general economic conditions include changes in interest rates periods of market turbulence or instability or general and prolonged periods of economic decline and cyclical change it is possible that a drop in the stock market may depress the price of most or all of the common stocks that the fund holds in addition equity risk includes the risk that investor        table of contents sentiment toward particular industries will become negative the value of a companys common stock may fall solely because of factors such as an increase in production costs that negatively impact other companies in the same region industry or sector of the market a companys common stock also may decline significantly in price over a short period of time due to factors specific to that company including decisions made by its management or lower demand for the companys products or services for example an adverse event such as an unfavorable earnings report or the failure to make anticipated dividend payments may depress the value of common stock geographic risk a natural or other disaster could occur causing an adverse impact on the fund and the companies to which it has exposure growth andor value stocks risk investing in value stocks involves the risk that the market will not recognize a securitys intrinsic value for a long time or that a security thought to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced when purchased investing in growth stocks involves the risk that will not experience faster than average growth as measured by revenues earnings or cash flow while growth stocks are expected to offer the potential for higher returns they also generally represent a greater risk when compared to value stocks growth stocks tend to do better than the overall market when stock prices in general are rising while underperforming the market as stock prices fall taking into account that past performance does not guarantee future results as a result investing in growth funds may require a slightly higher tolerance for risk as well as a longer time horizon indexrelated risk there is no guarantee that the fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the underlying index and therefore achieve its investment objective market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the funds ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the underlying index errors in the construction of the underlying index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the index provider for a period of time which may have an adverse impact on the fund industry concentration risk in followings its methodology the underlying index from time to time may be concentrated to a significant degree in securities of issuers located in a single industry or a sector to the extent that the underlying index concentrates in the securities of       prospectus xxxx xx  table of contents issuers in a particular industry or sector the fund will also concentrate its investments to approximately the same extent by concentrating its investments in an industry or sector the fund may face more risks than if it were diversified broadly over numerous industries or sectors such industrybased risks any of which may adversely affect the companies in which the fund invests may include but are not limited to the following general economic conditions or cyclical market patterns that could negatively affect supply and demand in a particular industry competition for resources adverse labor relations political or world events obsolescence of technologies and increased competition or new product introductions that may affect the profitability or viability of companies in an industry in addition at times such industry or sector may be out of favor and underperform other industries or the market as a whole internet companies risk internet companies are subject to rapid changes in technology worldwide competition rapid obsolescence of products and services loss of patent protections cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards frequent new product introductions and the considerable risk of owning small capitalization companies that have recently begun operations internet software and services sector risk competitive pressures such as technological developments fixedrate pricing and the ability to attract and retain skilled employees can significantly affect the internet software and services sectors changing domestic and international demand research and development costs availability and price components and product obsolescence also can affect profitability of companies in this sector issuer risk the funds performance depends on the performance of individual securities to which the fund has exposure any issuer of these securities may perform poorly causing the value of its securities to decline largecapitalization companies risk the fund may invest in largecap segments of the us stock market largecap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions during a period when largecap us stocks fall behind other types of investments  mid or smallcap stocks for instance  the funds largecap holdings could reduce performance          table of contents midcapitalization companies risk compared to largecapitalization companies midcapitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments and their securities may be more volatile and less liquid momentum and correlation risk the fund seeks to track the investment results of the solactive us internet index which is designed to track the performance of us listed companies i that are of small medium and large capitalization equities that represent companies in internetrelated businesses securities in the underlying index are weighted based on the total market value of their shares so that securities with higher total market values generally have a higher representation in the index accordingly although the funds investment strategy of investing in xx different companies provides a certain level of diversification because the selection of companies is based in part on their market capitalization which in turn reflects in part positive investment performance over a relatively short period the funds holdings may be weighted more heavily towards companies in industries or economic sectors that have outperformed other industries or sectors over the same period by way of example high tech stocks energy stocks and financial stocks have at times outperformed the general market there is no assurance that any industries or economic sectors that may be overweighted in the funds portfolio will continue to outperform the general market and to the extent they underperform the general market their concentration in the funds portfolio may adversely impact the funds performance  new fund risk there can be no assurance that the fund will grow or maintain an economically viable size if the fund does not reach an economically viable size the board of trustees of the fund could decide to liquidate the fund nondiversified fund risk because the fund is nondiversified and can invest a greater portion of its assets in stocks of individual issuers than a diversified fund changes in the market value of a single investment could cause greater fluctuations in share price than would occur in a diversified fund this may increase the funds volatility and cause the performance of a relatively small number of issuers to have a greater impact on the funds performance operational risk the fund is exposed to operational risk arising from a number of factors including but not limited to human error processing and communication errors errors of the funds service providers       prospectus xxxx xx  table of contents counterparties or other thirdparties failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures the fund seeks to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures however these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate for those risks that they are intended to address passive investment risk the fund is not actively managed and therefore will not sell a security due to current or projected underperformance of a security industry or sector unless that security is removed from the underlying index reliance on trading partners risk the fund invests in an economy that is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on the funds investments through its portfolio companies trading partners the fund is specifically exposed to us economic risk secondary market trading risk an investment in the fund faces numerous risks from its shares being traded in the secondary market including the potential lack of an active market for fund shares losses from trading in secondary markets periods of high volatility and disruption in the creationredemption process of the fund any of these factors among others may lead to the funds shares trading at a premium or discount to nav trading issues although fund shares are listed for trading on the bats global markets inc bats there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained trading in fund shares may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that in the view of the bats make trading in shares inadvisable there can be no assurance that the requirements of the bats necessary to maintain the listing of any fund will continue to be met or will remain unchanged or that the shares will trade with any volume or at all fluctuation of nav the nav of fund shares will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of the funds portfolio holdings the market prices of shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the funds nav and supply and demand of shares on the bats it cannot be predicted whether fund shares will trade below at or above their nav costs of buying or selling shares investors buying or selling fund shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage        table of contents commissions or other charges imposed by brokers as determined by that broker brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of shares smaller companies risk smaller companies in which the fund may invest may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger more established companies and may underperform other segments of the market or the equity market as a whole stock market risk the values of common stocks in the underlying index could decline generally or could underperform other investments tax risk to qualify for the favorable tax treatment generally available to regulated investment companies the fund must satisfy certain diversification requirements under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code in particular the fund generally may not acquire a security if as a result of the acquisition more than  or more of the value of the funds assets would be invested in a issuers in which the fund has in each case invested more than  of the funds assets and b issuers more than  of whose outstanding voting securities are owned by the fund when the underlying index is concentrated in a relatively small number of securities it may not be possible for the fund to fully implement a replication strategy while satisfying these diversification requirements the funds efforts to satisfy the diversification requirements may cause the funds return to deviate from that of the underlying index and the funds efforts to replicate the underlying index may cause it inadvertently to fail to satisfy the diversification requirements if the fund were to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company it would be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders would not be deductible by the fund in computing its taxable income telecommunications sector risk companies in the telecommunications sector may be affected by industry competition substantial capital requirements government regulation and obsolescence of telecommunications products and services due to technological advancement tracking error risk the funds return may not match or achieve a high degree of correlation with the return of the underlying index         prospectus xxxx xx  table of contents us economic risk the united states is a significant trading partner of or foreign investor in foreign markets and such economies may be particularly affected by changes in the us economy a decrease in us imports new trade regulations changes in the us dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the united states may have a material adverse effect on such foreign economy and as a result securities to which the fund has exposure valuation risk the sales price that the fund could receive for a security may differ from the funds valuation of the security and may differ from the value used by the underlying index particularly for securities or assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology in addition the value of the securities or other assets in the funds portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the funds shares performance information the fund is new and therefore does not have performance history once available the funds performance information will be

table of contents particularly where the underlying index is less commonly used therefore gains losses or costs associated with underlying index errors will generally be borne by the fund for example during a period where the underlying index contains incorrect constituents the fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the underlying indexs other constituents such errors may negatively or positively impact the fund any gains due to index provider errors will likely be kept by the fund and any losses resulting from index provider errors will likely be borne by the fund apart from scheduled rebalances the index provider may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the underlying index in order for example to correct an error in the selection of index constituents where the underlying index of the fund is rebalanced and the fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to correlate it to its underlying index any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the fund unscheduled rebalances to an underlying index may also expose the fund to tracking error risk which is the risk that the funds returns may not track those of the underlying index therefore errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the index provider to the underlying index may increase the costs and market exposure risk of the fund industrial sector risk the value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general the products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction government regulations world events economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims the industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices which may be influenced by unpredictable factors industry concentration risk in following its methodology the underlying index from time to time may be concentrated to a significant degree in securities of issuers located in a single industry or a sector to the extent that the underlying index concentrates in the securities of issuers in a particular industry or sector the fund will also concentrate its investments to approximately the same extent by concentrating its investments in an industry or sector the fund may face more risks than       prospectus xxxx xx  table of contents if it were diversified broadly over numerous industries or sectors such industrybased risks any of which may adversely affect the companies in which the fund invests may include but are not limited to the following general economic conditions or cyclical market patterns that could negatively affect supply and demand in a particular industry competition for resources adverse labor relations political or world events obsolescence of technologies and increased competition or new product introductions that may affect the profitability or viability of companies in an industry in addition at times such industry or sector may be out of favor and underperform other industries or the market as a whole information technology companies risk information technology companies are generally subject to the following risks rapidly changing technologies short product life cycles fierce competition aggressive pricing and reduced profit margins the loss of patent copyright and trademark protections cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions information technology companies may be smaller and less experienced companies with limited product lines markets or financial resources and few experienced management or marketing personnel information technology company stocks especially those which are internet related have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to their operating performance internet companies risk internet companies are subject to rapid changes in technology worldwide competition rapid obsolescence of products and services loss of patent protections cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards frequent new product introductions and the considerable risk of owning small capitalization companies that have recently begun operations internet software and services sector risk competitive pressures such as technological developments fixedrate pricing and the ability to attract and retain skilled employees can significantly affect the internet software and services sectors changing domestic and international demand research and development costs availability and price components and product obsolescence also can affect profitability of companies in this sector issuer risk the funds performance depends on the performance of individual securities to which the fund has exposure any issuer of these securities may perform poorly causing the value of its securities to        table of contents decline poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions competitive pressures changes in technology expiration of patent protection disruptions in supply labor problems or shortages corporate restructurings fraudulent disclosures or other factors issuers may in times of distress or at their own discretion decide to reduce or eliminate dividends which may also cause their stock prices to decline largecapitalization companies risk the fund may invest in the largecap segment of the us stock market largecap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions during a period when largecap us stocks fall behind other types of investments  bonds or smallcap stocks for instance  the funds performance also will lag those investments midcapitalization company risk investing in securities of midcapitalization companies involves greater risk than customarily is associated with investing in larger more established companies these companies securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies these securities may have returns that vary sometimes significantly from the overall securities market often midcapitalization companies and the industries in which they focus are still evolving and as a result they may be more sensitive to changing market conditions momentum and correlation risk the fund seeks to track the investment results of the solactive us internet index which is designed to track the performance of uslisted companies i that are of small medium and large capitalization equities that represent companies in internetrelated businesses securities in the underlying index are weighted based on the total market value of their shares so that securities with higher total market values generally have a higher representation in the index accordingly although the funds investment strategy of investing in  different companies provides a certain level of diversification because the selection of companies is based in part on their market capitalization which in turn reflects in part positive investment performance over a relatively short period the funds holdings may be weighted more heavily towards companies in industries or economic sectors that have outperformed other industries or sectors over the same period by way of example high tech stocks energy stocks and financial stocks have at times outperformed the general market there is no assurance that any industries or economic sectors that may be overweighted in the funds portfolio will continue to outperform the general market and to the extent they underperform the       prospectus xxxx xx  table of contents general market their concentration in the funds portfolio may adversely impact the funds performance new fund risk there can be no assurance that the fund will grow or maintain an economically viable size in which case it may experience greater tracking error than it otherwise would at higher asset levels or it could ultimately liquidate the fund may be liquidated at any time without shareholder approval and at a time that is not favorable for all of its shareholders shareholders will be provided  days advance notice of liquidation any liquidation will trigger income tax consequences to the funds shareholders nondiversified fund risk because the fund is nondiversified and can invest a greater portion of its assets in securities of individual issuers than a diversified fund changes in the market value of a single investment could cause greater fluctuations in share price than would occur in a diversified fund this may increase the funds volatility and cause the performance of a relatively small number of issuers to have a greater impact on the funds performance operational risk the fund is exposed to operational risk arising from a number of factors including but not limited to human error processing and communication errors errors of the funds service providers counterparties or other thirdparties failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures the fund seeks to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures however these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate for those risks that they are intended to address passive investment risk the fund is not actively managed therefore unless a specific security is removed from the funds underlying index the fund generally will not sell a security because the securitys issuer is in financial trouble if a specific security is removed from the underlying index the fund may be forced to sell such security at an inopportune time or for a price other than the securitys current market value an investment in the fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any equity securities traded on an exchange such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in security prices it is anticipated that the value of fund shares will decline more or less in correspondence with any decline in value of the underlying index the underlying index may not contain the appropriate mix of securities for any particular economic cycle and the timing of movements from one        table of contents type of security to another in seeking to replicate the underlying index could have a negative effect on the fund unlike with an actively managed fund the adviser does not use techniques or defensive strategies designed to lessen the effects of market volatility or to reduce the impact of periods of market decline this means that based on market and economic conditions the funds performance could be lower than other types of mutual funds that may actively shift their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or to lessen the impact of a market decline reliance on trading partners risk the fund invests in an economy that is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on the funds investments through its portfolio companies trading partners the fund is specifically exposed to us economic risk secondary market trading risk an investment in the fund faces numerous risks from its shares being traded in the secondary market including the potential lack of an active market for fund shares losses from trading in secondary markets periods of high volatility and disruption in the creationredemption process of the fund any of these factors among others may lead to the funds shares trading at a premium or discount to nav trading issues although fund shares are listed for trading on the bats there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained trading in fund shares may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that in the view of the bats make trading in shares inadvisable in addition trading in shares is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to bats circuit breaker rules there can be no assurance that the requirements of the bats necessary to maintain the listing of the fund will continue to be met or will remain unchanged or that the shares will trade with any volume or at all fluctuation of nav the nav of fund shares will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of the funds securities holdings the market prices of shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the funds nav and supply and demand of shares on the bats it cannot be predicted whether fund shares will trade below at or above their nav price differences may be due in large part to the fact that supply and       prospectus xxxx xx  table of contents demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares will be closely related to but not identical to the same forces influencing the prices of the securities of the underlying index trading individually or in the aggregate at any point in time the market prices of fund shares may deviate significantly from the nav of the shares during periods of market volatility however given that shares can be created and redeemed in creation units unlike shares of many closedend funds which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from and sometimes at premiums to their nav the adviser believes that large discounts or premiums to the nav of shares ought not to be sustained while the creationredemption feature is designed to make it likely that fund shares normally will trade close to the funds nav disruptions to creations and redemptions may result in trading prices that differ significantly from the funds nav if an investor purchases fund shares at a time when the market price is at a premium to the nav of the shares or sells at a time when the market price is at a discount to the nav of the shares then the investor may sustain losses costs of buying or selling shares investors buying or selling fund shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by brokers as determined by that broker brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of shares in addition secondary market investors will also incur the cost of the difference between the price that an investor is willing to pay for shares the bid price and the price at which an investor is willing to sell shares the ask price this difference in bid and ask prices is often referred to as the spread or bidask spread the bidask spread varies over time for shares based on trading volume and market liquidity and is generally lower if the funds shares have more trading volume and market liquidity and higher if the funds shares have little trading volume and market liquidity further increased market volatility may cause increased bidask spreads due to the costs of buying or selling shares including bidask spreads frequent trading of shares may significantly reduce investment results and an investment in shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments        table of contents smaller companies risk the fund may be composed primarily of or have significant exposure to securities of smaller companies as a result the fund may be subject to the risk that securities of smaller companies represented in the fund may underperform securities of larger companies or the equity market as a whole in addition in comparison to securities of companies with larger capitalizations securities of smallercapitalization companies may experience more price volatility greater spreads between their bid and ask prices significantly lower trading volumes and cyclical or static growth prospects smallercapitalization companies often have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may therefore be more vulnerable to adverse developments than larger capitalization companies these securities may or may not pay dividends stock market risk an investment in the fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any fund of equity securities such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices the values of equity securities could decline generally or could underperform other investments in addition securities may decline in value due to factors affecting a specific issuer market or securities markets generally tax risk to qualify for the favorable tax treatment generally available to regulated investment companies the fund must satisfy certain diversification requirements under the code in particular the fund generally may not acquire a security if as a result of the acquisition more than  of the value of the funds assets would be invested in a issuers in which the fund has in each case invested more than  of the funds assets and b issuers more than  of whose outstanding voting securities are owned by the fund when the underlying index is concentrated in a relatively small number of securities it may not be possible for the fund to fully implement a replication strategy or a representative sampling strategy while satisfying these diversification requirements therefore the funds return may deviate from that of its underlying index additionally if the components of the underlying index do not satisfy the diversification requirements and the funds efforts to replicate the underlying index may cause it inadvertently to fail to satisfy the diversification requirements       prospectus xxxx xx  table of contents if the fund could not or did not cure such failure it would cease to qualify for the special tax treatment accorded regulated investment companies under federal income tax law and the fund would be liable for federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rates on all of its income for that taxable year this would likely materially reduce the funds investment return technology sector risk technology companies including information technology companies face intense competition both domestically and internationally which may have an adverse effect on profit margins technology companies may have limited product lines markets financial resources andor personnel the products of technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments frequent new product introduction unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and other intellectual property rights the loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies the technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices which may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors telecommunications services sector risk the telecommunications services sector of an economy is often subject to extensive government regulation the costs of complying with governmental regulations delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies government actions around the world specifically in the area of premarketing clearance of products and prices can be arbitrary and unpredictable companies in the telecommunications sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition particularly in formulating new products and services using new technology technological innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete tracking error risk tracking error refers to the risk that the adviser may not be able to cause the funds performance to match or correlate to that of the underlying index either on a daily or aggregate basis there are a number of factors that may contribute to the funds tracking error such as fund expenses imperfect correlation between the funds investments and those of its underlying index rounding of share prices changes to the composition of the underlying index regulatory policies        table of contents and high portfolio turnover rate in addition mathematical compounding may prevent the fund from correlating with the monthly quarterly annual or other period performance of its underlying index tracking error may cause the funds performance to be less than expected us economic risk the united states is a significant trading partner of or foreign investor in foreign countries and such countries may be particularly affected by changes in the us economy a decrease in us imports new trade regulations changes in the us dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the united states may have a material adverse effect on foreign countries and as a result securities to which the fund has exposure valuation risk the sale price the fund could receive for a security or other asset may differ from the funds valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the underlying index particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology because nonus exchanges may be open on days when the fund does not price its shares the value of the securities or other assets in the funds portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the funds shares in addition for purposes of calculating the funds nav the value of assets denominated in nonus currencies is converted into us dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers this conversion may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the funds nav and the prices used by the underlying index which in turn could result in a difference between the funds performance and the performance of the underlying index a further discussion of other risks the fund may also be subject to certain other nonprincipal risks associated with its investments and investment strategies industrials sector risk the value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general the products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction government regulations world events economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and       prospectus xxxx xx  table of contents product liability claims the industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices which may be influenced by unpredictable factors companies in the industrials sector particularly aerospace and defense companies may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this sector rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and services tax product structure unlike interests in many conventional mutual funds the shares are traded throughout the day on a national securities exchange whereas mutual fund interests are typically only bought and sold at the closing nav the shares have been designed to be created and redeemed principally in kind in creation units at each days next calculated nav these arrangements are designed to protect ongoing shareholders from adverse effects on the funds portfolio that could arise from frequent cash creation and redemption transactions the fund reserves the right to accept cash creation and redemption baskets which would reduce tax efficiency in a conventional mutual fund redemptions can have an adverse tax impact on shareholders because of the mutual funds need to sell portfolio securities to obtain cash to meet fund redemptions these sales may generate taxable gains for the shareholders of the mutual fund whereas the inkind redemption mechanism utilized by most etfs including the fund generally will not lead to a taxable event for the fund or its shareholders portfolio holdings information about the funds daily portfolio holdings is available at wwwpointbreaketfscom in addition the fund discloses its complete portfolio holdings as

outstanding expenses and fees including management and distribution fees if any are accrued daily and taken into account for purposes of determining nav nav is determined each business day normally as of the close of regular trading of the bats ordinarily  pm eastern time when determining nav the value of the funds portfolio securities is based on market prices of the securities which generally means a valuation obtained from an exchange or other market or based on a price quotation or other equivalent indication of the value supplied by an exchange or other market or a valuation obtained from an independent pricing service if a securitys market price is not readily available or does not otherwise accurately reflect the fair value of the security the security will be valued by another method that the board believes will better reflect fair value in accordance with the trusts valuation policies and procedures fair value pricing may be used in a variety of circumstances including but not limited to situations when the value of a security in the funds portfolio has been materially affected by events occurring after the close of the market on which the security is principally traded but prior to the close of the bats such as in the case of a corporate action or other news that may materially affect the price of a security or trading in a security has been suspended or halted accordingly the funds nav may reflect certain portfolio securities fair values rather than their market prices          table of contents fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that a fair value determination for a security will materially differ from the value that could be realized upon the sale of the security in addition fair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the funds nav and the prices used by the underlying index this may result in a difference between the funds performance and the performance of the

cause any of the harmful effects noted above that may result from frequent cash trades moreover the fund imposes transaction fees on inkind purchases and redemptions of creation units to cover the custodial and other costs incurred by the fund in effecting inkind trades these fees increase if an investor substitutes cash in part or in whole for creation units reflecting the fact

calculates and maintains its own proprietary indices and serves as the calculation agent for thirdparty indices changes to the index methodology the index is governed by a published rulesbased

addition the index provider has established policies and procedures designed to prevent nonpublic information about pending changes to the index from being used or disseminated in an improper manner continuous offering the method by which creation unit aggregations of shares are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws because new creation unit aggregations of shares are issued and sold by the fund on an ongoing basis at any point a distribution as such term is used in the securities act may occur brokerdealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may depending on the circumstances result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the securities act for example a brokerdealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes creation unit aggregations after placing an order with the distributor breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares a determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the securities act must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the brokerdealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter brokerdealer firms should also note that dealers who are not underwriters but are effecting transactions in shares whether or not participating in the distribution of shares generally are required to deliver a prospectus this is because the prospectus delivery exemption in section a of the securities act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of section d of the  act firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the fund are reminded that pursuant to rule  under the securities act a prospectus delivery obligation under section b of the securities act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the exchange is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available at the exchange upon request the prospectus delivery mechanism provided in rule  is only available with respect to transactions on an exchange portfolio holdings policy on disclosure of portfolio holdings the board of trustees of the trust the board has adopted a policy on disclosure of portfolio holdings which it believes is in the best interest of the funds shareholders the policy is designed to i protect the confidentiality of the funds nonpublic portfolio holdings information ii prevent the selective disclosure of such information and iii ensure

secondary market information with respect to the funds portfolio holdings is also disseminated daily on the funds website the distributor may also make available portfolio holdings information to other institutional market participants and entities that provide information services this information typically reflects the funds anticipated holdings on the following    table of contents business day authorized participants are generally large institutional investors that have been authorized by the distributor to purchase and redeem large blocks of shares known as creation units pursuant to legal requirements including the exemptive order granted by the sec through which the fund offers and redeems shares other than portfolio holdings information made available in connection with the creationredemption process as discussed above portfolio holdings information that is not filed with the sec or posted on the publicly available website may be provided to third parties only in limited circumstances as described above disclosure to providers of auditing custody proxy voting and other similar services for the fund as well as rating and ranking organizations will generally

policy including as to any changes to the policies and procedures that have been made or recommendations for future changes the board is responsible for approving or ratifying any amendment to this policy additional information about investment objectives policies and related risks the funds investment objective and principal investment strategies are described in the prospectus the following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the prospectus for a description of certain permitted investments see description of permitted investments in this sai nondiversification the fund is classified as a nondiversified investment company under the  act a nondiversified classification means that the fund is not limited by the  act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer this means that the fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a small number of issuers than a diversified fund the securities of a particular issuer or a small number of issuers may constitute a greater portion of the underlying index and therefore the securities may constitute a greater portion of the funds portfolio this may have an adverse effect on the funds performance or subject the funds shares to greater price volatility than more diversified investment companies moreover in pursuing its objective the fund may hold the securities of a single issuer in an amount exceeding  of the market value of the outstanding securities of the issuer subject to restrictions imposed by the internal revenue code of  as amended the code in particular as the funds size grows and its assets increase it will be more likely to hold more than  of the securities of a single issuer if the issuer has a relatively small public float as compared to other components in its underlying index borrowing although the fund does not intend to borrow money the fund may do so to the extent permitted by the  act under the  act the fund may borrow up to onethird  of its net assets the fund will borrow money only for shortterm or emergency purposes such borrowing is not for investment purposes and will be repaid by the borrowing fund promptly borrowing will tend to exaggerate the effect on net asset value nav of any increase or decrease in the market value of the funds portfolio money borrowed will be subject to interest costs that may or may not be recovered by earnings on the securities purchased the fund also may be required to maintain minimum average balances in connection with a borrowing or to pay a commitment or other fee to maintain a line of credit either of these requirements would increase the cost of borrowing over the stated interest rate    table of contents description of permitted investments the following are descriptions of the permitted investments and investment practices and the associated risk factors the fund will only invest in any of the following instruments or engage in any of the following investment practices if such investment or activity is consistent with the funds investment objective and permitted by the funds stated investment policies equity securities equity securities represent ownership interests in a company and include common stocks preferred stocks warrants to acquire common stock and securities convertible into common stock investments in equity securities in general are subject to market risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate over time fluctuations in the value of equity securities in which the fund invests will cause the net asset value of the fund to fluctuate types of equity securities common stocks  common stocks represent units of ownership in a company common stocks usually carry voting rights and earn dividends unlike preferred stocks which are described below dividends on common stocks are not fixed but are declared at the discretion of the companys board of directors preferred stocks  preferred stocks are also units of ownership in a company preferred stocks normally have preference over common stock in the payment of dividends and the liquidation of the company however in all other respects preferred stocks are subordinated to the liabilities of the issuer unlike common stocks preferred stocks are generally not entitled to vote on corporate matters types of preferred stocks include adjustablerate preferred stock fixed dividend preferred stock perpetual preferred stock and sinking fund preferred stock generally the market values of preferred stock with a fixed dividend rate and no conversion element varies inversely with interest rates and perceived credit risk convertible securities  convertible securities are securities that may be exchanged for converted into or exercised to acquire a predetermined number of shares of the issuers common stock at the funds option during a specified time period such as convertible preferred stocks convertible debentures and warrants a convertible security is generally a fixed income security that is senior to common stock in an issuers capital structure but is usually subordinated to similar nonconvertible securities in exchange for the conversion feature many corporations will pay a lower rate of interest on convertible securities than debt securities of the same corporation in general the market value of a convertible security is at least the higher of its investment value ie its value as a fixed income security or its conversion value ie its value upon conversion into its underlying common stock convertible securities are subject to the same risks as similar securities without the convertible feature the price of a convertible security is more volatile during times of steady interest rates than other types of debt securities the price of a convertible security tends to increase as the market value of the underlying stock rises whereas it tends to decrease as the market value of the underlying common stock declines rights and warrants  a right is a privilege granted to existing shareholders of a corporation to subscribe to shares of a new issue of common stock before it is issued rights normally have a short life of usually two to four weeks are freely transferable and entitle the holder to buy the new common stock at a lower price than the public offering price warrants are securities that are usually issued together with a debt security or preferred stock and that give the holder the right to buy proportionate amount of common stock at a specified price warrants are freely transferable and are traded on major exchanges unlike rights warrants normally have a life that is measured in years and entitles the holder to buy common stock of a company at a price that is usually higher than the market price at the time the warrant is issued corporations often issue warrants to make the accompanying debt security more attractive    table of contents an investment in warrants and rights may entail greater risks than certain other types of investments generally rights and warrants do not carry the right to receive dividends or exercise voting rights with respect to the underlying securities and they do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuer in addition their value does not necessarily change with the value of the underlying securities and they cease to have value if they are not exercised on or before their expiration date investing in rights and warrants increases the potential profit or loss to be realized from the investment as compared with investing the same amount in the underlying securities risks of investing in equity securities general risks of investing in stocks  while investing in stocks allows investors to participate in the benefits of owning a company such investors must accept the risks of ownership unlike bondholders who have preference to a companys earnings and cash flow preferred stockholders followed by common stockholders in order of priority are entitled only to the residual amount after a company meets its other obligations for this reason the value of a companys stock will usually react more strongly to actual or perceived changes in the companys financial condition or prospects than its debt obligations stockholders of a company that fares poorly can lose money stock markets tend to move in cycles with short or extended periods of rising and falling stock prices the value of a companys stock may fall because of        factors that directly relate to that company such as decisions made by its management or lower demand for the companys products or services        factors affecting an entire industry such as increases in production costs and        changes in general financial market conditions that are relatively unrelated to the company or its industry such as changes in interest rates currency exchange rates or inflation rates because preferred stock is generally junior to debt securities and other obligations of the issuer deterioration in the credit quality of the issuer will cause greater changes in the value of a preferred stock than in a more senior debt security with similar stated yield characteristics small and mediumsized companies  investors in small and mediumsized companies typically take on greater risk and price volatility than they would by investing in larger more established companies this increased risk may be due to the greater business risks of their small or medium size limited markets and financial resources narrow product lines and frequent lack of management depth the securities of small and mediumsized companies are often traded in the overthecounter market and might not be traded in volumes typical of securities traded on a national securities exchange thus the securities of small and medium capitalization companies are likely to be less liquid and subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than securities of larger more established companies whenissued securities  a whenissued security is one whose terms are available and for which a market exists but which have not been issued when the fund engages in whenissued transactions it relies on the other party to consummate the sale if the other party fails to complete the sale the fund may miss the opportunity to obtain the security at a favorable price or yield when purchasing a security on a whenissued basis the fund assumes the rights and risks of ownership of the security including the risk of price and yield changes at the time of settlement the market value of the security may be more or less than the purchase price the yield available in the market when the delivery takes place also may be higher than those obtained in the transaction itself because the fund does not pay for the security until the delivery date these risks are in addition to the risks associated with its other investments decisions to enter into whenissued transactions will be considered on a casebycase basis when necessary to maintain continuity in a companys index membership the fund will segregate cash or liquid securities equal in value to commitments for the whenissued transactions the fund will segregate additional liquid assets daily so that the value of such assets is equal to the amount of the commitments    table of contents real estate investment trusts reits a reit is a corporation or business trust that would otherwise be taxed as a corporation that meets the definitional requirements of the code the code permits a qualifying reit to deduct from taxable income the dividends paid thereby effectively eliminating corporate level federal income tax and making the reit a passthrough vehicle for federal income tax purposes to meet the definitional requirements of the code a reit must among other things invest substantially all of its assets in interests in real estate including mortgages and other reits cash and government securities derive most of its income from rents from real property or interest on loans secured by mortgages on real property and distribute annually  or more of its otherwise taxable income to shareholders reits are sometimes informally characterized as equity reits and mortgage reits an equity reit invests primarily in the fee ownership or leasehold ownership of land and buildings a mortgage reit invests primarily in mortgages on real property which may secure construction development or longterm loans reits may be affected by changes in underlying real estate values which may have an exaggerated effect to the extent that reits in which the fund invests may concentrate investments in particular geographic regions or property types additionally rising interest rates may cause investors in reits to demand a higher annual yield from future distributions which may in turn decrease market prices for equity securities issued by reits rising interest rates also generally increase the costs of obtaining financing which could cause the value of the funds investments to decline during periods of declining interest rates certain mortgage reits may hold mortgages that the mortgagors elect to prepay which prepayment may diminish the yield on securities issued by such mortgage reits in addition mortgage reits may be affected by the ability of borrowers to repay when due the debt extended by the reit and equity reits may be affected by the ability of tenants to pay rent certain reits have relatively small market capitalization which may tend to increase the volatility of the market price of securities issued by such reits furthermore reits are dependent upon specialized management skills have limited diversification and are therefore subject to risks inherent in operating and financing a limited number of projects by investing in reits indirectly through the fund a shareholder will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of the fund but also indirectly similar expenses of the reits reits depend generally on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions to shareholders in addition to these risks equity reits may be affected by changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trusts while mortgage reits may be affected by the quality of any credit extended further equity and mortgage reits are dependent upon management skills and generally may not be diversified equity and mortgage reits are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers and selfliquidation in addition equity and mortgage reits could possibly fail to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the code or to maintain their exemptions from registration under the  act the above factors may also adversely affect a borrowers or a lessees ability to meet its obligations to the reit in the event of default by a borrower or lessee the reit may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or lessor and may incur substantial costs associated with protecting its investments us government securities the fund may invest in us government securities securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or its agencies or instrumentalities include us treasury securities which are backed by the full faith and credit of the us treasury and which differ only in their interest rates maturities and times of issuance us treasury bills have initial maturities of oneyear or less us treasury notes have initial maturities of one to ten years and us treasury bonds generally have initial maturities of greater than ten years certain us government securities are issued or guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities of the us government including but not limited to obligations of us government agencies or instrumentalities such as fannie mae the government national mortgage association ginnie mae the small business administration the federal farm credit administration the federal home loan banks banks for cooperatives including the central bank for cooperatives the federal land banks the federal intermediate credit banks the tennessee valley authority the exportimport bank of the united states the commodity credit corporation the federal financing bank the national credit union administration and the federal agricultural mortgage corporation farmer mac    table of contents some obligations issued or guaranteed by us government agencies and instrumentalities including for example ginnie mae passthrough certificates are supported by the full faith and credit of the us treasury other obligations issued by or guaranteed by federal agencies such as those securities issued by fannie mae are supported by the discretionary authority of the us government to purchase certain obligations of the federal agency while other obligations issued by or guaranteed by federal agencies such as those of the federal home loan banks are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury while the us government provides financial support to such us governmentsponsored federal agencies no assurance can be given that the us government will always do so since the us government is not so obligated by law us treasury notes and bonds typically pay coupon interest semiannually and repay the principal at maturity on september   the us treasury announced a federal takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac placing the two federal instrumentalities in conservatorship under the takeover the us treasury agreed to acquire  billion of senior preferred stock of each instrumentality and obtained warrants for the purchase of common stock of each instrumentality the senior preferred stock purchase agreement or agreement under the agreement the us treasury pledged to provide up to  billion per instrumentality as needed including the contribution of cash capital to the instrumentalities in the event their liabilities exceed their assets this was intended to ensure that the instrumentalities maintain a positive net worth and meet their financial obligations preventing mandatory triggering of receivership on december   the us treasury announced that it was amending the agreement to allow the  billion cap on the us treasurys funding commitment to increase as necessary to accommodate any cumulative reduction in net worth until  for the period during which these agreements were in effect the investments of holders including the fund of mortgagebacked securities and other obligations issued by fannie mae and freddie mac are protected fannie mae and freddie mac remained in conservatorship as of december          us treasury obligations us treasury obligations consist of bills notes and bonds issued by the us treasury and separately traded interest and principal component parts of such obligations that are transferable through the federal bookentry system known as separately traded registered interest and principal securities strips and treasury receipts trs        receipts interests in separately traded interest and principal component parts of us government obligations that are issued by banks or brokerage firms and are created by depositing us government obligations into a special account at a custodian bank the custodian holds the interest and principal payments for the benefit of the registered owners of the certificates or receipts the custodian arranges for the issuance of the certificates or receipts evidencing ownership and maintains the register trs and strips are interests in accounts sponsored by the us treasury receipts are sold as zero coupon securities        us government zero coupon securities strips and receipts are sold as zero coupon securities that is fixed income securities that have been stripped of their unmatured interest coupons zero coupon securities are sold at a usually substantial discount and redeemed at face value at their maturity date without interim cash payments of interest or principal the amount of this discount is accreted over the life of the security and the accretion constitutes the income earned on the security for both accounting and tax purposes because of these features the market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that have similar maturity but that pay interest periodically zero coupon securities are likely to respond to a greater degree to interest rate changes than are nonzero coupon securities with similar maturity and credit qualities    table of contents      us government agencies some obligations issued or guaranteed by agencies of the us government are supported by the full faith and credit of the us treasury others are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury while still others are supported only by the credit of the instrumentality guarantees of principal by agencies or instrumentalities of the us government may be a guarantee of payment at the maturity of the obligation so that in the event of a default prior to maturity there might not be a market and thus no means of realizing on the obligation prior to maturity guarantees as to the timely payment of principal and interest do not extend to the value or yield of these securities nor to the value of the funds shares other shortterm instruments the fund may invest in shortterm instruments including shortterm treasuries and money market instruments on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons money market instruments are generally shortterm investments that may include but are not limited to i shares of money market funds ii obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities including governmentsponsored enterprises iii negotiable certificates of deposit cds bankers acceptances fixed time deposits and other obligations of us and foreign banks including foreign branches and similar institutions iv commercial paper rated at the date of purchase prime by moodys or a by sp or if unrated of comparable quality as determined by the adviser v nonconvertible corporate debt securities eg bonds and debentures with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than  days and that satisfy the rating requirements set forth in rule a under the  act and vi shortterm us dollardenominated obligations of foreign banks including us branches that in the opinion of the adviser are of comparable quality to obligations of us banks which may be purchased by the fund any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or a forwardsettled basis money market instruments also include shares of money market funds time deposits are nonnegotiable deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates bankers acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers usually in connection with international transactions investment companies the fund may invest in the securities of other investment

short sale is against the box if at all times during which the short position is open the fund owns at least an equal amount of the securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable without

sold short uncovered short sales are transactions under which the fund sells a security it does not own to complete such a transaction the fund must borrow the security to make delivery to the buyer the fund then is obligated to replace the security borrowed by purchasing the security at the market price at the time of the replacement the price at such time may be more or less than the price at which the security was sold by the fund until the security is replaced the fund is required to pay the lender amounts equal to any dividends or interest that accrue during the period of the loan to borrow the security the fund also may be required to pay a premium which would increase the cost of the security sold the proceeds of the short sale will be retained by the broker to the extent necessary to meet margin requirements until the short position is closed out until the fund closes its short position or replaces the borrowed security the fund may a segregate cash or liquid securities at such a level that i the amount segregated plus the amount deposited with the broker as collateral will equal the current value of the security sold short and ii the amount segregated plus the amount deposited with the broker as collateral will not be less than the market value of the security at the time the security was sold short or b  otherwise cover the funds short position

shareholder approval while the trustees have no present intention of exercising this power they may do so if any fund fails to reach a viable size within a reasonable amount of time or for such other reasons as may be determined by the board brokerage transactions the policy of the trust regarding purchases and sales of securities for the fund is that primary consideration will be given to obtaining the most favorable prices and efficient executions of transactions consistent with this policy when securities transactions are effected on a stock exchange the trusts policy is to pay commissions which are considered fair and reasonable without necessarily determining that the lowest possible commissions are paid in all circumstances the trust believes that a requirement always to seek the lowest possible commission cost could impede effective portfolio management and preclude the fund and the adviser from obtaining a high quality of brokerage and research services in seeking to determine the reasonableness of brokerage commissions paid in any transaction the adviser will rely upon its experience and knowledge regarding commissions generally charged by various brokers and on its judgment in evaluating the brokerage services received from the broker effecting the transaction such determinations are necessarily subjective and imprecise as    table of contents in most cases an exact dollar value for those services is not ascertainable the trust has adopted policies and procedures that prohibit the consideration of sales of the funds shares as a factor in the selection of a broker or dealer to execute its portfolio transactions the adviser owes a fiduciary duty to its clients to seek to provide best execution on trades effected in selecting a brokerdealer for each specific transaction the adviser chooses the brokerdealer deemed most capable of providing the services necessary to obtain the most favorable execution best execution is generally understood to mean the most favorable cost or net proceeds reasonably obtainable under the circumstances the full range of brokerage services applicable to a particular transaction may be considered when making this judgment which may include but is not limited to liquidity price commission timing aggregated trades capable floor brokers or traders competent block trading coverage ability to position capital strength and stability reliable and accurate communications and settlement processing use of automation knowledge of other buyers or sellers arbitrage skills administrative ability underwriting and provision of information on a particular security or market in which the transaction is to occur the specific criteria will vary depending upon the nature of the transaction the market in which it is executed and the extent to which it is possible to select from among multiple brokerdealers the adviser will also use electronic crossing networks ecns when appropriate the adviser does not currently use the funds assets for or participate in any third party soft dollar arrangements although it may receive proprietary research from various full service brokers the cost of which is bundled with the cost of the brokers execution services the adviser does not pay up for the value of any such proprietary research the adviser is responsible subject to oversight by the adviser and the board for placing orders on behalf of the fund for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities if purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the fund and one or more other investment companies or clients supervised by the adviser are considered at or about the same time transactions in such securities are allocated among the several investment companies and clients in a manner deemed equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to all by the adviser in some cases this procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the security so far as the fund is concerned however in other cases it is possible that the ability to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower brokerage commissions will be beneficial to the fund the primary consideration is prompt execution of orders at the most favorable net price the fund may deal with affiliates in principal transactions to the extent permitted by exemptive order or applicable rule or regulation brokerage with fund affiliates the fund may execute brokerage or other agency transactions through registered brokerdealer affiliates of the fund the adviser or the distributor for a commission in conformity with the  act the  act and rules promulgated by the sec these rules require that commissions paid to the affiliate by the fund for exchange transactions not exceed usual and customary brokerage commissions the rules define usual and customary commissions to include amounts which are reasonable and fair compared to the commission fee or other remuneration received or to be received by other brokers in connection with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased or sold on a securities exchange during a comparable period of time the trustees including those who are not interested persons of the fund have adopted procedures for evaluating the reasonableness of commissions paid to affiliates and review these procedures periodically securities of regular brokerdealer the fund is required to identify any securities of its regular brokers and dealers as such term is defined in the  act which it may hold at the close of its most recent fiscal year regular brokers or dealers of the trust are the ten brokers or dealers that during the most recent fiscal year i received the greatest dollar amounts of brokerage commissions from the trusts portfolio transactions ii engaged as principal in the largest dollar amounts of portfolio transactions of the trust or iii sold the largest dollar amounts of the trusts shares the fund is new and has no securities of regular broker dealers to report portfolio turnover rate portfolio turnover may vary from year to year as well as within a year high turnover rates are likely to result in comparatively greater brokerage expenses the overall reasonableness of brokerage commissions is evaluated by the adviser based upon its knowledge of available information

purchasing creation units directly from the fund because the funds shares may be issued on an ongoing basis a distribution of shares could be occurring at any time certain activities that a shareholder performs as a dealer could depending on the circumstances result in the shareholder being deemed a participant in the distribution in a manner that could render the shareholder a statutory underwriter and subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the securities act for example a shareholder could be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases creation units from the fund breaks them down into the constituent shares and sells those shares directly to customers or if a shareholder chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondarymarket demand for shares whether a person is an underwriter depends upon all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to that persons activities and the examples mentioned here should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could cause you to be deemed an underwriter dealers who are not underwriters but are participating in a distribution as opposed to engaging in ordinary secondarymarket transactions and thus dealing with the funds shares as part of an unsold allotment within the meaning of section c of the

asset value next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the fund through the distributor and only on a business day except upon liquidation of the fund the trust will not redeem shares in amounts less than creation units investors must accumulate enough shares in the secondary market to constitute a creation unit in order to have such shares redeemed by the trust there

set forth in the participant agreement the redemption request shall be rejected the authorized participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the trust to the distributor in accordance with procedures set forth in the participant agreement investors should be aware that their particular broker may not have executed a participant agreement and that therefore requests to redeem creation units may have to be placed by the investors broker through an authorized participant who has executed a participant agreement investors making a redemption request should be aware

suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to the fund  for any period during which the exchange is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings  for any period during which trading on the exchange is suspended or restricted  for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the shares of the fund or determination of the nav of the shares is not reasonably practicable or  in such other circumstance as is permitted by the sec required early acceptance of orders notwithstanding the foregoing as described in the participant agreement andor applicable order form the fund may require orders to be placed up to one or more business days prior to the trade date as described in the participant agreement or the applicable order form in order to receive the trade dates net asset value authorized participants may be notified that the cutoff time for an order may be earlier on a particular business day as described in the participant agreement and the order form determination of net asset value net asset value per share for the fund is computed by dividing the value of the net assets of the fund ie the value of its total assets less total liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding rounded to the nearest cent expenses and fees including the management fees are accrued daily and taken into account for purposes of determining net asset value the net asset value of the fund is calculated by the custodian and determined at the close of the regular trading session on the bats ordinarily  pm eastern time on each day that such exchange is open provided that fixedincome assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixedincome instruments on any day that the securities industry and financial markets association sifma announces an early closing time in calculating the funds net asset value per share the funds investments are generally valued using market valuations a market valuation generally means a valuation i obtained from an exchange a pricing service or a major market maker or dealer ii based on a price quotation or other equivalent indication of value supplied by an exchange a pricing service or a major market maker or dealer or iii based on amortized cost in the case of shares of other funds that are not traded on an exchange a market valuation means such funds published net asset value per share the adviser may use various pricing services or discontinue the use of any pricing service as approved by the board from time to time a price obtained from a pricing service based on such pricing services valuation matrix may be considered a market valuation any assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are converted into us dollars at the current market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more sources in the event that current market valuations are not readily available or such valuations do not reflect current market value the trusts procedures require the valuation committee to determine a securitys fair value if a market price is not readily available in determining such value the valuation committee may consider among other things i price comparisons among multiple sources ii a review of corporate actions and news events and iii a review of relevant financial indicators eg movement in interest rates market indices and prices from the funds index provider in these cases the funds net asset value may reflect certain portfolio securities fair values rather than their market prices fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value determination for a security is materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of the security in addition fair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the funds net asset value and the prices used by the funds underlying index this may result in a difference between the funds performance and the performance of the funds underlying index dividends and distributions the following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the section in the prospectus entitled dividends distributions and taxes general policies dividends from net investment income if any are declared and paid quarterly by the fund distributions of net realized securities gains if any generally are declared and paid once a year but the fund may make distributions on a more frequent basis for the fund to improve index tracking or to comply with the distribution requirements of the code in all events in a manner consistent with the provisions of the  act    table of contents dividends and other distributions on shares are distributed as described below on a pro rata basis to beneficial owners of such shares dividend payments are made through dtc participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received from the fund the fund may make additional distributions to the extent necessary i to distribute the entire annual taxable income of the fund plus any net capital gains and ii to avoid imposition of the excise tax imposed by section  of the code management of the trust reserves the right to declare special dividends if in its reasonable discretion such action is necessary or advisable to preserve the status of the fund as a regulated investment company ric or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income dividend reinvestment service the trust will not make the dtc bookentry dividend reinvestment service available for use by beneficial owners for reinvestment of their cash proceeds but certain individual brokerdealers may make available the dtc bookentry dividend reinvestment service for use by beneficial owners of the fund through dtc participants for reinvestment of their dividend distributions investors should contact their brokers to ascertain the availability and description of these services beneficial owners should be aware that each broker may require investors to adhere to specific procedures and timetables in order to participate in the dividend reinvestment service and investors should ascertain from their brokers such necessary details if this service is available and used dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares issued by the trust of the fund at nav per share distributions reinvested in additional shares of the fund will nevertheless be taxable to beneficial owners acquiring such additional shares to the same extent as if such distributions had been received in cash federal income taxes the following is only a summary of certain additional federal income tax considerations generally affecting the fund and its shareholders no attempt is made to present a comprehensive explanation of the federal state local or foreign tax treatment of the fund or its shareholders and the discussion here and in the prospectus is not intended to be a substitute for careful tax planning the following general discussion of certain federal income tax consequences is based on provisions of the code and the regulations issued thereunder as in effect on the date of this sai new legislation as well as administrative changes or court decisions may significantly change the conclusions expressed herein and may have a retroactive effect with respect to the transactions contemplated herein shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the application of the provisions of tax law described in this sai in light of the particular tax situations of the shareholders and regarding specific questions as to federal state or local taxes regulated investment company ric status the fund will seek to qualify for treatment as a ric under the code provided that for each tax year the fund i meets the requirements to be treated as a ric as discussed below and ii distributes at least an amount equal to the sum of  of the funds net investment income for such year including for this purpose the excess of net realized shortterm capital gains over net longterm capital losses and  of its net taxexempt interest income the fund itself will not be subject to federal income taxes to the extent the funds net investment income and the funds net realized capital gains if any are distributed to the funds shareholders one of several requirements for ric qualification is that the fund must receive at least  of the funds gross income each year from dividends interest payments with respect to certain securities loans gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to the funds business of investing in stock securities foreign currencies and net income from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership the  test a second requirement for qualification as a ric is that the fund must diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the funds taxable year a at least  of the market value of the funds total assets is represented by cash and cash items us government securities securities of other rics and other securities with these other securities limited in respect to any one issuer to an amount not greater than  of the value of the funds total assets or  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and b not more than  of the value of its total assets are invested in the securities other than us government securities or securities of other rics of any one issuer the securities other than securities of other rics of two or more issuers which the fund controls and which are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships the asset test    table of contents under the asset test the fund generally may not acquire a security if as a result of the acquisition more than  of the value of the funds assets would be invested in a issuers in which the fund has in each case invested more than  of the funds assets and b issuers more than  of whose outstanding voting securities are owned by the fund because the underlying index has a relatively small number of constituents the  limitation could affect the funds ability to effectively implement a replication strategy or a representative sampling strategy as the fund grows the  limitation might also affect its ability to effectively implement a replication strategy or a representative sampling strategy if the fund fails to satisfy the  test or the asset test the fund may be eligible for relief provisions if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid with respect to each failure to satisfy the applicable requirements additionally relief is provided for certain de minimis failures of the asset test in order to qualify for relief provisions for a failure to meet the asset test the fund may be required to dispose of certain assets if the fund fails to qualify for treatment as a ric for any year and the relief provisions are not available all of its taxable income will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders in such case its shareholders would be taxed as if they received ordinary dividends although the dividends could be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders and the dividends may be eligible for the lower tax rates available to noncorporate shareholders on qualified dividend income to requalify for treatment as a ric in a subsequent taxable year the fund would be required to satisfy the ric qualification requirements for that year and to distribute any earnings and profits from any taxable year for which the fund failed to qualify for tax treatment as a ric if the fund failed to qualify as a ric for a period greater than two taxable years the fund would generally be required to pay a fundlevel tax on any net builtin gains recognized with respect to certain of its assets upon a disposition of such assets within ten years of qualifying as a ric in a subsequent year the board reserves the right not to maintain the qualification of the fund for treatment as a ric if it determines such course of action to be beneficial to shareholders if the fund determines that it will not qualify for treatment as a ric the fund will establish procedures to reflect the anticipated tax liability in the funds nav the fund may elect to treat part or all of any qualified late year loss as if it had been incurred in the succeeding taxable year in determining the funds taxable income net capital gain net shortterm capital gain and earnings and profits a qualified late year loss generally includes net capital loss net longterm capital loss or net shortterm capital loss incurred after october  of the current taxable year and certain other lateyear losses if the fund has a net capital loss that is capital losses in excess of capital gains for a taxable year the excess of the funds net shortterm capital losses over its net longterm capital gains is treated as a shortterm capital loss arising on the first day of the funds next taxable year and the excess if any of the funds net longterm capital losses over its net shortterm capital gains is treated as a longterm capital loss arising on the first day of the funds next taxable year the fund will generally be subject to a nondeductible  federal excise tax to the extent it fails to distribute by the end of any calendar year at least the sum of  of its ordinary income for the year  of its capital gain net income for the oneyear period ending on october  of that year and certain other amounts the fund intends to make sufficient distributions or deemed distributions to avoid imposition of the excise tax but can make no assurances that all such tax liability will be eliminated the fund intends to distribute substantially all its net investment income and net realized capital gains to shareholders at least annually the distribution of net investment income and net realized capital gains generally will be taxable to fund shareholders regardless of whether the shareholder elects to receive these distributions in cash or in additional shares however the fund may determine not to distribute or determine to defer the distribution of some portion of its income in nonroutine circumstances if the fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net longterm capital gains in excess of its net shortterm capital losses including any capital loss carryovers it will be subject to a corporate tax on the amount retained in that event the fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who a will be required to include in income for us federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gains their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount b will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the income tax paid by the fund on the undistributed amount against their us federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities if any and c will be entitled to increase their tax basis for us federal income tax purposes in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount of undistributed net capital gain included in their respective income over their respective income tax credits organizations or persons not subject to us federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund of their pro rata share of such taxes paid by the fund upon timely filing appropriate returns or claims for refund with the internal revenue service the irs    table of contents a portion of the net investment income distributions of the fund may be treated as qualified dividend income which for noncorporate shareholders is generally eligible for taxation at reduced rates the portion of distributions that the fund may report as qualified dividend income is generally limited to the amount of qualified dividend income received by the fund but if for any fund taxable year  or more of the funds gross income exclusive of net capital gain from sales of stocks and securities consists of qualified dividend income all distributions of such income for that taxable year may be reported as qualified dividend income qualified dividend income is in general dividend income from taxable domestic corporations and certain foreign corporations ie foreign corporations incorporated in a possession of the united states or in certain countries with a comprehensive tax treaty with the united states and other foreign corporations if the stock with respect to which the dividend income is paid is readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states in order for some portion of the dividends received by a shareholder to be qualified dividend income the fund must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to the dividend paying stocks in its portfolio and the shareholder must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to the funds shares distributions reported to fund shareholders as capital gain dividends will be taxable at the rates applicable to longterm capital gains for taxable years beginning on or before december   at a maximum rate of  for noncorporate shareholders regardless of how long the shareholder has owned the shares the funds shareholders will be notified annually by the fund as to the federal tax status of all distributions made by the fund distributions may be subject to state and local taxes us individuals with income exceeding   if married and filing jointly are subject to an additional  medicare contribution tax on their net investment income including interest dividends and capital gains including capital gains realized on the sale or exchange of shares of the fund this  tax also applies to all or a portion of the undistributed net investment income of certain shareholders that are estates and trusts shareholders who have held fund shares for less than a full year should be aware that the fund may report and distribute as ordinary dividends or capital gain dividends a percentage of income that is not equal to the percentage of the funds total ordinary income or net capital gain respectively actually earned during the period of investment in the fund if the funds distributions for a taxable year exceed its taxable income and capital gains realized during a taxable year all or a portion of the distributions made for the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders a return of capital distribution will generally not be taxable but will reduce each shareholders cost basis in the fund and generally result in a higher reported capital gain or lower reported capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold a sale or exchange of shares in the fund may give rise to a capital gain or loss in general any capital gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares will be treated as longterm capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than  months otherwise the capital gain or loss on the taxable disposition of shares will be treated as shortterm capital gain or loss any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares held for six months or less will be treated as longterm rather than shortterm to the extent of any longterm capital gain distributions received or deemed received by the shareholder with respect to the shares all or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares will be disallowed if substantially identical shares are purchased through reinvestment of dividends or otherwise within  days before or after the disposition in such a case the basis of the newly purchased shares will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss an authorized participant who exchanges securities for creation units generally will recognize a gain or a loss the gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the market value of the creation units at the time and the sum of the exchangers aggregate basis in the securities surrendered plus the amount of cash paid for such creation units a person who redeems creation units will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the exchangers basis in the creation units and the sum of the aggregate market value of any securities received plus the amount of any cash received for such creation units the irs however may assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of securities for creation units cannot be deducted currently under the rules governing wash sales or on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic position any capital gain or loss realized upon the creation of creation units will generally be treated as longterm capital gain or loss if the securities exchanged for such creation units have been held for more than one year any capital gain or loss realized upon the redemption of creation units will generally be treated as longterm capital gain or loss if the shares comprising the creation units have been held for more than one year otherwise such capital gains or losses will be treated as shortterm capital gains or losses    table of contents the trust on behalf of the fund has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the trust if the purchaser or group of purchasers would upon obtaining the shares so ordered own  or more of the outstanding shares of the fund and if pursuant to section  of the code the fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit the trust also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the  determination the trust reserves the absolute right to reject an order for creation units if acceptance of the securities to be exchanged for the creation units would have certain adverse tax consequences to the fund persons purchasing or redeeming creation units should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax treatment of any creation or redemption transaction foreign investments income received by the fund from sources within foreign countries including for example dividends or interest on stock or securities of nonus issuers may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by such countries tax treaties between such countries and the us may reduce or eliminate such taxes in some cases if as of the end of the funds taxable year more than  of the value of the funds assets consist of the securities of foreign corporations the fund may elect to permit shareholders who are us citizens resident aliens or us corporations to claim a foreign tax credit or deduction but not both on their income tax returns for their pro rata portions of qualified taxes paid by the fund during that taxable year to foreign countries in respect of foreign securities the fund has held for at least the minimum period specified in the code in such a case shareholders will include in gross income from foreign sources their pro rata shares of such taxes a shareholders ability to claim a foreign tax credit or deduction in respect of foreign taxes paid by the fund may be subject to certain limitations imposed by the code which may result in the shareholder not getting a full credit or deduction for the amount of such taxes shareholders who do not itemize on their federal income tax returns may claim a credit but not a deduction for such foreign taxes backup withholding the fund or your broker will be required to withhold as backup withholding on taxable dividends paid to any shareholder as well as the proceeds of any redemptions of creation units paid to a shareholder or authorized participant who  fails to provide a correct taxpayer identification number certified under penalty of perjury  is subject to withholding by the irs for failure to properly report all payments of interest or dividends  fails to provide a certified statement that he or she is not subject to backup withholding or  fails to provide a certified statement that he or she is a us person including a us resident alien the backup withholding rate is currently  backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld may be credited against the shareholders ultimate us tax liability foreign shareholders foreign shareholders ie nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations partnerships trusts and estates are generally subject to us withholding tax at the rate of  or a lower tax treaty rate on distributions derived from net investment income and shortterm capital gains gains from the sale or other disposition of shares of the fund generally are not subject to us taxation unless the recipient is an individual who either  meets the codes definition of resident alien or  is physically present in the us for  days or more per year different tax consequences may result if the foreign shareholder is engaged in a trade or business within the united states in addition the tax consequences to a foreign shareholder entitled to claim the benefits of a tax treaty may be different than those described above ordinary dividends redemption payments and certain capital gain dividends paid after june   or in certain cases after later dates to a shareholder that is a foreign financial institution as defined in section  of the code and that does not meet the requirements imposed on foreign financial institutions by section  will generally be subject to withholding tax at a  rate under current irs guidance withholding on such payments began or will begin at different times depending on the type of payment the type of payee and whether the shareholders account is opened before or after july   withholding with respect to ordinary dividends began on july   for accounts opened on or after that date and on certain later dates for accounts opened before july   withholding on redemption payments and certain capital gain dividends is currently scheduled to begin on january   the extent if any to which such withholding tax may be reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty is unclear a nonus shareholder may be exempt from the withholding described in this paragraph under an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the us and a foreign government provided that the shareholder and the applicable foreign government comply with the terms of such agreement in order for a foreign investor to qualify for an exemption from backup withholding the foreign investor must comply with special certification and filing requirements foreign investors in the fund should consult their tax advisors in this regard    table of contents tax shelter reporting regulations under us treasury regulations if a shareholder recognizes a loss of  million or more for an individual shareholder or  million or more for a corporate shareholder the shareholder must file with the irs a disclosure statement on form  direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement but under current guidance shareholders of a ric are not excepted the fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayers treatment of the loss is proper shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances other issues the fund may be subject to tax or taxes in certain states where the fund does business furthermore in those states which have income tax laws the tax treatment of the fund and of fund shareholders with respect to distributions by
