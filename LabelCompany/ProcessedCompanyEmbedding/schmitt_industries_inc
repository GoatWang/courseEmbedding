schmitt industries inc incorporated on december   designs manufactures and sells test and measurement products for two main business segments the balancer segment and the measurement segment the company operates through two segments the design and assembly of dynamic balancing systems and components for the machine tool industry balancer and the design and assembly of laserbased test and measurement systems measurement for the balancer segment the company designs manufactures and sells computercontrolled vibration detection balancing and process control systems for the machine tool industry across the world particularly for grinding machines under the measurement segment the company through its subsidiary schmitt measurement systems inc designs manufactures and sells laser and white light sensors for distance dimensional and area measurement for a range of commercial applications laserbased microroughness measurement products for the semiconductor wafer and hard disk drive industries and for other industrial applications laserbased surface analysis and measurement products for a range of scientific applications and ultrasonic measurement products that measure the fill levels of tanks holding propane diesel and other tankbased liquids and transmit that data via satellite to a secure website for displaythe company operates in geographic markets including the united states europe and asia it also provides sales and service for europe and asia through its subsidiary schmitt europe limited sel located in coventry england and through its sales representative office located in shanghai chinabalancer segmentthe companys principal product line for this segment is the schmitt dynamic balance system sbs which consists of a vibration sensor a computer control unit and a balance head that is placed either externally on the grinding wheel spindle with the use of a spindle mounted adaptor or internally inside the spindle bore the sb control panel contains up to approximately four slots for additional circuit boards designed for specific functions such as manual balancing balancing using hydro chambers and process monitoring which involves the detection and analysis of high frequency noise known as acoustic emission ae generated by the grinding process customers can also detect and analyze the ae signal generated during grinding or wheel dressing to help monitor and manage the grinding process customers include both end user operators as well as manufacturers of grinding machines for a range of industries that utilize the grinding process including the automotive industrial aerospace and medical industriesthe sb also includes an optional acoustic emission monitoring system aems control card which uses acoustic sensor technology to monitor the ae signal generated on the grinding machine during key events in the grinding process the aems card allows grinding wheel infeed right up to the point of initial contact of the grinding wheel with a new part loaded in the machine the system can automatically detect the initial contact and report this event to the machine control stopping the wheel infeed without operator intervention the sb also offers two process control cards that fit inside the control panel to provide control of the grinding process the exactcontrol card and the exactdress card the exactcontrol process control card offers multifunctional grinding process control capability by detecting and analyzing either the ae signal pattern or the machine power fluctuations and then using one of seven process control strategies to adjust and optimize the grinding process based on that signal data additional sbs products include the sb and the ae the sb is a manual balancing system offering both one and two plane manual balancing capabilities the system comes in a machine installation version sb and a portable version sbpthe company competes with marposs spa mpm micro prazision marx gmbh and balance systems

industries inc about schmitt  schmitt industries inc schmitt industries inc  about schmitt about schmitt about schmitt industries inc schmitt industries designs manufactures and markets highly precise test measurement and process control systems for a wide variety of applications the company was founded in  after determining that there was no simple or reliable solution for inprocess dynamic balancing of precision grinding machines precision grinding is a necessary step for nearly every manufacturing process the company’s sbs dynamic balancing systems can detect and dynamically correct vibration as low as  microns to ensure product quality sbs acoustic emission sensors help grinding machine operators maximize the efficiency of the grinding process thereby increasing part throughput and lowering operating costs the company’s family of products continued to grow in the early ’s with the acquisition of the acuity™ line of dimensional and distance measurement lasers these laser products utilize both triangulation and timeofflight measurement principles and are known for their speed and accuracy the acuity products are used in a wide variety of industrial commercial and research applications in  the company purchased xact™ ultrasonic measurement technology for the remote monitoring of the fill levels of propane and other liquid tanks the xact system sends a “ping” through the tank wall and then detects the echo this timeofflight data along with other information such as tank size and configuration is used to calculate the fill level and that data is transmitted by satellite to a secure website for display typical users are bulk propane diesel jet fuel suppliers and ammonia users and distributors today schmitt industries is one of the world leaders in
