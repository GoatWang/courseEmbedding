limited liability company if you want to start a business forming a limited liability company — or llc — could be a great choice llcs are designed to be simple and inexpensive to setup and are easy to run they have many of the advantages of larger businesses and corporations without all of the rules regulations and legal compliance commonly found with other business entities llcs are registered with the government in your state advantages of an llc llcs have many benefits for businesses especially small businesses and startups llcs are quick and easy — the paperwork involved in setting up an llc is simple to complete and you can complete the whole process fast an llc limits your “personal liability” — that means any liabilities your business has debts obligations and other liabilities belong to it alone typically even as the business owner you will not be liable for your llcs obligations llcs are easy to maintain — you don’t need to hold annual general meetings assign boards of directors or meet particularly onerous rules and regulations flexibility and control over the llc — llcs are easy to manage — you can add and amend members and make other changes without too much paperwork llc taxes are simple — any income earned by your llc “flows through” to your personal tax return and is taxed as normal members report any profits or losses from the llc on their personal tax returns this can keep your accounting costs down you won’t be “double taxed” — some corporations have to pay tax on their profits and then individuals pay tax again when they receive stock dividends llc members are not subject to this double taxation how to setup your new llc business there are six easy steps you need to take when setting up an llc  name your llc first you’ll need to create an original name for your new business this should be something distinctive that wouldn’t be confused with the name of another business or llc you will need to include a “designator” in the name of your business to show it’s an llc this is normally through including a suffix of “llc” or “limited company” for example blue widget manufacturing llc or bob baker and sons limited company if youre looking for help with searching for your llc name to see if its taken weve put together how to search  choose your business entity name in all  states  provide the address for your new llc each llc will need to have a designated business address if you’re running a company from home this can be the same as your home address if you’re renting office space it can be where your office is located if you have multiple locations it would be the address where your “head office” is this will vary as some states will permit a po box  assign a registered agent for your llc every llc must have a registered agent for small llcs this is generally the same person as the managing director or owner for small llcs this is generally the same person as the managing director or owner the member — or owner — of an llc can also serve as the registered agent but some members will prefer to assign those responsibilities to another individual or company the registered agent is simply the person who receives official legal and tax correspondence all of our online business formation packages include a “registered agent” service free for the first year and  per year thereafter  provide the names and addresses of llc members the llc members are typically the people who own and run the business they are also the ones who can take profits out of the business to pay themselves most states require you to list the names and addresses of all members when you register the llc you can register these addresses as street addresses or po boxes  state the purpose of your llc some states require you to explain the purpose of your company this does not limit you to engaging solely in that type of business — its fine to expand into new areas later on  file the articles of organization once youve gathered all the information together for your llc you’ll need to file formal documents with your state agency we can do this on your behalf for more information on the steps you need to follow when starting your llc see incfiles help center post on steps to starting a limited liability company llc who can form an llc most people in good legal standing are able to form an llc you should consider creating an llc if you want to limit your personal liability and personal exposure forming an llc protects your personal assets from any claims or debts your business has against it it’s important to note that not all businesses can operate as llcs for example businesses dealing with banking or insurance are typically prevented from forming as an llc there are also restrictions from state to state for example california prevents some types of professionals from starting llcs to learn more about the specific regulations in your state when starting your llc check out incfiles complete llc state information where to form an llc generally speaking if you plan to conduct business in your home state it makes sense to form your llc there although there can be some advantages to forming an llc in delaware nevada or other “business friendly” states in most cases those benefits won’t apply to your llc additionally you will need to file as a “foreign llc” if you conduct business in other states so if for example you incorporate in delaware and then conduct business in north carolina you’d have to file and pay fees to the nc government when to form an llc the best time to form

the membersowners in the case of a single member llc it is taxed the same as a sole proprietorship ie typically filed on the schedule c of the owners personal income tax filing in the case of a multi member member it is taxed the same as a partnership ie a  partnership return is filed with the irs with a schedule k being supplied to each partnermember showing the proportional profitloss allocated to them with this being filed on the schedule c or e note these are general tax explanations and may not apply to everyone you should confer with the appropriate accountingtax specialists to make sure you understand your personal tax liability what is the management structure of an llc an llc is typically managed by its membersowners referred to as membermanaged in that respect an llc is unlike a corporation which has a much more rigid and defined management structure including directors and officers all owners of the llc are typically referred to as members and they can have control and voting interest proportional to their ownership interest or in proportions different from their ownership interest however the members agree are nonus residents allowed to own a corporation of llc there are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a c corporation or an llc the s corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders owner but any us citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder owner you would of course require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process known as the registered agent address but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a c corporation or an llc can i form an llc with just one member there was a time when almost every state required the llc to have two or more members but that is no longer the case this important change came in response to revised irs regulations that clearly permitted singlemember llcs as a result in most states if you plan to be the sole owner of a business and you wish to limit your personal liability you can choose between forming a corporation or an llc what is an operating agreement the operating agreement is akin to a partnership agreement for a general partnership or limited liability partnership llp it is an internal contract amongst the membersowners of the llc and it lays out such things as ownership interest member responsibilities accounting method adding or removing members terms for concluding the llc etc it is generally not required by a given state for forming an llc with the exception of new york although it is certainly recommended when dealing with private companies for financing issues loans mortgages etc it may be required by that company a customizable operating agreement is included with the llccorp kit can another business entity be a member of an llc in the majority of states the members of an llc can be individuals corporations or other llcs these members of the llc can be out of state residents or even foreign nationals furthermore there is no limit to the amount of members that an llc can have the flexibility of an llc in contrast to an s corporation is stark considering the s corporations are limited to  shareholders who must either be united states citizens or lawful permanent residents questions visit the help center or get in

contact dashboard login incorporate now why thousands of small business owners choose incfile scroll down deciding on a company formation service can be very confusing and seemingly overwhelming process there are a multitude of companies on the web that perform the function of starting new entities and each has its own unique offerings and packages that can potentially you make feel that they are comparing apples to oranges although our modesty prohibits us from claiming that we are the best listed below are some of the distinguishing features that we think separate us from other companies  value – nobody gives you more for less  more first and foremost our basic price of a new entity formation is  plus state filing fees and although you may find companies claiming to do it for less you have to be aware that many of these companies only prepare the documents and mail them to you our service is end to end we prepare your documents file them with the state and only deliver everything to you only after the company has been filed and if for any reason we cannot get your filed we will issue a full refund to you less  registered agent service  st year free  more each of our  packages include a  free year of registered agent service if you do not need us to act as your registered agent you are not obliged to do so and you can name yourself or whomever you wish after the first year you have the option to renew the registered agent service for the annual price of  we do not ever under any circumstance charge your payment card automatically if you decide to renew you will need to enter the site and process the renewal with your payment information we only point this out because there are companies that will offer the registered agent service for a pre specified time lets say  weeks or  months and then auto charge your payment card for whatever there annual fee is and then keep charging every year thereafter going forward making the assumption that the company is still active or that you have not changed the agent on file with the state less  transparency  more we have dedicated much time and effort to make sure that you know exactly what not only the final cost of your formation will be throughout the order process but we also make sure that you are aware of any additional post filing fees that the state may require of you after the formation is complete on the first page of our order process you will see a link at the towards the top of the page that will present itself after the state and entity type have been selected titled state compulsory filing requirements we strongly urge you to review this link as many states ie nevada exercise very expensive fees that are due within a close proximity to the entity being filed the link will also inform you what the annual fees and requirements for keeping the company active will be as most states require the entity to file document known as an annual report or franchise tax we will let you know when it is due and what it will cost less  notifications  more all of our packages include lifetime notification alerts as long as we have a valid email we will also send email alerts informing our clients of important filing dates regarding their entities these emails are sent on a schedule that will allow you to know when an annual report or franchise tax report is due so that you can avoid missing important filing dates less  internal documents  more it is very important that clients understand that the company formation process is more than just filing the articles of organization  incorporation with the state depending on the state in which the company is filed some states may not list the members of an llc or the directors and shareholders of a corporation we create custom operating agreements for the lllc which will list the name and percentage of ownership for each member in addition we also create custom bylaws and organizational meeting minutes for corporations which list the names of the directors and shareholders as well as the number of shares that each shareholder owns the internal documents stated above are in addition to other custom documents as well such as the statement of the organizer  incorporator and banking resolutions if changes need to be made to any of these documents we can also provide them to our clients in digital format so that they can be customized as needed less  electronic copies  more we know that sometimes even the best organized person can misplace or lose important documents therefore we make sure to keep copies of every filing in digital format should you need it in the future less  privacy  more you can always rest assured that your personal information will remain such we do not sell or solicit your information to any person or outside business the only we will share any of your personal information with any outside agency is through the receipt of a subpoena although we do have partners that we encourage our clients to use they will only be provided your contact information if you personally opt in we also do not store any payment card information in our database and scrape any other sensitive information from our site ie social security numbers from the database as soon as the order is completed less  sales practices  more we do not employ sales people any person that you speak to on the telephone regarding information about a new formation will always be knowledgable long time employee or on of the owners of the company we only provide you with clear concise information that will allow you to make the best decision for your needs even though it is much more profitable for us we never have or will encourage our clients to form entities in states outside of the location where the business is physically located as this practice adds further complexity to the process if additional steps are not taken and can leave the client exposed in the event of litigation or the pursuance of additional licensing in the state of location we would strongly urge you to be wary of companies that compel you to form a business entity in this state or that state as this can have detrimental consequences if the additional steps are not taken follow the link for more information regarding this less  experience  more when we entered this industry in  the landscape of competitors was completely different from the companies we see today through hard work and determination we weathered the incremental business cycles that all business are subject to and are still here today we have formed well over  companies and the majority of our staff has been with us since the beginning of the companies existence what that means for you is that you can rest assured that your documents will be handled by individuals who have vast knowledge and experience in filing business entities and are familiar with the nuances of each of the  states less  humility  more at the end of the day we know that we are not perfect we make mistakes sometimes its difficult to reach us on the phones and speak to a live person however if we do make a an error or fall short of expectations you can rest assured that we will do everything within in reason to ensure that you leave a satisfied customer and have a positive experience our goal is to provide to provide the most value at the lowest cost and the cost for that is that we cannot staff a pleather of call takers to man the phones if you do need to reach us immediately the best way to contact us for a prompt response is to use the messaging tool found at
