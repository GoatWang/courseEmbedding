stock is being promoted by only one elite penny stock group websitethis will end badly like all the past promotions done by this grouptotal of  warrants to acquire common shares at golden edge entertainment otcpkgdee is a name that i believe is currently the target of a penny stock promotion scheme it is my view that the stocks intrinsic value is somewhere near  and it is with conviction that i recommend that any investors currently in the name sell the entirety of their stake immediately i believe that golden edge entertainment is a stock definitely worth shorting my track record of identifying and publicly exposing such highly overvalued equities is excellent little revenue debts no business bright future as is usually the case with these types of hypedup scams it takes only one quick glance at the balance sheet to realize that the m market capitalization that this equity commands is beyond ludicrous with  in total current assets and  in current liabilities in the recent quarter it is clear the company is not going in the right direction i find it difficult to believe that gdee can make any moves in the right direction it really cant and its my suspicion that the purpose of this company is not to succeed but to sell stock the recent volume is due to overly bullish promotional mailers a picture of gdee chart you can see that trading in golden edge entertainment started seeing really big volumes on august   this is when people received an email promotion from one of the elite penny group websites this group is currently promoting the ticker aren you can read my report about that on going stock promotion here what i also find funny is this stock has not traded any volume in the longest time but friday  shares traded to me that looks like someone bought knowing monday that there would be a stock promotion that would be illegal email campaign mysoaringpennystockscom is the only one from the elite penny stock group to send out emails on gdee i believe this is a one and done stock promotion and will not be a long term promotion this means the insiders will be dumping hard very soon you can see that the mysoaringpennystockscom website is part of the elite group by seeing that they were sending out amlh emails with the rest of the sites now the group is sending emails out emails on aren amlh emails from group aren emails from group disclaimer you can see that obviously someone is interested in increasing public awareness for golden edge entertainment  most likely whoever owns those  warrants that can be converted into common shares at  per share why else would someone spend up to  to increase public awareness at these levels those are worth millions of dollars it is worth it to them because if they can bring in buyers and liquidate their shares around these prices that can mean millions in profits running pumpanddump schemes is a lucrative business and that is why we see it way too often my job is to alert you elite penny group websites elitepennystockcom pennystockscom elitespennystockcom bestamericanstockscom finestpennystockscom mysoaringpennystockscom only one that sent out gdee promo my feeling is this is a one and done stock promotion elite penny group history glenmark capital corp otcpkglrkf disclosed budget  shares outstanding promotion high  market capitalization at high  percent drop  click to enlarge media analytics corp otcpkmeda disclosed budget  shares outstanding  promotion high  market capitalization at high  percent drop  click to enlarge american leisure holdings inc otcpkamlh disclosed budget  other sites disclosed all different amounts promotion high  percent drop  click to enlarge all these promotions were done with the whole group promoting this is the first time the group is promoting two tickers at the same time with all the other sites currently sending out emails on aren its my belief that gdee might be a one and done promotion by their one email list this could end up really badly for people who bought the promotion monday my recommendation if you own shares of this company get out now do not hope that you can hang on to sell them to a greater fool these shares are worthless i have shown you that the promotional mailers indicate that the individuals behind this stock scam are trying desperately to unload their worthless shares onto the unsuspecting public and book a huge profit before the inevitable collapse if you are a more sophisticated investor and can get a borrow on these shares then i believe that shorting this name will be highly lucrative for you i believe the huge unusual action in golden edge entertainment inc makes it at risk of an sec halt this will end up just like all their last picks  near  if you were burned on this one i recommend learning from it disclosure i amwe are short gdee i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking alpha i have no business

manufacturers with whom the company can contract for services and administrative efforts related to registration under the  act   note   summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” as promulgated in the united states of america the company is a development stage company as defined by section  of the fasb accounting standards codification the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiary bid data media llc the company is still devoting substantially all of its efforts to establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced  all losses accumulated since inception have been considered as part of the companys development stage activities   estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process actual results could differ significantly from those estimates   earnings per share   the company computes net income loss per share in accordance with the fasb accounting standards codification “asc” the asc  “earnings per share” specifies the computation presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings loss per share for entities with publicly held common stock   basic net earnings loss per share amounts are computed by dividing the net earnings loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding  common equivalent equity instruments such as  warrants were not included in the loss per share calculations because the inclusion would have been antidilutive the  warrants were outstanding as of june         revenue recognition   the company follows paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured since inception the company has not recognized any revenue from operations   cash and cash equivalent   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less   derivative financial instruments   the company evaluates all of its agreements to determine if such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives for derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations for stockbased derivative financial instruments the company uses the blackscholesmerton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates the classification of derivative instruments including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity is evaluated at the end of each reporting period derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or noncurrent based on whether or not netcash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within  months of the balance sheet date as of june   the company’s only derivative financial instrument was an embedded conversion feature associated with a convertible line of credit due to the conversion price being a percentage of the market price of the company’s stock at the date of conversion   stock based compensation   the company records stockbased compensation in accordance with the asc  “sharesbased compensation” fasb accounting standards classification using the fair value method all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued whichever is more reliably measurable equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued   income taxes   income taxes are provided in accordance with the asc  “income tax” fasb accounting standards classification a deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   recently adopted accounting standards in august  the fasb issued asu no  “presentation of financial statements – going concern subtopic  disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern” “asu ” asu  which is effective for annual reporting periods ending after december   extends the responsibility for performing the goingconcern assessment to management and contains guidance on how to perform a goingconcern assessment and when goingconcern disclosures would be required under us gaap the company elected to adopt asu  effective with this financial statement management’s evaluations regarding the events and conditions that raise substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern have been disclosed in  note  going concern     in april  fasb issued asu no  subtopic   simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  asu no  provides guidance that will require debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability asu no  affects disclosures related to debt issuance costs but does not affect existing recognition and measurement guidance for these items  asu no  is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december    the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or disclosures   recently issued accounting standards   asu  revenue from contracts with customers topic  which provides guidance for revenue recognition for contracts this guidance requires an entity to review contracts in five steps and will result in enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue arising from contracts with customers this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after december   we are currently evaluating the impact if any that this new guidance will have on the company’s consolidated financial statements   asu no  income taxes topic  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes was issued to simplify the classification of deferred taxes on the balance sheet the new guidance would require that deferred taxes be classified as noncurrent assets and liabilities based on the taxpaying jurisdiction application of the standard which can be applied prospectively or retrospectively is required for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and for interim periods within that year the adoption of the amended guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements   asu no  leases topic  on february   the fasb issued a new standard which requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a rightofuse asset and a lease liability  the new guidance will require the asset and liability to be initially measured at the present value of the lease payments in the statement of financial position  the new guidance will also require the company to recognize interest expense on the lease liability separately from the amortization of the rightuseasset for finance leases and recognize a single lease cost allocated on a straightline basis over the lease term for operating leases in the statement of comprehensive income  the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years with early application permitted  the company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on the company’s consolidated financial statements     note  going concern   the company’s operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including among others current and potential competitors with greater resources dependence on significant customers lack of operating history and uncertainty of future profitability and possible fluctuations in financial results in accordance with asu  management has evaluated the company’s ability to continue as a going concern management has determined that there is substantial doubt that the company will continue as a going concern due to the companys accumulated deficit of  as of june     december   the company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations andor obtain additional financing as may be required   the accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern however the above condition raises substantial doubt about the company’s ability to do so the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue in existence the officers and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs of the company                 note  convertible notes payable   the company received on july   a total of  by issuance of one convertible note for  the
