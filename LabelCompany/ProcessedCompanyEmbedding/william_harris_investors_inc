nonprofit organizations and private family foundations assisting our clients with the development of estate plans with significant charitable components establishing and advising new charitable entities and private foundations coordinating grantmaking efforts and assisting clients in the design and implementation of dynamic longterm plans in order to achieve their philanthropic goals   owing to the increasing complexity of tax regulations and to the differential tax and investment treatment afforded to certain nonprofit and charitable entities we recognize the critical importance of

philanthropic plans are not created equal at whi we pride ourselves on our ability to bring together best practices in the tax legal and investment management areas so as to ensure that our clients’

upon us not only to provide them with a broad spectrum of financial and wealth services but also to shield them from harm today among our greatest responsibilities is that of anticipating and mitigating risk on behalf of our clients   risks come in all shapes and sizes many of these risks are relatively obvious and lend themselves to straightforward mitigation techniques some however are more veiled or complex and require more creative contingency planning   relatively obvious risks include permanent portfolio impairment the failure to implement and maintain a proper estate plan and exposure of personal assets to creditors less obvious risks may include health risks the trustworthiness of household help the robustness of one’s health insurance or the potential for identity theft still other risks may be mitigated significantly by preventive measures including educating our clients on many of the opportunities and responsibilities that accompany wealth   at whi we see it as our responsibility to assist our clients in identifying potential sources of risk and uncertainty and then in a disciplined thorough and methodical manner implementing a broad spectrum of risk mitigation measures to reduce their exposure to sources of potential liability   there are times when the best offense is a good defense precisely because so few things in life are certain we see it

of the us stock market this economic crisis continued well into the s and many families lost their life savings when the banks to which they had entrusted their assets failed   in the wake of the depression people sought alternate means of safeguarding what remained of their financial assets it was in this spirit that several friends and customers of william harris who had lost faith in the banks came to him and asked him if he would be willing to safeguard their money for them he was a highly trusted and wellregarded businessman and they had more confidence in him than in the ailing financial institutions    long after the liquidation of the woolen business william harris  company continued to operate as a funds depository for and a lender of capital to members and close friends of the harris family   beginning in the s william’s eldest son irving was engaged in various business endeavors of his own most notably the purchase of the toni company a hair care company which he and his brother bought ran and then sold to gillette in   the wealth created from this sale allowed irving to focus on his passion for managing investment assets  in  irving became a partner of rj levy and company a new york stock exchange firm headquartered in new york  rj levy eventually became the harris group inc after robert levy’s death in    in  irving left the institutional investment counseling business to focus exclusively on managing his own family’s assets a handful of the remaining partners at harris group established harris associates an investment counseling firm that has

portfolio construction     at whi our investment management approach is predicated on the notion that a sensible asset allocation framework provides the basis for a properly constructed portfolio   whi’s asset allocation committee is comprised of a handful of our most senior investment professionals who possess more than a century of collective investment experience this committee conducts a quarterly asset allocation review which is informed by the views of whi’s investment teams as well as the outlooks of some of the most prominent institutions and astute investment managers globally  from this review we establish our own prospective views of the market including specific asset classes geographies and strategies where we expect there to be the potential for outsized returns andor significant risks   after overlaying upon this a quantitative framework to assess expectations for prospective correlations among asset classes our team establishes a “neutral” strategic asset allocation for a typical riskneutral client from which our team then defines more conservative and more aggressive portfolios as alternatives we further tailor these allocation models to suit the specific goals and objectives of individual clients   these models are modified from time to time to enable us to maintain longerduration balanced asset allocation targets while retaining the flexibility to make periodic tactical modifications to client accounts thereby providing shorterterm opportunities to realize outsized yields   we believe that this asset allocation process along with a comprehensive understanding of a client’s needs objectives and constraints will enable our team to design client portfolios that are properly balanced and likely to yield robust longterm investment returns while taking proper consideration of investment risks liquidity constraints and the clients current cash needs     this page requires adobe flash to upload documents please click to download
