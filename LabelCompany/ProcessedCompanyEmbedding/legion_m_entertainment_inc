the business plan as well as financial statements through december   if youd like to review the circular please click here and you will be redirected to the appropriate section of the secs website  thank you for considering an investment in legion m we couldn’t be more excited about the opportunity in front of us and are thrilled that you are considering joining us before you get into the offering circular there are a couple things we want to mention legion m is not a conventional company we don’t intend to become one most of this offering circular describes legion m in conventional business terms in fact the whole purpose of this document is to provide a convention for you to evaluate our company and make an informed investment decision but there are elements of legion m that defy convention and we want to take a moment to explain them in our own words risk vs reward before you invest it’s important to understand that legion m is a very early stage company in fact thanks to the jobs act you now have the opportunity to invest earlier than has ever been possible at a stage traditionally reserved for angel investors and venture capitalists if you want to get in early you need to understand the risks as an early stage company we don’t yet have established customers or revenue streams and we have very little operating history for you to review startups are an inherently risky investmentstatistically speaking most of them fail but those that succeed often go on to change the world every great company — from walt disney pictures to apple computer — started with entrepreneurs and investors who had the courage to defy the odds and try something no one else had done before we believe legion m is one of those companies we’ve beaten the odds before  and believe we can do it again as a rule you should never invest more than you can bear to lose in a startup company but if you’ve got a little extra and want to swing for the fences we’d love for you to join us we’re betting our money reputations and careers that we can make this company a success one million fans legion m is to our knowledge the first company built from the ground up to be owned by fans we’re building it that way because we believe a media company owned by fans has a fundamental competitive advantage over those owned by wall street or corporate conglomerates in fact our logo the m with a bar over it which is the roman numeral for one million represents our longterm goal of having one million shareholders join our company we believe that by uniting one million fans we can change the world for good that’s because fans hold all the power in the entertainment industry after all we’re the ones that buy the tickets pay the monthly subscriptions and decide what to watch as individuals we are simply consumers but when we stand together we have the power to revolutionize the way content is made redefining roi most companies view investors simply as a source of capital for legion m our investors are the foundation of our business we are a community as much as we are a corporation as a management team our job is to create value for this community while conventional companies define shareholder value solely by dollars and cents our definition goes one step farther financial roi legion m’s primary goal is to run a responsible business that earns money and increases our share price people are investing hardearned dollars and our job is to give them a return financial success is the key to the longterm viability of our companythe more successful we are

investment opportunities that i fervently believe will be disruptive forces in shaping our future for the better burton l warner more investors more investors details expand all can i make money from this that’s the whole point this is completely different than kickstarter or indiegogo where you donate in exchange for a reward perk or presale of the product when you invest in legion m you are buying stock in the company our job is to make the value of that stock go up how does legion m make money we’re taking a proven business model content production and adding a twist that gives us a competitive advantage fan ownership hollywood is fiercely competitive but there is money to be made if you are successful… especially if you are working with people that have a track record of success will legion m pay dividends not in the foreseeable future as an early stage company all revenue from projects will go back into the business allowing us to invest in more projects and to continue growing the value of the company overall do you offer perks your investment level doesn’t “buy” you perks after all people who invest in apple don’t get free iphones giving away perks like that dilutes our ability to make our projects successful instead we offer something much better… a chance to peek behind the curtain become part of a community participate in fun events and help steer a media company to success are there other benefits to investing absolutely as a legion m shareholder you get to come along for the ride as we work with top hollywood creators to release exciting new projects you’ll get invites to shareholderonly online hangouts with the cast and crew livestreamed tours of the set invites to exclusive shareholder meetings and all sorts of stuff like that aren’t you afraid of having too many cooks in the kitchen just because we bring you behind the scenes doesn’t mean you get to call the shots great art isn’t made by committeeit’s made by empowering great artists and then getting out of their way a lot of creators gets excited about working with us to find fun ways to engage with fans but ultimately we leave all the creative decisions to the creators why hasnt anyone done this before recent changes to securities law the jobs act have opened the door for the public to invest in early stage ventures like legion m before then only “accredited investors” ie the wealthiest  of the population were legally allowed to invest in companies like legion m now we’reopening the gates of hollywood for the rest of us do i get to pick the projects my investment goes toward no and there is good reason for that hollywood is a hitdriven business which means that it’s very risky to back any single project legion m is working with our creative allies to build a diversified slate of projects some may fail but others will likely succeed and the money we make from the hits will allow us to fund a new batch in that way were really no different from how hollywood studios operate because well spread the risk around to ensure legion m can keep doing this for a long time what is legion m’s competitive advantage our competitive advantage is our community as of this writing we have over  investors and  members by allowing people to own equity and come along for the ride we’re building a legion of fans that are financially and emotionally invested in our projects success that’s a huge advantage when it comes to things like marketing monetization distribution etc if you think about it fans hold all the power in the entertainment industry we buy the tickets pay the subscriptions and decide what to watch individually we’re just consumers but when we band together we have the power to change hollywood for good i want to invest is next month going to be too late all we can guarantee is that the reg a round will be open until it sells out or for  months whichever comes first keep in mind that the valuation for the company will be changing periodically throughout this round so the earlier you invest the lower the valuation and the lower the per share price why are you doing a regulation a fundraise it’s the next logical step in our company’s evolution we believe equity crowfunding is a terrific way to finance a media company because the more investors we have the more fans we have  a builtin fan base for all of our projects when we launched in march of  we had no idea if fans would want to coown an entertainment company like this our title iii round was recordsetting and massively oversubscribed with demand from our fans for more our fans are our secret superpower and this is the first entertainment company to allow fans in on the very ground floor regulation a of the “jumpstart our business startups act” or jobs act allows us to raise up to mm per calendar year the minimum investment is  but shares are  each will i own a fraction of a share if i invest the minimum we dont sell fractional shares so if you invested  you would get  shares  and a  refund its a little screwy but at the moment its just the way the platform is set up im sure wefunder will change that at some point as an investor will i get a credit in our projects as you probably know movie and tv credits can be quite trickyespecially when you are working with lots of other partners we love the idea of investor credits to that end we created the legion m photo mosaic which has pictures of our awesome investors and is part of our production company card… if you submit your photos to our mosaic project you will be in pictures legion members who work or volunteer on our projects get credits for doing the actual work and when we produce our own projects we’ll work hard to find a way to include legion investors as part of the credits – we just can’t guarantee it what do i do if i want to increase the amount of my initial investment it’s easy peasy lemon squeezy if you invested in this reg a round you can change your investment anytime as long as this reg a round is open to do so log in to wefunder with your account details and go back to our page at wwwwefundercomlegionm on that page the invest button should now be replaced with an edit investment button near the top of the page over the photo from there i think you can just follow the steps what is a subscription agreement” will the same amount invested be withdrawn from my bank account every month or something like that a subscription agreement is the legal contract between you and legion m to buy the shares we don’t know why it’s called that but this is the legal term for it  rest assured this is a onetime purchase and no recurring payments will be withdrawn from your account whats the exit plan legion m is focused on creating shareholder value and because we raised funds through a previous title iii and this reg a round we have in a sense already had a miniipo because the stock will be tradable once reg a closes and secondary markets come online as we create value in the company share price should increase and shareholders will be able to sell their stock and exit as they please our goal is to keep growing legion m long into the future how are you able to offer liquidity without being publicly listed on a stock exchange since the jobs act is so new some of this is still being worked out but there are exchanges being set up as we speak to enable the buying and selling of jobs act securities once our first round of reg a stock closes it becomes liquid so it can legally be sold traded and transferred so while the shares wont be on the nasdaq or nyse they will be tradable and there will be trading platforms supporting it soon are we subject to insider trading rules you betcha that’s why we can’t have any private “shareholder only” groups we have to include investors who have bought stock in the company and members who have joined for free in all of our communications and activities what does the m stand for in legion m we like legion because it represents a broad and strong community with a call to action we are a legion of fans reshaping the entertainment industry the m in our logo has a bar over it which is the roman numeral for  million and represents our longterm goal to have  million fans as our shareholders with a legion of  million fans we can be one of the most influential companies in hollywood how do i connect with the legion m community lots of ways… we have an amazing private memberonly facebook group and robust active forums you can connect with us on social media at facebook at httpswwwfacebookcomgroupsiamlegionm on twitter legionmofficial or via our forums sign up at httplegionmusforum and once you invest you will receive an email with all the details from us if you want to

joining our team who else is doing this in hollywood as far as we know no one… yet there are other entertainment companies out there doing reg cf raises under title iii of the jobs act but none have the same business model as legion m and none have initiated a reg a raise we’re totally unique and the first to market with the idea that fans have the power wow hollywood must really dislike legion m because it’s such a disruptor hardly to our delight this couldn’t be further from the truth hollywood needs legion m and we’ve had a fantastic response from every meeting and introduction starting with the creative allies that we have in place and evidenced by the fact that we have four highprofile projects officially on our slate with more to come hollywood studios and creatives see legion m as a valuable partner and we believe the best is yet to come with future partnerships and opportunities how do you select projects the criteria we use to select projects boils down to three questions  can we make money from it this isnt kickstarter  we are only interested in projects we feel can provide a financial return for our shareholders  is it fun in addition to financial return we aim to provide is an emotional returnwe want projects where we can engage our shareholders and bring the power of the legion to bear  are we making the world a better place we believe in using the power of the legion to do good in the world how can fans help make projects successful there is an old saying that content is king that saying is true but before it can become king it needs to rise above the noise there is an amazing amount content out there and a lot of it is really good the difference between financial success and failure often comes down to one simple element marketing thats where the legion comes in when you have a group of fans that are invested in contentespecially emotionally and financially invested like we are at legion m they are willing to get behind it tell their friends about it talk about it online see it on opening day etc this is exactly the sort of word of mouth advertising that brands are looking for if our fans show up when we have a new release we’ll be unstoppable film tv and vr are very different areas does being so diverse harm your ability to focus the buzz word is “transmedia” that means projects can be developed across formats legion m plans to develop partner and produce strong stories with great characters no matter the format and we’ll partner with experts in their respective fields to help us produce it because we’re building a slate of projects diversification across mediums allows us to stay nimble and chase after the very best projects our ultimate task is to find ways to monetize our content no matter the format – whether film tv vr merch games or otherwise by partnering with experts in all these respective fields we are in a great position to build transmedia properties that span multiple categories how can a legion of fans help you find new projects everyone in hollywood is always looking for the next great propertywhether it’s a book comic book or a creator on youtube having a legion of fans who can help scout and identify upandcoming voices and storytellers is a huge asset most production companies pay staffers to stay on top of all the current trends but in our case we have a legion of people excited and incented to tell us about a terrific new book or a funny video we need to watch how can a legion of fans help in the creative process the creators we work with love the idea of fan engagement as long as its done in the right way a lot of people think that engaging fans is about democratizing the creative process but that is completely wrong you dont make great art by committee and no creator wants to review arbitrary notes from tens of thousands of people that said there are plenty of ways for fans to get involved and for creators to use the legion as a resource we have seen several amazing examples of this over the past year the first was our initial company trailer we had two different cuts from two different voiceover artists internally we were split half of us preferred one half preferred the other the solution we put it out to the legion within  hours we had a clear winner and a huge amount of insight into which version resonated best with different demographics ultimately we ended up ordering both versions of the trailer and now use targeting to get each version in front of the demographics that liked it best other examples include using legion volunteers to staff our booth at stan lee’s los angeles comic con help shoot and produce our pitch elevator tv pilot and photograph and video the onset background during our icons shoot with stan lee and kevin smith all of these were  brought to you by legion m volunteers and staffers weve had discussions with our creative allies about how to involve the legion and before we take on any project that has to be a consideration luckily our allies have dozens of conceptsand the opportunity to get in front of a friendly audience for feedback is hugely powerful the ability to have fans play a role in what projects we greenlight is also powerful and the best part is that by making it fun it becomes a real benefit for all our shareholders what are some examples of legion m community initiatives our forums were  built by volunteer legion members we put the word out and said hey does anybody know anything about setting up forums or is anybody interested in volunteering we had  volunteers and we picked a team leader and she picked the team so now we have a robust and healthy forum solution that was completely built by volunteers with months of effort and now they manage it and maintain it they are amazing we have another initiative with a guy who is creating a collection of short stories called tales from the legion” which will be written exclusively by members of legion m he said hey there are so many creative people in the legion lets create a book filled with stories from legion members and investors that we can sell as an ebook or as a hardcover print ondemand book hes off and running and its being sourced  from the community also legion m had a huge presence at the  stan lee los angeles comic con where we staffed an awesome booth shot a digital tv series and premiered our pitch elevator competition – all of which was staffed and run by legion m member volunteers we had a blast meeting our members working with them and hearing their ideas we were the most successful vendor at the con due to the dedication and enthusiasm of our volunteers and we loved working with all of them how can i let my legion m flag shine for the world to see lots of ways about  members across the country have received personalized legion m license plates and one even got a tattoo at your request we will mail you a welcome packet with some legion m swag like stickers and marketing cards and of course you can buy legion m tshirts hockey jerseys name badges and pins in our online store httpsthelegionmcomstore we encourage creativity and are always open to hearing from merchandising partners let us know if you have any ideas will legion m produce my script or hire me as an actor or director whenever possible well give priority to the legion community when it comes to sourcing and staffing projects we have a submission page on our website at wwwthelegionmcomsubmissions if you want to be added to the list when we open our doors for script submissions there are thousands of people on thatlist already so there is a lot of competition we also have a job board in our forums for members to post staffingcasting needs as our projects or even other people’s projects ramp up we obviously cant promise every investor a job or that we will back their projects but when we can our ideal will be to work within our community we also periodically have events and contests which give you the opportunity to submit your ideas pitch elevator was one opportunity we launched fall of  where the winners idea will get a development deal with legion m and we’ll have an open call for narrative prose stories for the short story collection book tales from the legion spring  how much do we need to raise in the reg a to be successful it’s really less about the money we raise and more about the number of people and shareholders we can get onboard our first goal will be to raise mm which will ensure that well be in business for the next couple of years and really be able to make a run at this once we raise that we’ll try to raise a couple million more taking one step at a time as we march toward the ultimate longterm goal of having a million shareholders what was mobitv we cofounders paul scanlan and jeff annison along with another friend of oursphillip alvelda cofounded mobitv in  we were the first company in the us and pretty much the entire world to launch live television on your cellphone at the time we were almost laughed out of hollywood people told usand we are not exaggerating herethat it was the dumbest idea they had ever heard… nobody is ever going to watch television on their cell phone now in fairness to them this was  the screens were really small and the video quality was very poor by todays standards it was years before the iphoneeven before the razr we were working on some of the very first phones with colorscreens also at the time the only place people watched tv was in the living room it seems crazy to think about it now but most people thought there wasnt any demand for television outside the living room yet when we launched it took off like wildfire over the last  years it has been the fastestgrowing part of the entertainment industry in fact we had such an impact we were awarded a primetime emmy award for our contributions to the television industry we grew those services to over  million paying subscribers around the world and the company is still going strong today chances are if you have watched tv on your att sprint or tmobile device it was powered by mobitv we pioneered that whole space we were even the first to do live tv on the iphone not to mention the first to do march madness world cup nfl nba olympics and more what is premoney valuation and how does legion m calculate it the premoney valuation is effectively the price at which you are buying into the company over time if were successful this value will grow if you take the companys valuation and divide it by the number of outstanding shares it gives you the value of each share conversely if you take the number of outstanding shares and multiply it by the share price you end up with valuationthe same way youd calculate market cap for a public company legion m is different then most early stage companies in that we dont have any financial preferences amongst our shareholders our two classes of stock have different voting rights but financially they are equivalent that means all of us  the founders insiders and every single one of our investors  have the exact same terms were all in the same boat none of us wins unless all of us win when we calculate our premoney valuation we include all issued shares options and warrants  even those that have not yet vested or been exercised however unlike most vc deals we do not include stock options that have not yet been issued ie the option pool thats because when we issue stock options the strike price is the current market price this is very different than vc deals where options are typically issued for pennies on the dollar due to the price difference between common and preferred in a vc deal the option pool represents pure dilution for investors in our case it simply represents a potential
