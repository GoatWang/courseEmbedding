petrogas  home about us products ceramic balls activated alumina gamma alumina tabular alumina high purity alumina balls silica gel claus catalysts molecular sieves services certification contact us products inert bed support  topping proper packing of the catalyst in the converter and protecting the catalyst bed from external impurities are essential for obtaining efficiency alumina balls lumps rings pellets etc used as bed toppings and bed supports act as filters to remove many impurities from the gas stream and help in uniform distribution of the feed gas layers of these materials on top and bottom of the catalyst bed keep the bed intact during pressure fluctuations hence it survives depressurization maintains its integrity and does not crack break or shatter under severe environment the product uniformity is extremely important for optimization of all aspects of catalyst in a reaction petrogas bed support and topping have excellent product uniformity which is achieved by careful selection of raw materials precise manufacturing techniques and consistent quality control we manufacture high medium and low purity alumina products strictly in accordance with relevant international standards and as per customer specifications tabular alumina our pgt series tabular alumina is used in several renowned plants worldwide for high temperature and critical applications since 9 the high mechanical strength thermal shock resistance smooth surfacelow porosityability to withstand temperature of 900 deg c plus long lifeetc have prompted most customers to specify this product for trouble free process conditions and to protect their expensive catalysts high purity alumina balls petrogas series pg0 products are mostly used in petrochemical and fertilizer industries petroleum refineriesgas processing and liquefaction industries fused alumina some speciality chemical plants have applications for this product under our pgfa series that provide inertness high temperature resistanceacid resistance and process optimization ceramic balls our pg pg pg pg series balls are ideal and standard products used in oil  gas industries and refineries technical data sheets pertaining to each categories of the products are available on request petrogas have been supplying to almost all leading refineries for more than two decades our clients use petrogas support balls with confidence by specifying our product code for repeat orders to avoid ordering substandard products most of the clients know that ceramic bals with poor quality will damage the process and the refinery may have to shut down prematurely incurring huge damages our products pg pg etc withstand all known tests including hydrogen depressurization so that the user could be rest assured of the quality of the support they are using quartz pebbles tower packing and fillings require products that are tested over the years steel plants are major clients of this product pg quartz pebbles meet all norms required in steel industries and have a long lasting performance we have developed a new product suitable for blast furnace applications in competitive range with better performance pg exclusive for steel industries porous balls we have engineered this product for space shuttles launching facilities to adsorb the toxic gases generated in the launch pad and these have been designed and engineered for specific applications too pgpor are also used in nuclear facilities alumina gel some of the important uses of alumina gel are in the manufacture of catalysts pharmaceuticals rubber cosmetic and paper industries silica gel synthetic amorphous silicon dioxidesiosorbentsorbead silica for industrial use are supplied to meet customers requirements it is a hard granular desiccant with the appearance of crushed glass it is slightly softer than ordinary window glass odorless insoluble and nonconductor of electricity its action in adsorbing moisture is purely physical and there is no change in size or shape of the particle as it adsorbs vapour silica gel has a very strong affinity for water which give it an adsorption capacity of over  of its own weight at 00 relative humidity its major application is moisture adsorption from airgas streams and from organic liquid such as ethanol benzene etc it is also used for preferential chemical adsorption to remove polar contaminates from non polar solventseg butanol from butyl chloride indicator silica gel is used where visual indication is required to show the need for regeneration granular and beaded indicating and non indicating silica geletc are supplied by us exactly to customers specifications gamma alumina catalyst carriers activated alumina catalyst carriers are required to have excellent purity and adequate mechanical strength in order to facilitate proper impregnation of active ingredients additionally a very high adsorptive capacity and high surface area make it suitable for nox removal and other toxic vapors removal catalysts thus it has substantial use in industrial pollution properties high purity alumina carriers in the form of rings spheres and tablets are used in different catalyst manufacturing processes our group produces them suitable for all purposes based on requests ceramic grinding media petrogas expertise in technical ceramics has been proved in a wide variety of applications and industries including users of ball mills  ceramic materials are hard corrosion resistant chemically inert non toxic non magnetic and non porous these characteristics are well utilised for mill linings and grinding media for ball mills we produce sintered alumina or ceramic linings  grinding media for use in many dry and wet grinding process activated alumina activated alumina is a higly porous form of aluminium oxide with enhanced surface area it is used for the adsorption of liquids and gases  one major application of activated alumina is as desiccant  either for the removal of bulk quantities of water or for drying of gases containing low concentration of water the substances that can be treated with activated alumina are air ammonia argoncarbon dioxide furnace gas hydrocarbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen hydrogen sulphide benzene gasoline lubricating oilnaptha vegetable oil kerosene etc claus catalysts the clause process is used by the sulfur recovery industry which converts hydrogen sulfide into elemental sulfur and water the sour natural gases have plenty of hydrogen sulfide within and if such gases are burned as fuel sulfide escapes resulting in air pollution and damage to our tender enviornment it has become an inevitable demand of mankind to convert maximum quantity of sulfur from sour gas activated alumina is the most widely used claus catalyst which contains a large number of catalytically active surface sites that absorbs hydrogen sulfide hs and sulfur dioxide so for subsequent reaction to yield elemental sulfur in many acid gas streams sulfur is present in various compounds such as hs cos cs etc some of them may not be present in the feed gas but cumbustion of hs in the presence of co or hydrocarbons could result the formation of coscs these compounds must be converted to ensure proper sulfur conversion since the decomposition rate of these compounds are at lower rate than that of hsso reaction a highly active catalyst is required sulfation can be another problem as it reduces surface area and hence the deactivation of catalyst molecular sieves pgms series molecular sieves are highly efficient adsorbents mainly used to adsorb water methanol ethanol sulfated hydrogen carbon dioxide ethylene propylene lpg etc it is used as desiccant in industries for deep drying of air natural gas and refigerant the product is available in shapes such as sphere  cylindrical pellets etc it is crystalline aluminosilicate mostly used types are a a a x xapg etc and we custom produce all these to the cleints special applications zinc oxide desulphurizationsulfur catalysts these are manufactured for sulphur removal or desulphurization and are availbale in different sizes and specifications we also have proprietary catalysts with promoter and binder in extrudate form used for low temparature sulfur adsorption petrogas pc90 series catalysts are used by many petrochemical industries chloride adsorbent reformer hcl guard typically used
