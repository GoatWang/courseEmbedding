contact us so we can help you click on the links below to view answers how can you tell if a scroll is running backwards   three phase scrolls can rotate in either direction depending on how it is wired if running in reverse rotation the compressor will have elevated sound levels reduced current draw and suction pressures will not drop along with a non rise in discharge pressure the compressor will eventually trip on motor protector where do i find what the approved refrigerants are for compressors   compressor refrigerant ratings are based on engineering design displacement and motor specifications these and other factors are used to determine the refrigerant type and application this information is found using the online product information section of our website or by contacting your nearest authorized emerson wholesaler how can the btu rating of a compressor be determined   capacity ratings for copeland® compressors are found on our published performance curves these curves can be obtained through our wholesalers or from the online product information section of our website to use these curves convert the measured suction and discharge pressure readings to their corresponding evaporating and condensing temperatures using a pressuretemperature chart for the refrigerant being used plotting those temperatures on the performance curve tables will reveal the btuh ratings amperage and watts what is the recommended super heat of copeland® compressors   to insure proper compressor cooling and lubrication the minimum operating compressor superheat is  f what is the discharge temperature limit of copeland® compressors   typically the maximum dlt is  f however this temperature can vary depending on specific applications how do you check oil pressure on a semihermetic compressor   net oil pressure is found by subtracting the crankcase pressure from the pressure measured at the oil pump outlet can i mix polyol ester poe and mineral oil mo together   when using cfc or hchc refrigerants poe and mo can be mixed the exception is r that only uses mo or alkyl benzene mineral oil abmo blend hfc refrigerants can only use poe oil where do i find what contactor a compressor takes   contactors can be found in the application bulletin  these bulletins can be located using the online product information section of our website or by contacting your local authorized emerson wholesaler where can i find what starting components a compressor takes   the best place to see what starting components a compressor takes is on this website under online produce information other sources include the emerson climate technologies inc electrical handbook and product information sheet however use caution on when referring to the product information sheets as these may be out dated and contain obsolete information what is the viscosity of poe oil   the viscosity of oils used in copeland® compressors is selected by design of the compressors and varies from  to  centistokes refer to emerson publication no r for further details does emerson have published cross reference information   yes to cross an obsolete compressor or unit to what supersedes it or to cross a competitor to a copeland® compressor log into the online product information section of our website and look under supersession where do i find the bolt torque specifications for copelametic compressors   bolt torque specifications for copelametic compressors can be found in the application bulletins  these bulletins are located using the online product information section of our website or by contacting your local authorized emerson wholesaler can i add an additive to the oil in a system   no additives are not permitted refer to application bulletin  how can i determine the type and quantity of oil in a compressor   this information can be found on the compressor nameplate the oil type will be abbreviated for example min meaning mineral oil or poe meaning polyol ester oil the oil amount is the number found beneath the oil type and is a unit measure of fluid ounces us so if it says  which means  fluid ounces are laser and delta reed valve plate kits interchangeable   due to engineering design differences of the compressor bodies and valve methods valve plate kits are not interchangeable pagecopy   pagecopy   pagecopy emerson climate technologies
