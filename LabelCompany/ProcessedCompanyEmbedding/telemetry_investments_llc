distributed architecture netacquire systems use the proven clientserver architecture for optimized realtime data acquisition and control an operational system is composed of two parts the netacquire server and the client core realtime activities such as data capture processing and closed loop control are executed on the netacquire server close to the point of sensor connection the less timecritical activities such as data display are located on one or more client computers running windows linux or java the netacquire software environment is an openarchitecture and allows customized extensions to tailor both client and server capabilities serverside core realtime activities such as data capture buffering processing and closed loop control are executed on the netacquire server close each hardware interface  maximizes data quality and ensures timely data processing clientside data display and operator interfaces are located on one or more desktop computers running windows or linux  allows familiar desktop graphic user interfaces with no distance limitation or scalability constraints even in applications where a netacquire system is physically close to the desktop operator interface there are important benefits to the automatic netacquire partitioning of an application onto two processors each running its own purposebuilt software environment serverside intelligence and realtime processing netacquire architecture click to enlarge netacquire servers are equipped with multicore processors the advantages of local processing include the ability to do realtime data

of telemetry signal across a wide range of ipbased networks with very low latency the netacquire tmoip option added to a netacquire realtime processor reads typical electrical input signals and converts the resulting data streams into ethernet packets for network transmission a second netacquire server reads the data from the network and reconstitutes the data back into the equivalent electrical output signals at remote locations datasheettechnical specs click to see larger image intelligent tmoip netacquire tmoip has many advantages over a fixedmode serialtoethernet device now in its seventh generation the netacquire product architecture is characterized as intelligent tmoip a white paper describing the many additional capabilities available as part of netacquires intelligent tmoip products is available autoconfiguration and continuous tuning netacquire tmoip products automatically adapt to changes in telemetry and network conditions avoiding the need for operator intervention and improving system uptime telemetry data rates are automatically detected and tracked network latency and jitter are continuously measured and adaptive buffering engages to minimize communications latency while ensuring that no data is dropped netacquire tmoip also automatically conserves network bandwidth by detecting when telemetry signals are inactive and suppressing generation of unnecessary network packets advanced system management an advanced top level system management capability shows information from the endpoints on each side of the tmoip connection enabling more effective trouble shooting diagnostics this toplevel viewed includes all key system status parameters including network health operator drilldown capabilities provide useful additional information including channel status inputoutput counts io parameters error counts and irig timing serial channel status includes detection and reporting of no data or no clock signal electrical conditions which are important for rapid diagnosis of external wiringsignal issues in addition the actual telemetry data from any input channel can be viewed directly from the management interface reliability and time correlation the data integrity and data timing are maintained throughout the telemetry distribution process netacquire intelligent tmoip preserves the timing correlation of the signals from the source side to the destination side network transport of irig abg timing signals is a standard capability for netacquire tmoip systems if an irig timing signal input is supplied the irig output timing is accurately reconstituted at each destination netacquire tmoip uses agile frequency synthesis and tracking capability on all output channels to avoid serial bit slips and data padding that result from inputtooutput timing mismatch conditions frequency resolution is better than   partpermillion across telemetry data rates ranging from  bps to  mbps resulting in very low jitter other highreliability features include automatic reconnection following recovery from network failures quality of service channel prioritization makes sure that most important data goes through the network first and the ability to reconfigure most system properties dynamically without the need for a system restart network mesh flexibility netacquire intelligent tmoip design overcomes the restrictions of traditional pointtopoint communication products by supporting delivery of telemetry data to multiple endpoints simultaneously these sophisticated onetomany and fully dynamic mesh configurations are easily supported network data consumers in additional to serial data output netacquire intelligent tmoip supports simultaneous delivery of telemetry data directly to pcs and other ethernet devices integrated telemetry frame synchronization can deliver telemetry data network packets that are framealigned for easeofprocessing netacquire offers an extensive suite of tools for
