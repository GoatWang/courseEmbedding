removal from the csaf post by secdef dick cheney for illtimed and inappropriate comments to the news media regarding iraq during operation desert shield mcpeak took over as chief of staff during the runup for operation desert shield and assisted in overall strategic planning for operation desert storm his later tenure as csaf following the gulf war also saw a major reduction in force rif in terms of aircraft units officers and enlisted airmen across the entire air force as a result of the end of the cold war during his time as chief of staff he oversaw the disestablishment of strategic air

primarily to the newlyestablished air combat command acc air mobility command amc air force materiel command afmcand the thenair force communications agency his tenure also oversaw the merging of air training command atc and air university au into the air education and training command aetc mcpeak pushed through major organizational changes in the air force aimed at streamlining and emphasizing operations and combat readiness much of his tenure focused on elevating the status of flight operations especially singleseat fighter pilots some say at the expense of multiseat fighter bomber and reconnaissance aircraft and personnel cargo and air refueling aircraft and personnel and nonflying career fields he also created the air force expeditionary wing concept a fusion of combat forces and support into a single organization he also transferred several flying wing and space wing command billets to brigadier generals even though previously these had been commanded by colonels however mcpeak is best remembered by many current and sinceretired senior air force personnel for the sweeping changes he made to the air forces service dress uniform especially for commissioned officers worn by more personnel during most duties the new version was a radical departure from the earlier version which was essentially the same design as the thenus army service uniform the us air force was originally the us army air corps and then the us army air forces but with fewer insignia because of the new uniforms resemblance to both commissioned officers uniforms of the us navy and those of commercial airline pilots the mcpeak uniform was said to be unpopular with air force service members these uniform changes were subsequently reversed by his successor the basic redesign continues to be worn to this day but the navalized sleeve braid rank insignia for officers was eliminated and name tags reinstituted albeit in silver metal versus the blue plastic nametags worn with the earlier uniform with the blue plastic nametags still worn on service uniform shirts mcpeaks original concept of simplifying and toning down the various devices and insignia pinned to the uniform has gone by the wayside with nearly all usaf personnel wearing at least one if not two three or more metal insignia with their dress uniforms mcpeak also acted as secretary of the air force for three weeks in  during an interim before the formal appointment and confirmation of sheila e widnall as of that date becoming the only person to have ever concurrently served in both capacities mcpeak continued as chief of staff through october  retiring afterwards mcpeaks legacy as chief of staff has been considered in several quarters as one of the most controversial in us air force history and has been the subject of much debate many air force senior officers and senior enlisted personnel both active and retired from the regular air force the air force reserve and the air national guard have accused him of trying to run the air force as a corporation with his introduction of total quality management tqm under the moniker of quality air force qaf as well as the uniform changes he unilaterally implemented which strayed from a traditional landbased military style some of his uniform changes were soon undone after his retirement by his successor as usaf chief of staff rightly or wrongly mcpeak was also often accused of ignoring the needs of enlisted personnel nonflying officers aeronauticallyrated navigator officers and looking out solely for his officers who were pilots primarily singleseat fighter pilots there was even debate over the somewhat traditional act of inducting him as the outgoing chief of staff into the order of the sword some of this controversy may also be traced at least in part to the abrupt manner in which general mcpeak had replaced general michael dugan as chief of staff of the air force general dugan a popular and wellintentioned officer had sought to repair the air forces image badly frayed by the services withholding of embarrassing information about the performance of the f nighthawk during the invasion of panama dugan had also sought to make top air force officials more accessible but he was relieved of command by thensecretary of defense dick cheney shortly before the start of operation desert storm and the first gulf war following some intemperate remarks dugan had made to the news media about targeting iraqi leader saddam hussein under united nations security council resolution  prior to the start of hostilities this despite the fact that as air force chief of staff dugan had no command authority within the us central command theater of operations in short order cheney quickly replaced dugan with mcpeak as chief of staff although dugan was retained as a star special advisor by the secretary of defense until dugans retirement from the air force later workedit following his air force career mcpeak entered the private sector as a consultant and business executive he has been on the boards of directors for twa ecc international where he served for several years as chairman tektronix sensis corporation gencorps and other corporations mcpeak and his wife elynor currently reside in lake oswego oregon she served as a member of the lake oswego city council mcpeak was appointed in july  to the american

members of its hall of fame he was among the initial seven inductees to the oregon aviation hall of honor in may  mcpeak published hangar flying the first volume of the aerial view trilogy three memoirs that will document his career in the air force the book was followed by volume  below the zone in november  israeledit mcpeak was harshly criticized by american spectator journalist robert goldberg for comments and writings he has made regarding israel goldberg begins the piece saying that mcpeak has a long history of criticizing israel for not going back to the  borders as part of any peace agreement with arab states in  mcpeak wrote an article for foreign affairs magazine questioning israels insistence on holding on to the golan heights and parts of the west bank goldberg writes that in recent years mcpeak has echoed the mearsheimerwalt view that american middle east policy is being controlled by jews at the expense of americas interests in the region goldberg then quotes mcpeak responding to a question as to what is the cause for the lack of progressing in getting israelis and palestinians together new york city miami we have a large vote  vote here in favor of israel and no politician wants to run against it goldberg also wrote that mcpeak claims that a combination of jews and christian zionists are manipulating us policy in iraq in dangerous and radical ways to support this claim goldberg quotes mcpeak from a published interview lets say that one of your abiding concerns is the security of israel as opposed to a purely american selfinterest then it would make sense to build a dozen or so bases in iraq lets say you are a bornagain christian and you think that armageddon and the rapture are about to happen any minute and what you want to do is retrace steps you think are laid out in revelations then it makes sense so there are a number of scenarios here that could lead you in this direction this is radical mcpeaks responseedit more than  years ago  i wrote and foreign affairs published an article now being circulated in the blogosphere as evidence of an alleged antiisrael point of view some commentators reach farther suggesting that since i have been an active supporter of barack obamas presidential bid he too is antiisrael both these assertions fall flat after any objective reading of the historical record i am a longtime admirer and think myself a friend of israel in the early s i played a key role in getting advanced weaponry released to the israeli air force  capabilities it later put to active use during that period i made many official visits to israel and established close relationships there these contacts turned out to be useful during operation desert storm when as chief of staff of the us air force i worked with my israeli counterparts to help defend israel from iraqi scud missile attacks i was a vocal opponent of the george w bush administrations decision to invade iraq a strategic blunder made worse by slapdash execution as we have seen this starcrossed action took our eye off the ball in afghanistan breathed new life into a moribund al qaeda and enhanced iranian influence in this critical region  all outcomes which damaged both the united states and our ally israel it is my view and hope that israel will have our continued support i wish it every success of course what israel regards as success is up to it to decide but for friends like me success means a secure israel at peace with neighbors who recognize and respect its existence even so we should maintain our special relationship and help israel keep its qualitative military edge as for the article much has changed in  years and much has not the essential argument holds no set of realistically achievable geographic borders produces safety for israel rather the security requirement is that any of the territory taken in the sixday war and given back as part of a peace settlement should be effectively demilitarized of course the sinai peninsula was returned to egypt long ago in exactly this way resulting in relative quiet along israels southern border and creating a fundamental shift in the regional balance of forces this opportunity was not skillfully exploited so the result has been a cold peace but it is nevertheless peace and has served the interests of both sides political activitiesedit in  mcpeak

shield and assisted in overall strategic planning for operation desert storm his later tenure as csaf following the gulf war also saw a major reduction in force rif in terms of aircraft units officers

atc and air university au into the air education and training command aetc mcpeak pushed through major organizational changes in the air force aimed at streamlining and emphasizing operations and combat readiness much of his tenure focused on elevating the status of flight operations especially singleseat fighter pilots some say at the expense of multiseat fighter bomber and reconnaissance aircraft and personnel cargo and air refueling aircraft and personnel and nonflying career fields he also created the air force expeditionary wing concept a fusion of combat forces and support into a single organization he also transferred several flying wing and space wing command billets to brigadier generals even though previously these had been commanded by colonels however mcpeak is best remembered by many current and sinceretired senior air force personnel for the sweeping changes he made to the air forces service dress uniform especially for commissioned officers worn by more personnel during most duties the new version was a radical departure from the earlier version which was essentially the same design as the thenus army service uniform the us air force was originally the us army air corps and then the us army air forces but with fewer insignia because of the new uniforms resemblance to both commissioned officers uniforms of the us navy and those of commercial airline pilots the mcpeak uniform was said to be unpopular with air force service members these uniform changes were subsequently reversed by his successor the basic redesign continues to be worn to this day but the navalized sleeve braid rank insignia for officers was eliminated and name tags reinstituted albeit in silver metal versus the blue plastic nametags worn with the earlier uniform with the blue plastic nametags still worn on service uniform shirts mcpeaks original concept of simplifying and toning down the various devices and insignia pinned to the uniform has gone by the wayside with nearly all usaf personnel wearing at least one if not two three or more metal insignia with their dress uniforms mcpeak also acted as secretary of the air force for three weeks in  during an interim before the formal appointment and confirmation of sheila e widnall as of that date becoming the only person to have ever concurrently served in both capacities mcpeak continued as chief of staff through october  retiring afterwards mcpeaks legacy as chief of staff has been considered in several quarters as one of the most controversial in us air force history and has been the subject of much debate many air force senior officers and senior enlisted personnel both active and retired from the regular air force the air force reserve and the air national guard have accused him of trying to run the air force as a corporation with his introduction of total quality management tqm under the moniker of quality air force qaf as well as the uniform changes he unilaterally implemented which strayed from a traditional landbased military style some of his uniform changes were soon undone after his retirement by his successor as usaf chief of staff rightly or wrongly mcpeak was also often accused of ignoring the needs of enlisted personnel nonflying officers aeronauticallyrated navigator officers and looking out solely for his officers who were pilots primarily singleseat fighter pilots there was even debate over the somewhat traditional act of inducting him as the outgoing chief of staff into the order of the sword some of this controversy may also be traced at least in part to the abrupt manner in which general mcpeak had replaced general michael dugan as chief of staff of the air force general dugan a popular and wellintentioned officer had sought to repair the air forces image badly frayed by the services withholding of embarrassing information about the performance of the f nighthawk during the invasion of panama dugan had also sought to make top air force officials more accessible but he was relieved of command by thensecretary of defense dick cheney shortly before the start of operation desert storm and the first gulf war following some intemperate remarks dugan had made to the news media about targeting iraqi leader saddam hussein under united nations security council resolution  prior to the start of hostilities this despite the fact that as air force chief of staff dugan had no command authority within the us central command theater of operations in short order cheney quickly replaced dugan with mcpeak as chief of staff although dugan was retained as a star special advisor by the secretary of defense until dugans retirement from the air force later workedit following his air force career mcpeak entered the private sector as a consultant and business executive he has been on the boards of directors for twa ecc international where he served for several years as chairman tektronix sensis corporation gencorps and other corporations mcpeak and his wife elynor currently reside in lake oswego oregon she served as a member of the lake oswego city council mcpeak was appointed in july  to the american battle monuments commission he is the tenth chairman and the first airman to lead the commission in  san diego state university gave its first ever lifetime achievement award to general mcpeak in  george washington university honored him with its distinguished alumni award the george in  on the occasion of the th anniversary of the founding of sigma chi fraternity he was selected as one of  members of its hall of fame he was among the initial seven inductees to the oregon aviation hall of honor in may  mcpeak published hangar flying the first volume of the aerial view trilogy three memoirs that will document his career in the air force the book was followed by volume  below the zone in november  israeledit mcpeak was harshly criticized by american spectator journalist robert goldberg for comments and writings he has made regarding israel goldberg begins the piece saying that mcpeak has a long history of criticizing israel for not going back to the  borders as part of any peace agreement with arab states in  mcpeak wrote an article for foreign affairs magazine questioning israels insistence on holding on to the golan heights and parts of the west bank goldberg writes that in recent years mcpeak has echoed the mearsheimerwalt view that american middle east policy is being controlled by jews at the expense of americas interests in the region goldberg then quotes mcpeak responding to a question as to what is the cause for the lack of progressing in getting israelis and palestinians together new york city miami we have a large vote  vote here in favor of israel and no politician wants to run against it goldberg also wrote that mcpeak claims that a combination of jews and christian zionists are manipulating us policy in iraq in dangerous and radical ways to support this claim goldberg quotes mcpeak from a published interview lets say that one of your abiding concerns is the security of israel as opposed to a purely american selfinterest then it would make sense to build a dozen or so bases in iraq lets say you are a bornagain christian and you think that armageddon and the rapture are about to happen any minute and what you want to do is retrace steps you think are laid out in revelations then it makes sense so there are a number of scenarios here that could lead you in this direction this is radical mcpeaks responseedit more than  years ago  i wrote and foreign affairs published an article now being circulated in the blogosphere as evidence of an alleged antiisrael point of view some commentators reach farther suggesting that since i have been an active supporter of barack obamas presidential bid he too is antiisrael both these assertions fall flat after any objective reading of the historical record i am a longtime admirer and think myself a friend of israel in the early s i played a key role in getting advanced weaponry released to the israeli air force  capabilities it later put to active use during that period i made many official visits to israel and established close relationships there these contacts turned out to be useful during operation desert storm when as chief of staff of the us air force i worked with my israeli counterparts to help defend israel from iraqi scud missile attacks i was a vocal opponent of the george w bush administrations decision to invade iraq a strategic blunder made worse by slapdash execution as we have seen this starcrossed action took our eye off the ball in afghanistan breathed new life into a moribund al qaeda and enhanced iranian influence in this critical region  all outcomes which damaged both the united states and our ally israel it is my view and hope that israel will have our continued support i wish it every success of course what israel regards as success is up to it to decide but for friends like me success means a secure israel at peace with neighbors who recognize and respect its existence even so we should maintain our special relationship and help israel keep its qualitative military edge as for the article much has changed in  years and much has not the essential argument holds no set of realistically achievable geographic borders produces safety for israel rather the security requirement is that any of the territory taken in the sixday war and given back as part of a peace settlement should be effectively demilitarized of course the sinai peninsula was returned to egypt long ago in exactly this way resulting in relative quiet along israels southern border and creating a fundamental shift in the regional balance of forces this opportunity was not skillfully exploited so the result has been a cold peace but it is nevertheless peace and has served the interests of both sides political activitiesedit in  mcpeak served as oregon state chairman for the bob dole for president campaign during the presidential election of  mcpeak endorsed george w bush and served as cochairman of oregon veterans for bush as the military and foreign policy of the bush administration coalesced however mcpeak expressed strong objections especially with regard to the  invasion of iraq mcpeak later openly campaigned for howard deans nomination and when dean withdrew acted as an adviser for the john kerry campaign he was also one of twentyseven signatories to the statement of the committee of diplomats  commanders for change calling the bush administration a failure at preserving national security and calling for bush not to be reelectedcitation needed mcpeak was a cochair of barack obamas  presidential campaign he generated controversy following comments he made at a campaign appearance in medford oregon where he implied that former president bill clinton had appeared to question obamas patriotism as one who for  years proudly wore the uniform of our country im saddened to see a president employ these tactics he of all people should know better because he was the target of exactly the same kind of tactics mcpeak also compared the former presidents comments to mccarthyism i grew up i was going to college when joe mccarthy was accusing good americans of being traitors so ive had enough of it east timoredit according to

arab states in  mcpeak wrote an article for foreign affairs magazine questioning israels insistence on holding on to the golan heights and parts of the west bank goldberg writes that in recent years mcpeak has echoed the mearsheimerwalt view that american middle east policy is being controlled by jews at the expense of americas interests in the region goldberg then quotes mcpeak responding to a question as to what is the cause for the lack of progressing in getting israelis and palestinians together new york city miami we have a large vote  vote here in favor of israel and no politician wants to run against it goldberg also wrote that mcpeak claims that a combination of jews and christian zionists are manipulating us policy in iraq in dangerous and radical ways to support this claim goldberg quotes mcpeak from a published interview lets say that one of your abiding concerns is the security of israel as opposed to a purely american selfinterest then it would make sense to build a dozen or so bases in iraq lets say you are a bornagain christian and you think that armageddon and the rapture are about to happen any minute and what you want to do is retrace steps you think are laid out in revelations then it makes sense so there are a number of scenarios here that could lead you in this direction this is radical mcpeaks responseedit more than  years ago  i wrote and foreign affairs published an article now being circulated in the blogosphere as evidence of an alleged antiisrael point of view some commentators reach farther suggesting that since i have been an active supporter of barack obamas presidential bid he too is antiisrael both these assertions fall flat after any objective reading of the historical record i am a longtime admirer and think myself a friend of israel in the early s i played a key role in getting advanced weaponry released to the israeli air force  capabilities it later put to active use during that period i made many official visits to israel and established close relationships there these contacts turned out to be useful during operation desert storm when as chief of staff of the us air force i worked with my israeli counterparts to help defend israel from iraqi scud missile attacks i was a vocal opponent of the george w bush administrations decision to invade iraq a strategic blunder made worse by slapdash execution as we have seen this starcrossed action took our eye off the ball in afghanistan breathed new life into a moribund al qaeda and enhanced iranian influence in this critical region  all outcomes which damaged both the united states and our ally israel it is my view and hope that israel will have our continued support i wish it every success of course what israel regards as success is up to it to decide but for friends like me success means a secure israel at peace with neighbors who recognize and respect its existence even so we should maintain our special relationship and help israel keep its qualitative military edge as for the article much has changed in  years and much has not the essential argument holds no set of realistically achievable geographic borders produces safety for israel rather the security requirement is that any of the territory taken in the sixday war and given back as part of a peace settlement should be effectively demilitarized of course the sinai peninsula was returned to egypt long ago in exactly this way resulting in relative quiet along israels southern border and creating a fundamental shift in the regional balance of forces this opportunity was not skillfully exploited so the result has been a cold peace but it is nevertheless peace and has served the interests of both sides political activitiesedit in  mcpeak served as oregon state chairman for

by secdef dick cheney for illtimed and inappropriate comments to the news media regarding iraq during operation desert shield mcpeak took over as chief of staff during the runup for operation desert shield and assisted in overall strategic planning for operation desert storm his later tenure as csaf following the gulf war also saw a major reduction in force rif in terms of aircraft units officers and enlisted airmen across the entire air force as a result of the end of the cold war during his time as chief of staff he oversaw the disestablishment of strategic air command sac tactical air

atc and air university au into the air education and training command aetc mcpeak pushed through major organizational changes in the air force aimed at streamlining and emphasizing operations and combat readiness much of his tenure focused on elevating the status of flight operations especially singleseat fighter pilots some say at the expense of multiseat fighter bomber and reconnaissance aircraft and personnel cargo and air refueling aircraft and personnel and nonflying career fields he also created the air force expeditionary wing concept a fusion of combat forces and support into a single organization he also transferred several flying wing and space wing command billets to brigadier generals even though previously these had been commanded by colonels however mcpeak is best remembered by many current and sinceretired senior air force personnel for the sweeping changes he made to the air forces service dress uniform especially for commissioned officers worn by more personnel during most duties the new version was a radical departure from the earlier version which was essentially the same design as the thenus army service uniform the us air force was originally the us army air corps and then the us army air forces but with fewer insignia because of the new uniforms resemblance to both commissioned officers uniforms of the us navy and those of commercial airline pilots the mcpeak uniform was said to be unpopular with air force service members these uniform changes were subsequently reversed by his successor the basic redesign continues to be worn to this day but the navalized sleeve braid rank insignia for officers was eliminated and name tags reinstituted albeit in silver metal versus the blue plastic nametags worn with the earlier uniform with the blue plastic nametags still worn on service uniform shirts mcpeaks original concept of simplifying and toning down the various devices and insignia pinned to the uniform has gone by the wayside with nearly all usaf personnel wearing at least one if not two three or more metal insignia with their dress uniforms mcpeak also acted as secretary of the air force for three weeks in  during an interim before the formal appointment and confirmation of sheila e widnall as of that date becoming the only person to have ever concurrently served in both capacities mcpeak continued as chief of staff through october  retiring afterwards mcpeaks legacy as chief of staff has been considered in several quarters as one of the most controversial in us air force history and has been the subject of much debate many air force senior officers and senior enlisted personnel both active and retired from the regular air force the air force reserve and the air national guard have accused him of trying to run the air force as a corporation with his introduction of total quality management tqm under the moniker of quality air force qaf as well as the uniform changes he unilaterally implemented which strayed from a traditional landbased military style some of his uniform changes were soon undone after his retirement by his successor as usaf chief of staff rightly or wrongly mcpeak was also often accused of ignoring the needs of enlisted personnel nonflying officers aeronauticallyrated navigator officers and looking out solely for his officers who were pilots primarily singleseat fighter pilots there was even debate over the somewhat traditional act of inducting him as the outgoing chief of staff into the order of the sword some of this controversy may also be traced at least in part to the abrupt manner in which general mcpeak had replaced general michael dugan as chief of staff of the air force general dugan a popular and wellintentioned officer had sought to repair the air forces image badly frayed by the services withholding of embarrassing information about the performance of the f nighthawk during the invasion of panama dugan had also sought to make top air force officials more accessible but he was relieved of command by thensecretary of defense dick cheney shortly before the start of operation desert storm and the first gulf war following some intemperate remarks dugan had made to the news media about targeting iraqi leader saddam hussein under united nations security council resolution  prior to the start of hostilities this despite the fact that as air force chief of staff dugan had no command authority within the us central command theater of operations in short order cheney quickly replaced dugan with mcpeak as chief of staff although dugan was retained as a star special advisor by the secretary of defense until dugans retirement from the air force later workedit following his air force career mcpeak entered the private sector as a

by secdef dick cheney for illtimed and inappropriate comments to the news media regarding iraq during operation desert shield mcpeak took over as chief of staff during the runup for operation desert shield and assisted in overall strategic planning for operation desert storm his later tenure as csaf following the gulf war also saw a major reduction in force rif in terms of aircraft units officers and enlisted airmen across the entire air force as a result of the end of the cold war during his time as chief of staff he oversaw the disestablishment of strategic air command sac tactical air command tac military airlift command mac air force systems command afsc air force logistics command aflc and air force communications command afcc with assets transferred primarily to the newlyestablished air combat command acc air mobility command amc air force materiel command afmcand the thenair force communications agency his tenure also oversaw the merging of air training command atc and air university au into the air education and training command aetc mcpeak pushed through major organizational changes in the air force aimed at streamlining and emphasizing operations and combat readiness much of his tenure focused on elevating the status of flight operations especially singleseat fighter pilots some say at the expense of multiseat fighter bomber and reconnaissance aircraft and personnel cargo and air refueling aircraft and personnel and nonflying career fields he also created the air force expeditionary wing concept a fusion of combat forces and support into a single organization he also transferred several flying wing and space wing command billets to brigadier generals even though previously these had been commanded by colonels however mcpeak is best remembered by many current and sinceretired senior air force personnel for the sweeping changes he made to the air forces service dress uniform especially for commissioned officers worn by more personnel during most duties the new version was a radical departure from the earlier version which was essentially the same design as the thenus army service uniform the us air force was originally the us army air corps and then the us army air forces but with fewer insignia because of the new uniforms resemblance to both commissioned officers uniforms of the us navy and those of commercial airline pilots the mcpeak uniform was said to be unpopular with air force service members these uniform changes were subsequently reversed by his successor the basic redesign continues to be worn to this day but the navalized sleeve braid rank insignia for officers was eliminated and name tags reinstituted albeit in silver metal versus the blue plastic nametags worn with the earlier uniform with the blue plastic nametags still worn on service uniform shirts mcpeaks original concept of simplifying and toning down the various devices and insignia pinned to the uniform has gone by the wayside with nearly all usaf personnel wearing at least one if not two three or more metal insignia with their dress uniforms mcpeak also acted as secretary of the air force for three weeks in  during an interim before the formal appointment and confirmation of sheila e widnall as of that date becoming the only person to have ever concurrently served in both capacities mcpeak continued as chief of staff through october  retiring afterwards mcpeaks legacy as chief of staff has been considered in several quarters as one of the most controversial in us air force history and has been the subject of much debate many air force senior officers and senior enlisted personnel both active and retired from the regular air force the air force reserve and the air national guard have accused him of trying to run the air force as a corporation with his introduction of total quality management tqm under the moniker of quality air force qaf as well as the uniform changes he unilaterally implemented which strayed from a traditional landbased military style some of his uniform changes were soon undone after his retirement by his successor as usaf chief of staff rightly or wrongly mcpeak was also often accused of ignoring the needs of enlisted personnel nonflying officers aeronauticallyrated navigator officers and looking out solely for his officers who were pilots primarily singleseat fighter pilots there was even debate over the somewhat traditional act of inducting him as the outgoing chief of staff into the order of the sword some of this controversy may also be traced at least in part to the abrupt manner in which general mcpeak had replaced general michael dugan as chief of staff of the air force general dugan a popular and wellintentioned officer had sought to repair the air forces image badly frayed by the services withholding of embarrassing information about the performance of the f nighthawk during the invasion of panama dugan had also sought to make top air force officials more accessible but he was relieved of command by thensecretary of defense dick cheney shortly before the start of operation desert storm and the first gulf war following some intemperate remarks dugan had made to the news media about targeting iraqi leader saddam hussein under united nations security council resolution  prior to the start of hostilities this despite the fact that as air force chief of staff dugan had no command authority within the us central command theater of operations in short order cheney quickly replaced dugan with mcpeak as chief of staff although dugan was retained as a star special advisor by the secretary of defense until dugans retirement from the air force later workedit following his air force career mcpeak entered the private sector as a consultant and business executive he has been on the boards of directors for twa ecc international where he served for several years as chairman tektronix sensis corporation gencorps and other corporations mcpeak and his wife elynor currently reside in lake oswego oregon she served as a member of the lake oswego city council mcpeak was appointed in july  to the american battle monuments commission he is the tenth chairman and the first airman to lead the commission in  san diego state university gave its first ever lifetime achievement award to general mcpeak in  george washington university honored him with its distinguished alumni award the george in  on the occasion of the th anniversary of the founding of sigma chi fraternity he was selected as one of  members of its hall of fame he was among the initial seven inductees to the oregon aviation hall of honor in may  mcpeak published hangar flying the first volume of the aerial view trilogy three memoirs that will document his career in the air force the book was followed by volume  below the zone in november  israeledit mcpeak was harshly criticized by american spectator journalist robert goldberg for comments and writings he has made regarding israel goldberg begins the piece saying that mcpeak has a long history of criticizing israel for not going back to the  borders as part of any peace agreement with arab states in  mcpeak wrote an article for foreign affairs magazine questioning israels insistence on holding on to the golan heights and parts of the west bank goldberg writes that in recent years mcpeak has echoed the mearsheimerwalt view that american middle east policy is being controlled by jews at the expense of americas interests in the region goldberg then quotes mcpeak responding to a question as to what is the cause for the lack of progressing in getting israelis and palestinians together new york city miami we have a large vote  vote here in favor of israel and no politician wants to run against it goldberg also wrote that mcpeak claims that a combination of jews and christian zionists are manipulating us policy in iraq in dangerous and radical ways to support this claim goldberg quotes mcpeak from a published interview lets say that one of your abiding concerns is the security of israel as opposed to a purely american selfinterest then it would make sense to build a dozen or so bases in iraq lets say you are a bornagain christian and you think that armageddon and the rapture are about to happen any minute and what you want to do is retrace steps you think are laid out in revelations then it makes sense so there are a number of scenarios here that could lead you in this direction this is radical mcpeaks responseedit more than  years ago  i wrote and foreign affairs published an article now being circulated in the blogosphere as evidence of an alleged antiisrael point of view some commentators reach farther suggesting that since i have been an active supporter of barack obamas presidential bid he too is antiisrael both these assertions fall flat after any objective reading of the historical record i am a longtime admirer and think myself a friend of israel in the early s i played a key role in getting advanced weaponry released to the israeli air force  capabilities it later put to active use during that period i made many official visits to israel and established close relationships there these contacts turned out to be useful during operation desert storm when as chief of staff of the us air force i worked with my israeli counterparts to help defend israel from iraqi scud missile attacks i was a vocal opponent of the george w bush administrations decision to invade iraq a strategic blunder made worse by slapdash execution as we have seen this starcrossed action took our eye off the ball in afghanistan breathed new life into a moribund al qaeda and enhanced iranian influence in this critical region  all outcomes which damaged both the united states and our ally israel it is my view and hope that israel will have our continued support i wish it every success of course what israel regards as success is up to it to decide but for friends like me success means a secure israel at peace with neighbors who recognize and respect its existence even so we should maintain our special relationship and help israel keep its qualitative military edge as for the article much has changed in  years and much has not the essential argument holds no set of realistically achievable geographic borders produces safety for israel rather the security requirement is that any of the territory taken in the sixday war and given back as part of a peace settlement should be effectively demilitarized of course the sinai peninsula was returned to egypt long ago in exactly this way resulting in relative quiet along israels southern border and creating a fundamental shift in the regional balance of forces this opportunity was not skillfully exploited so the result has been a cold peace but it is nevertheless peace and has served the interests of both sides political activitiesedit in  mcpeak served as oregon state chairman for the bob dole for president campaign during the presidential election of  mcpeak endorsed george w bush and served as cochairman of oregon veterans for bush as the military and foreign policy of the bush administration coalesced however mcpeak expressed strong objections especially with regard to the  invasion of iraq mcpeak later openly campaigned for howard deans nomination and when dean withdrew acted as an adviser for the john kerry campaign he was also one of twentyseven signatories to the statement of the committee of diplomats  commanders for change calling the bush administration a failure at preserving national security and calling for bush not to be reelectedcitation needed mcpeak was a cochair of barack obamas  presidential campaign he generated controversy following comments he made at a campaign appearance in medford oregon where he implied that former president bill clinton had appeared to question obamas patriotism as one who for  years proudly wore the uniform of our country im saddened to see a president employ these tactics he of all people should know better because he was the target of exactly the same kind of tactics mcpeak also compared the former presidents comments to mccarthyism i grew up i was going to college when joe mccarthy was accusing good americans of being traitors so ive had enough of it east timoredit according to

reduction in force as a result of the end of the cold war during his time as chief of staff he oversaw the disbandment of strategic air command air force systems command and air force communications command with assets transferred primarily to air combat command air mobility command air force materiel command and the air force communications agency mcpeak pushed through major organizational change aimed at streamlining and emphasizing operations and combat readiness much of his tenure focused on elevating the status of flight operations some say at the expense of support or nonflying career fields he also created the air force expeditionary wing concept a fusion of combat forces and support into a single organization he also transferred several command billets to brigadier generals even though previously these had been commanded by colonels however he is best remembered by many air force personnel for the sweeping changes made to the service dress uniformcitation needed worn by more personnel during most duties the new version was a radical departure from the earlier version which was essentially the same as the us army service uniform the us air force was originally the us army air corps because of its resemblance to both naval officers uniforms and those of airline pilots the mcpeak uniform was said to be unpopular with service members however the basic redesign continues to be worn to this day although mcpeaks original concept of simplifying and toning down the various devices and gadgets pinned to the uniform has gone by the way mcpeak also acted as secretary of the air force for three weeks in  during an interim before the formal appointment and confirmation of sheila e widnall as of that date becoming the only person to have ever concurrently served in both capacities mcpeak continued as chief of staff through october  retiring afterwards   postmilitary career following his air force career mcpeak entered the private sector as a consultant

for president campaign during the presidential election of  mcpeak endorsed george w bush and served as cochairman of oregon veterans for bush as the military and foreign policy of the bush administration coalesced however mcpeak expressed strong objections especially with regard to the  invasion of iraq mcpeak later openly campaigned for howard deans nomination and when dean withdrew acted as an adviser for the john kerry campaign he was also one of twentyseven signatories to the statement of the committee of diplomats  commanders for change calling the bush administration a failure at preserving national security and calling for bush not to be reelectedcitation needed mcpeak worked as a cochair on barack obamas presidential campaign during the  united states presidential election which was a very big mistake in retrospect mcpeak was appointed in july  to the american battle monuments commission in may  mcpeak published hangar flying the first volume of the aerial view trilogy three memoirs that will document his career in the air force   current events this articles criticism or controversy section may compromise the articles neutral point of view of the subject please integrate the sections contents into the article as a whole or rewrite the material may    israel mcpeak was harshly criticized by american spectator journalist robert goldberg for comments and writings he has made regarding israel goldberg begins the piece saying that mcpeak has a long history of criticizing israel for not going back to the  borders as part of any peace agreement with arab states in  mcpeak wrote an article for foreign affairs magazine questioning israels insistence on holding on to the golan heights and parts of the west bank goldberg writes that in recent years mcpeak has echoed the mearsheimerwalt view that american middle east policy is being controlled by jews at the expense of americas interests in the region goldberg then quotes mcpeak responding to a question as to what is the cause for the lack of progressing in getting israelis and palestinians together new york city miami we have a large vote  vote here in favor of israel and no politician wants to run against it goldberg also wrote that mcpeak claims that a combination of jews and christian zionists are manipulating us policy in iraq in dangerous and radical ways to support this claim goldberg quotes mcpeak from a published interview lets say that one of your abiding concerns is the security of israel as opposed to a purely american selfinterest then it would make sense to build a dozen or so bases in iraq lets say you are a bornagain christian and you think that armageddon and the rapture are about to happen any minute and what you want to do is retrace steps you think are laid out in revelations then it makes sense so there are a number of scenarios here that could lead you in this direction this is radical   mcpeaks response more than  years ago  i wrote a foreign affairs published an article now being circulated in the blogosphere as evidence of an alleged antiisrael point of view some commentators reach farther suggesting that since i have been an active supporter of barack obamas presidential bid he too is antiisrael both these assertions fall flat after any objective reading of the historical record i am a longtime admirer and think myself a friend of israel in the early s i played a key role in getting advanced weaponry released to the israeli air force  capabilities it later put to active use during that period i made many official visits to israel and established close relationships there these contacts turned out to be useful during operation desert storm when as chief of staff of the us air force i worked with my israeli counterparts to help defend israel from iraqi scud missile attacks i was a vocal opponent of the george w bush administrations decision to invade iraq a strategic blunder made worse by slapdash execution as we have seen this starcrossed action took our eye off the ball in afghanistan breathed new life into a moribund al qaeda and enhanced iranian influence in this critical region  all outcomes which damaged both the united states and our ally israel it is my view and hope that israel will have our continued support i wish it every success of course what israel regards as success is up to it to decide but for friends like me success means a secure israel at peace with neighbors who recognize and respect its existence even so we should maintain our special relationship and help israel keep its qualitative military edge as for the article much has changed in  years and much has not the essential argument holds no set of realistically achievable geographic borders produces safety for israel rather the security requirement is that any of the territory taken in the sixday war and given back as part of a peace settlement should be effectively demilitarized of course the sinai peninsula was returned to egypt long ago in exactly this way resulting in relative quiet along israels southern border and creating a fundamental shift in the regional balance of forces this opportunity was not skillfully exploited so the result has been a cold peace but it is nevertheless peace and has served the interests of both sides   former president clinton mcpeak also generated controversy following comments he made at a barack obama campaign appearance in medford oregon where he implied that former president bill clinton had appeared to question obamas patriotism as one who for  years proudly wore the uniform of our country im saddened to see a president employ these tactics he of all people should know better because he was the target of exactly the same kind of tactics mcpeak also compared the former presidents comments to actions by senator joe mccarthy i grew up i was going to college when joe mccarthy was accusing good americans of being traitors so ive had enough of it   east timor according to journalist allan nairn general mcpeak oversaw the delivery of advanced us fighter planes to suhartos government not long after the november  shooting of proindependence demonstrators known as the dili massacre   dates of rank dates of rank insignia rank date gen aug   lt gen may   maj gen oct   brig gen july   col april   lt col nov   maj may   capt oct   st lt may   nd lt june
