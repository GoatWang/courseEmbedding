key tronic corp v united states  elr   environmental law reporter  copyright    all rights reserved key tronic corp v united statesno csjlq  f supp   erc  ed wash march   amended august  the court holds that a private party may recover prejudgment interest and attorneys fees under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla from the united states the court first holds that cercla §  waives the federal governments sovereign immunity to an award of prejudgment interest on cercla response costs although §  does not explicitly mention prejudgment interest it expressly waives the federal governments sovereign immunity to §  liability and cercla §  states that prejudgment interest is recoverable in cost recovery actions the court next holds that private parties may recover attorneys fees as part of a cercla §  cost recovery claim cercla should be construed liberally to permit recovery of costs associated with indentifying potentially responsible parties prps and to force responsible parties to pay their fair share of cleanup costs the court holds that a private party can incur enforcement costs under cercla and thus may recover attorneys fees for bringing a §  cost recovery action the court also holds that plaintiff may recover its costs in searching for prps and in negotiating a consent decree with the united states counsel for plaintiff james r moore mark w schneider perkins cole  rd ave th fl seattle wa    gregory t costello riddell williams  th ave plaza ste  seattle wa    counsel for defendants stephanie johnson us attorneys

chief judge order re plaintiffs motions for summary judgment before the court is defendant united states motion for enlargement of time ctrec  the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment re contribution claim ctrec  the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment that alumax is a covered person ctrec  the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment that response costs are recoverable ctrec  and defendant united states motion to stay ctrec  heard with oral argument on march   mark schneider and kathryn tucker represented the plaintiff leslie nellermoe and william maer represented defendant alumax eileen mcdonough represented the united states air force having reviewed the record heard from counsel and fully considered these matters the court enters this order to memorialize its oral rulings on these motions factual background from  to  spokane county maintained the colbert disposal site colbert in spokane county washington from the early s through  the county contracted to have defendant william schmidt do the work necessary to construct improve and complete the landfill in that capacity schmidt accepted and disposed of refuse at colbert key tronic alleges that between  and  schmidt accepted liquid chemicals from the united states air force usaf alumax fabricated products inc and alumax mill products inc hereafter collectively alumax and key tronic corporation and therefore that key tronic is entitled to contribution and cost recovery from the usaf and alumax for monies it paid and expended under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla  usc §  et seq in  drinking water wells around colbert were found to be contaminated by various chemicals including tca and tce it is not disputed that key tronic had deposited such materials at colbert key tronic alleges that it incurred at its own initiative expenses totaling   responding to that discovery key tronic subsequently entered into a consent decree and scope of work statement with the washington department of ecology doe and the united states environmental protection agency epa as part of that decree key tronic agreed to pay   million in cleanup costs the air force also entered into a consent decree with doe and epa in which the air force agreed to pay epa   million to resolve its liabilities with the epa for the colbert cleanup on august   the court entered an order ctrec  relating to the parties motions for summary judgment the court dismissed key tronics contribution claims against the usaf relating to key tronics   million in liability from the consent decree however the court did not dismiss key tronics claim against the usaf for contribution relating to the   million incurred independently by key tronic the court granted in part key tronics motion for partial summary judgment against the usaf and held that key tronic had established cercla liability against the air force the court denied key tronics motion for summary judgment against alumax and held that key tronic had not met its burden of proof in establishing that there was no triable issue of fact as to alumaxs liability under cercla the court dismissed the claims against defendant schmidt the united states and key tronic subsequently negotiated a consent decree which was signed by this court on january   see ctrec  the consent decree resolved all but the following issues of response cost liability between the united states and key tronic a costs and fees incurred by attorneys and investigators for key tronic in the amount of   during key tronics search for additional potentially responsible parties and costs and fees incurred by attorneys related to the negotiation of the consent decree between key tronic the united states and the state of washington in the state of washington v county of spokane csrjm b the salary of david powers key tronics general counsel and secretary in the amount of   for time spent supervising the search for additional potentially responsible parties and negotiating the consent decree identified in a c attorneys fees and costs incurred by key tronic in the prosecution of this action and d prejudgment interest on excepted claims ctrec  pp  key tronic now brings the following motions for summary judgment first key tronic moves for summary judgment that its   million in liability from the consent decree constitutes recoverable monies under cercla section   usc §  for purposes of its contribution claim against alumax second key tronic moves for summary judgment that alumax disposed of hazardous wastes at the colbert landfill third key tronic moves for summary judgment that its independent response costs of   million are recoverable under cercla at oral argument the plaintiff and defendant alumax informed the court that all claims against defendant alumax had been settled and therefore that oral argument on the motions as they related to alumax was unnecessary the plaintiff and defendant united states informed the court that should the court rule against the united states they had stipulated to the quantum of liability and that they would subsequently submit that stipulation to the court discussion i motions directed solely against defendant alumax because of the settlement between key tronic and alumax two of key tronics motions have been mooted therefore key tronics motion that the   million consent decree is recoverable under cercla for contribution purposes and key tronics motion that alumax is a covered person under cercla are hereby denied as moot ii recoverability of response costs key tronic moves this court to hold that monies it spent independently of the consent decree are recoverable under cercla as response costs by the january  consent decree between key tronic and the air force key tronic has waived all claims against the united states except for the four items contested because key tronic has settled its claims with alumax these excepted items are the sole remaining claims at issue key tronic contends the following claims are recoverable from the air force under cercla as response costs  prejudgment interest for any liability assessed against the usaf from these motions  attorneys fees for prosecuting this action  attorneys and investigators fees and opportunity costs of key tronics executive resulting from the search for other potentially responsible parties and  attorneys fees and opportunity costs of key tronics executive related to the negotiation of the consent decree a prejudgment interest against the usaf cercla waives sovereign immunity with the following statutory provision  elr  application of act to federal government  in general each department agency and instrumentality of the united states including the executive legislative and judicial branches of government shall be subject to and comply with this act in the same manner and to the same extent both procedurally and substantively as any nongovernmental entity including liability under section  of this act  usc § a cercla also provides that prejudgment interest in cost recovery actions is available the amounts recoverable in an action under this section shall include interest on the amounts recoverable under the preceding paragraphs  usc §  based on the foregoing provisions key tronic contends that prejudgment interest may be awarded against the united states government the government asserts that prejudgment interest may not be awarded against it for sovereign immunity reasons absent express congressional consent to the award of interest in addition to a general waiver of immunity to suit the united states is immune from an interest award library of congress v shaw  us   s ct   l ed d   the government contends that cercla does not contain an express waiver of immunity from prejudgment interest as required by shaw and the general waiver of liability despite its reference to section  of cercla is legally inadequate to award prejudgment interest the court finds the governments argument to be unpersuasive shaw involved a statute which provided that the united states shall be liable for costs as a private individual the statute in shaw did not make any reference to prejudgment interest the face of  usc §  makes quite clear that congress waived its sovereign immunity and intended for the government to be treated as any other private defendant cercla clearly states that in cost recovery actions under §  the plaintiff may recover prejudgment interest thus this court holds that cercla allows prejudgment interest as an element of damages against the united states b attorneys fees for prosecuting this action attorneys fees may not be recovered without a specific statutory provision allowing such a recovery alyeska pipeline co v wilderness society  us    s ct    l ed d   cercla does not have a provision which specifically states that enabling plaintiff is entitled to recover attorneys fees liability of responsible parties under §  includes the necessary costs of response resulting from a hazardous waste release or threatened release  usc §  in the definitions section respond or response means remove removal remedy and remedial action all such terms including the terms removal and remedial action include enforcement activities related thereto emphasis supplied  usc §  cercla does not define enforcement or enforcement activity cercla permits citizens who sue under the citizens suit provision  usc §  to obtain relief from a district court the court may not award money damages but may grant such relief in order to correct the violations and may impose civil penalties the court may award to the prevailing party the costs of litigation including attorneys fees  usc § f cercla provides special recovery measures for the united states government section  permits the united states to mover all removal or remedial costs incurred which are not inconsistent with the national contingency plan removal costs are defined as including any actions taken under section b of the act  usc §  section b permits the government to incur legal costs and to recover those costs  usc § b case law establishes that the united states may recover its litigation costs under cercla united states v northeastern pharmaceutical  chemical co  f supp   wdmo affd in part and revd in part  fd  th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   united states v south carolina recycling  disposal inc  f supp   dsc  affd in part and vacated in part  fd  th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   key tronic asserts that it is entitled to its legal fees because the attorneys fees required to bring this §  cost recovery action are enforcement costs recoverable as a necessary response cost key tronic first cites two cases in which the ninth circuit characterized a section  cost recovery claim by a private party as a private enforcement action cadillac fairview inc v dow chemical co  fd   th cir wickland oil terminals v asarco inc  fd   th cir from these cases key tronic contends that the recovery of attorneys fees through the enforcement cost language has already been resolved however the ninth circuits characterization of the cost recovery action appears to be dicta as the holdings of those cases did not turn upon the enforcement action language some courts addressing this issue have held that attorneys fees are recoverable for example in general electric co v litton industrial automation systems inc  fd  th cir the eighth circuit held that a private party bringing a cost recovery action under §  could recover attorneys fees for bringing the action in that case general electric purchased a piece of land on which litton had previously dumped toxic wastes ge entered into a settlement agreement with the state authorities agreed to clean up the waste site and subsequently sued litton for its response costs pursuant to section  of cercla in holding that attorneys fees were recoverable the court gave the following rationale cercla defines response as remove removal remedy and remedial action all such terms including the terms removal and remedial action include enforcement activities related thereto a private party costrecovery action such as this one is an enforcement activity within the meaning of the statute attorney fees and expenses necessarily are incurred in this kind of enforcement activity and it would strain the statutory language to the breaking point to read them out of the necessary costs that section ab allows private parties to recover we therefore conclude that cercla authorizes with a sufficient degree of explicitness the recovery by private parties of attorney fees and expenses this conclusion based on the statutory language is consistent with two of the main purposes of cercla — prompt cleanup of hazardous waste sites and imposition of all cleanup costs on the responsible party these purposes would be undermined if a nonpolluter such as ge were forced to absorb the litigation costs of recovering its response costs from the polluter the litigation costs could easily approach or even exceed the response costs thereby serving as a disincentive to clean the site citations omitted  fd at  two district courts have reached the same result with similar reasoning pease  curren refining inc v spectrolab inc  f supp  cdcal  shapiro v alexanderson  f supp   sdny other district courts have held that attorneys fees are not recoverable under cercla united states v hardage  f supp   wdokla fallowfield development corp v strunk  westlaw   edpa  mesiti v microdot inc  f supp   dnh regan v cherry corp  f supp  dri t  e indus inc v safety light corp  f supp   dnj bcw associates v occidental chemical corp  westlaw   edpa hemingway transportation inc v khan  br   bkrtcydmass  one of the leading cases for this position is t  e indus inc v safety light corp supra like the facts in litton t  e unknowingly purchased property with a hazardous waste site t  e sued safety light a successor to the original polluter for both its cleanup costs and attorneys fees as response costs the court held that cercla generally intended to distinguish between costs recoverable to the government and those recoverable by private entities id at  the court found that while the government could obtain attorneys fees pursuant to § b private parties had no comparable entitlement id without further explanation the court rejected the plaintiffs argument that attorneys fees for bringing the action were recoverable as enforcement activities related to response expenditures on the basis that private parties cannot incur enforcement costs id at  n   elr  another court rejecting attorneys fees in costrecovery actions emphasized the legislative history related to the amendment to the act which added the enforcement activities thereto language fallowfield development corp v strunk  westlaw   edpa the committee on energy and commerce had made the following comments on §  the section also modifies the definition of response action to include related enforcement activities the change will confirm the epas authority to recover costs for enforcement actions taken against responsible parties hrrep no  th cong st sess pt  at   reprinted in  us code cong  adminnews   from that language the court concluded that when congress expanded the definition of response costs to include enforcement costs congress did not intend for private parties to obtain attorneys fees as part of a cost recovery action fallowfield  westlaw  at  in this case the government contends that cerclas statutory scheme taken as a whole evidences a congressional intent to provide attorneys fees for the government but not for private parties first the government points out that cercla does not explicitly authorize attorneys fees as part of a §  costrecovery claim in contrast congress explicitly provided for attorneys fees for citizens suits  usc §  and for response actions by the united states  usc §  the government argues therefore that when congress wanted to provide for attorneys fees it did so explicitly and the failure to make such a provision in §  demonstrates the congressional intent to deny attorneys fees under section  the government further asserts that the statute taken as a whole shows that only the government may bring an enforcement action the government asserts that an enforcement action is a an action to compel compliance with cercla the united states may bring such an action under §  or §  and private citizens under §  but private parties may only bring contribution actions under §  or cost recovery claims under §  the government also relies upon the two sentences of the legislative history cited by the fallowfield court thus the government contends that even if the court rejects the governments argument that attorneys fees are unavailable because of a lack of explicit statutory authority under §  attorneys fees are nevertheless unrecoverable because a private party cannot incur costs of enforcement activities the court rejects both of the governments contentions as an initial matter cercla is essentially a remedial statute designed by congress to protect and preserve public health and the environment courts are obligated to construe its provisions liberally to avoid frustration of the beneficial legislative purposes in the absence of a specific congressional intent otherwise wilshire westwood assoc v atlantic richfield  fd   th cir quoting dedham water co v cumberland farms dairy inc  fd   st cir congress intended that those responsible for problems caused by the disposal of chemical poisons bear the cost and responsibility for remedying the harmful conditions they created pinole point properties v bethlehem steel corp  f supp   ndcal  quoting united states v reilly tar  chemical corp  f supp  dminn thus absent specific congressional intent to the contrary cercla should be interpreted liberally to permit recovery associated with identifying of potentially responsible parties and forcing those responsible parties to share their fair portion of the cleanup of a hazardous waste site the court must reject the governments express statutory authorization argument alyeska supra stood for the proposition that the federal courts may not award attorneys fees in the complete absence of any statutory authority  us at   s ct at  in that case the court of appeals had found that the case did not fit into any of the recognized exceptions to the american rule but nevertheless awarded attorneys fees because the litigation had been beneficial to the public and had ensured that the governmental system functioned properly id at   s ct at  the supreme court held that a judicially created rule awarding attorneys fees was improper and therefore reversed the decision by the court of appeals id at   s ct at  unlike alyeska the plaintiff in this case points to a statutory provision which entitles the recovery of all necessary response costs the statute defines response costs as including enforcement activities  usc §  thus the issue for the court is only whether a private party can incur enforcement costs the court finds that a private party may incur enforcement costs and therefore may recover attorneys fees for bringing a cost recovery action under §  congress drafted section  to establish the scope of response costs recoverable throughout cercla thus the definition of response on its face applies to both the government and private parties congress failed to restrict enforcement activities in that definition to governmental actions although the court acknowledges the force of the governments position that the statutory scheme implies that enforcement activities are those actions taken by the epa to require compliance with cercla the court must construe the provisions of §  and §  liberally to achieve the overall objectives of the statute the court further finds that the cases cited infra p  are more persuasive read as a whole the statute clearly meant for those responsible for dumping chemical wastes to pay for the cleanup of those wastes if the court narrowly read the statute as the government suggests then even innocent purchasers of property who clean up hazardous wastes and subsequently seek recovery from the responsible parties would be unable to recover the entirety of the expenses incurred in holding the responsible parties accountable for their pollution accordingly the court concludes that enforcement costs must be read broadly and thus includes therein attorneys fees for making responsible parties share necessary response costs c prp search costs key tronic also seeks to recover the costs of its executive outside investigators fees and attorneys fees relating to the search for potentially responsible parties the government acknowledges that prp search costs are recoverable when sought by the epa when enforcing cercla both parties acknowledge that the case law does not specifically discuss a private partys prp search costs the court finds its holding on enforcement activities and expenses recoverable thereunder to be applicable having held that the enforcement cost language of cercla must be read broadly this court concludes that the search for responsible parties is an enforcement activity within the meaning of cercla for the reasons art articulated by the court in permitting the recovery of the attorneys fees in bringing this legal action the court must find the prp search costs to be recoverable d costs incurred by key tronics attorneys and executive in negotiation of the consent decree courts have held that consultant and legal fees incurred in the investigation of a hazardous waste site are recoverable as necessary response costs international clinical laboratories inc v stevens  westlaw   us dist lexis  edny bcw associated v occidental chem corp  westlaw   us dist lexis  the court finds that the attorneys fees and executives opportunity costs in negotiating key tronics consent decree are necessary response costs in cleaning up the colbert landfill the court cannot accept the governments argument that such costs are not recoverable solely because attorneys as opposed to engineers carried out work necessary to solving the problems at colbert the court further notes that the government does not contend that these fees are recoverable only as enforcement activities because these expenses were necessary  elr  response costs the court finds that these costs are recoverable under cercla motion to stay the united states moves the court stay its decision on the quantum of damages the parties having represented that they will submit a stipulation as to the amount of damages the defendants motion is hereby denied as moot the parties shall submit their stipulation to the court within  days of the entry of this order it is hereby ordered  defendant united states motion for enlargement of time ctrec  is hereby granted  the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment re contribution claim ctrec  against defendant alumax is hereby denied as moot  the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment that alumax is a covered person ctrec  is hereby denied as moot  the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment that response costs are recoverable ctrec  is hereby granted as herein stated within  days of the entry of this order the plaintiff and defendant united states shall submit their stipulation as to the quantum of liability  defendant united states motion to stay ctrec  is hereby denied as moot it is so ordered  because the parties have stipulated to the quantum of liability for these items the court will address solely the legal issue of recoverability of these items  the court notes that the two sentences of legislative history cited by the government fail to make any reference to private parties the court cannot conclude from these statements that congress intended to deny recovery to private parties for enforcement activities  the court is not persuaded that litton should be read as a cleanhands case if enforcement costs were read to cover only the governments expenses in compelling compliance with the statute then persons with clean hands who bring cost recovery actions would also be denied a statutory mechanism to recover their attorneys fees the court cannot find a statutory basis to justify an analytical distinction between those who have clean hands and bring a cost recovery action and those who do not  indeed key tronic asserts and the government does not refute that key tronics efforts in identifying responsible parties and establishing the air forces disposal of wastes at colbert resulted in the epas action against the air force  the government did not raise the issue of whether key tronic might have been foreclosed from recovering attorneys fees related to obtaining a consent decree for the same reasons that key tronic may not seek contribution for the   million liability of the consent decree the government instead has defended solely on the basis that key tronics attorneys fees are not response costs  elr   environmental law reporter  copyright    all rights reserved   microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in
