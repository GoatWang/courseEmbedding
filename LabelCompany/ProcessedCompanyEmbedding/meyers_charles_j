highly skilled team of paralegals expert witnesses top financial consultants and medical professionals this team approach is what makes meyers  flowers stand out from the competition in that preparation is comprehensive and fast we understand that many our clients are not only suffering from a personal injury but are also having to deal with a reduction in income while we are headquartered in chicago we have successfully taken on big pharma and other international corporations that are responsible for injuries caused by their products we are considered a top chicago law firm because we are not intimidated by these giant corporations meyers  flowers have the internal resources to fully document the consequences of the injury to our client and to establish which entity must bear the burden of providing substantial and relevant compensation one of the services we provide to our clients is that of buffer between the incident response team of attorneys and our client offers to settle early in the negotiation process is a sign that the opposition hopes to avoid a trial and the much larger award that is likely to awarded by a jury at meyers  flowers we evaluate these offers against the needs of our client including future needs and advise accordingly taking on the role of advocate for our client means that we bear the brunt of the often aggressive negotiating that is done in these cases since our reputation for winning large awards and settlements for our clients is nationwide our negotiating power is considerable we have been successful due to

our clients to succeed against huge corporate litigation teams with unlimited finances and every reason to delay proceedings we are a powerful force fully focused on vigorously pursuing financial compensation for our clients who are dealing with life changing injuries or losses we enjoy the challenge of obtaining full compensation for our clients and their families this comes in part from operating with the knowledge that our adversaries are primarily focused on reducing the financial impact a proper financial award will have on their client’s financial statements one common tactic is to offer a settlement early on in the proceedings which appears fairly generous early offers of settlements are almost always far short of the true financial impact the injury and loss will have on our clients lives going forward these offers are made quickly to take advantage of the sudden financial and emotional stress that an injury or a death will have on a family understanding and countering the tactics employed by large corporations and institutions is one reason why we are considered among the best lawyers in chicago vigorous case preparation gets results client trust recognizing that our clients place their trust in us to resolve issues that have profound effects on their family our experienced team of some of the best attorneys in chicago do everything that we can to earn that trust by our vigorous advocacy of our clients interests throughout the entire process the attorneys at meyers  flowers possess the work ethic along with the detailed personal attention that is necessary to fully understand and win cases vigorous case preparation we prepare every case very aggressively pushing the other side to respond to our demands and effectively setting the stage for successful settlement negotiations part of our power stems from our stellar record of wins as well as our policy of preparing each case for trial regardless of the opposition’s assurances of impending settlement offers our expert accountants and lifestyle consultants fully understand the current and future needs of our clients who have endured physical or mental injuries due to negligence our topa trial attorneys are well versed in communicating these financial requirements clearly both in settlement negotiations and if necessary during trial in wrongful death cases we
