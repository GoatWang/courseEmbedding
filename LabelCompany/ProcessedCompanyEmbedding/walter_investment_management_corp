rates will benefit most of these investmentsi currently believe nrz is attractively priced at  per share as of  and is undervalued by  my current price target is stated in the “conclusions drawn” section of the articlefocus of article the focus of this article is to provide a detailed analysis on why new residential investment corp nrz is currently an attractive equity investment to own this article will first provide an analysis of nrz’s past and current economic return change in book value bv and dividends received over multiple time frames when compared to eighteen mortgage real estate investment trust mreit peers this article will then provide a detailed analysis of nrz’s investment portfolio due to the complexity and number of different types of investments held by nrz most investors do not “fully” understand these portfolios as such i believe a detailed analysisdiscussion is warranted and ties in rather well when trying to provide support regarding nrz’s current undervaluation this analysis will also explain why nrz unlike most of the company’s mreit peers will actually benefit from a rising interest rate environment when it comes to both income generation and net valuation fluctuations an important distinction to understand throughout the article various tables will be provided to support my viewpoints and assist readers in understanding nrz’s business operations my buy sell or hold recommendation and current price target for nrz will be in the “conclusions drawn” section of the article nrz’s economic return compared to eighteen mreit peers i believe one of the best metrics to provide readers when it comes to performance within the mreit sector is to compare a company’s economic return over multiple timeframesinterest rate movements this is one of many metrics that should be assessed when trying to determine if an mreit is overvalued or undervalued other factors include but are not limited to  future mbs price movements  percentage of “chargeoffs” impairment relative to a portfolio’s unpaid principal balance “upb”  current and future anticipated risk management strategies  future dividend sustainability  management expertise  relationship with business partners  management aligned with shareholders’ interests  anticipated movements of market interest rates and  macroeconomic factors i believe most would agree these factors will have varying degrees of influence on an mreit’s business operations which will directlyindirectly impact overall performance within my quarterly mreit comparison articles i typically provide readers with an analysis which compares various metrics one of the metrics i provide is a comparison of each mreit’s trailing twelvemonth economic return loss within this particular article i want to expand on this metric and provide readers with each mreit’s economic return loss over a longer timeframe i believe this will provide direct evidence nrz has continually outperformed most sector peers over the past several years to begin this analysis table  is provided below table  –mreit economic return loss analysis q  – q  source table created entirely by myself obtaining each company’s historical bv and dividend per share figures from the sec’s edgar database using table  above as a reference nrz had an economic return of  during  this takes into consideration nrz had a reverse  stock split during the year out of the nineteen mreit peers listed in table  nrz generated the highest economic return during  due to the fact nrz’s spinoff from drive shack inc ds formerly newcastle investment corp occurred on  economic return loss percentages for  are not provided in table  for interested readers nrz generated a minor economic return between  moving to  nrz had an annual economic return of  consistent with  out of the nineteen mreit peers within table  above nrz generated the highest economic return during  during  nrz generated an economic return of  for the third straight year nrz outperformed the eighteen mreit peers when it came to economic return finally during the first quarter of  nrz generated an economic return of  this was the third highest out of the nineteen mreit companies listed in table  simply put out the several sectors i cover here at seeking alpha i believe nrz’s overall performance from an economic return perspective has been the most dominant over the past several years when comparing sector peers as such i do not believe it is a coincidence nrz currently trades at the largest premium to bv when compared to the company’s mreit peers within this analysis so while i believe this analysis clearly shows nrz has been a “best of breed” stock when it comes to longterm sector performance including the fact several different interest rate scenarios occurred over the past  years the more important question to answer is whether the company can continue this outperformance in order to provide an answer to this question i believe it is necessary to provide readers with a detailed analysis of nrz’s investment portfolio analysis of nrz’s investment portfolio one key factor in determining if nrz is currently undervalued is to analyze the company’s investment portfolio depending on the movement of mortgage interest ratesus treasury yields some mreit companies will generally outperform most sector peers when certain characteristics are evident in the market i believe this applies to nrz due to the fact the company has a somewhat different strategy when compared to most of the mreit peers referenced earlier  mortgage servicing rights “msr” and excess msr portfolio to begin with an msr is a contractual agreement where the right to service a mortgage is transferred from a lender or existing servicer to a third party this third party services a pool of underlying mortgages for a small contractual fee typically an msr is comprised of the following two pieces  basic servicing fee and  excess msr an excess msr is the amount of cash flows that are left after an mbs’s coupon principal payment and basic servicing fee are accounted for what is unique about an excess msr is that the owner of this right receives the excess cash while not performing any servicing obligations since both types of investments are basically valued by the amount of the projected discounted cash flows of the underlying mbs including expected servicingexcess revenue msrs and excess msrs are impacted by variables such as conditional prepayment rates “cpr” weighted average loan age “wala” and credit risk nonperformance of an underlying loan including percentage of delinquencies to discuss nrz’s recent msr and excess msr portfolio table  is provided below table  – overview of nrz’s msr and excess msr portfolio source table obtained with added highlights from nrz’s quarterly shareholder presentation for the first quarter of  using the top portion of table  above as a reference nrz rapidly expanded the company’s msr and excess msr portfolio during the prior twoquarters for instance during nrz’s fourth quarter of  the company acquired msrs with an unpaid principal balance “upb” of    and  billion from phh walter investment management corp wac wco and first key respectively simply put these were notable purchases which quickly expanded nrz’s investment portfolio during nrz’s first quarter of  the company acquired msrs with an upb of    and  billion from citimortgage united shore residential credit solutions “rcs” and wac respectively simply put once again these were notable purchases which continued to rapidly expand nrz’s investment portfolio now using the bottom portion of table  as a reference nrz’s msr and excess msr portfolio consisted of a combination of underlying fannie mae otcqbfnma freddie mac otcqbfmcc ginnie mae and nonagency mbs there are several characteristics when comparing nrz’s agency and nonagency mbs first nrz’s underlying agency mbs typically have a lower wala a lower current loantovalue “ltv” indication of lower credit risk for the governmentsponsored enterpriseentity gse a higher fico score makes sense due to the fact the government is “on the hook” for any credit lossesdefaults and a notably lower delinquency rate as such nrz’s underlying nonagency mbs typically have a higher wala makes sense because of the private sector’s much larger role within the securitization market prior to the “financial crisis” a higher ltv a lower fico score and a notably higher delinquency rate now with that being said the underlying nonagency mbs typically have higher delinquencies due to the overall nature of these investments described in the traits listed above most nonagency mbs are considered “legacy”seasoned assets even with higher delinquency rates when compared to agency mbs nonagency mbs have a notably lower “cost basis” to compensate an investor into the riskier securitization as such if a certain nonagency mbs experiences only a minormodest default rate typically companies owning these securitizations will report attractive generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” incomeyields through the life of the investment discount accretion and typically notable capital gains due to the lowcost basis further discussion of this conceptstrategy is provided later in the article so in a rising interest rate environment nrz will experience enhanced cash flowsvaluations from the company’s msrsexcess msrs because underlying cpr percentages will decrease as prepayment risk decreases in addition if the underlying nonagency mbs experience decreasing delinquency rates which has been the general trend for nrz the company enhances its cash flowsgains simply put this is a notable positive catalysttrend to consider now with that being said there has been some concerns in regards to the “health” of several of nrz’s servicerssubservicers in particular this includes ocwen loan servicing llc ocn and ditech financial llc ditech who is a subsidiary of wac regarding these two companies the market has become worried about continued negative earnings per share “eps” and certain litigation costs especially when it comes to ocn the health of these servicerssubservicers could directly impact nrz’s future business operationsresults on  another wellrespected contributor here at seeking alpha asked my opinion in regards to this topic when it came to ditech the following question from this contributor was asked “are you concerned by their enormous exposure to ditech a subsidiary of wac im concerned wac might go belly up” at the time i provided the following response “…if wac does go into bankruptcy protection various ongoing litigation likely chapter  but could be  i believe they would sell their assetsrights even ditech as a whole “to the highest bidder” if it came to that this would likely be to one of the other servicers that nrz already has a relationship with andor nrz could even “take rights” of the portfolio…” in a nutshell this discussion surrounded the impact of a servicersubservicer going bankrupt this could be due to deteriorating operating performance andor insurmountable litigation costs stemmed from the ordinary course of business within the quote above and subsequent discussion that followed at the time i stated nrz would likely not allow this event to occur by either “propping up” the servicersubservicer through purchases of part or all of the underlying portfolio andor capital injections ownership stake while this conversation at the time was actually in reference to ditech these same general thoughtsstrategies were applicable to any of nrz’s servicerssubservicers low and behold almost immediately after this conversation on  there was news that ocn was served a “cease and desist” order from a north carolina bank commissioner subsequently other statesparties filled suit as well due to alleged servicing issues in particular consumer escrow accounts simply put these legal issues and potential audit would need to be paid forfunded by ocn at the time ocn was “strapped” for cash as the company publicly stated simply put speculation was rampant causing ocn’s stock price to notably decrease in value over a very short period of time with the quoted response above as support i believe it was no surprise on  nrz announced the company was purchasing some msrs from ocn for approximately  million to assist with the company’s litigation costscash flows in addition nrz confirmed ocn would be the subservicer of these investments for a period of five years to calm fears in the market via a longterm agreement furthermore nrz provided that “cash infusion” discussed earlier when the company announced it will take a  equity stake in ocn it would also appear nrz would continue to provide future capital injections as needed a backstop per se so basically what i stated in my quoted response prior to this event occurring actually came to fruition just a different servicersubservicer due to ocn’s small market capitalization approximately  million as of  i believe additional support by nrz to ocn canwill be performed as needed as such i do not see a disruption in servicerevenue streams when it comes to nrz’s relationship with its servicerssubservicers this is an important point to understand and should be viewed as a positive catalysttrend  servicer advances portfolio next servicer advances are typically reimbursable cash payments made by a servicer if a borrower’s mortgage payment is late or not paid at all generally speaking mortgage servicers are contractually obligated to advance the entire monthly payment amount to the investor if this event occurs these advances can also support collateral requirements if a borrower becomes current or the underlying property is soldforeclosed upon the servicer is then repaid all advanced funds simply put these advances provide comfort to an investor in this case nrz by increasing liquidity concerns to highlight nrz’s servicer advances portfolio table  is provided below table  – overview of nrz’s servicer advances portfolio source table obtained with added highlights from nrz’s quarterly shareholder presentation for the first quarter of  link provided below table  using table  above as a reference nrz’s servicer advances portfolio had a fair market value “fmv” balance of  billion as of  including the basic fee component of the related msrs this valuation is considered on an upb of  billion within this upb balance   and  billion were serviced by nationstar mortgage llc nsm ocn and specialized loan servicing llc “sls” respectively as a whole nrz’s servicer advances portfolio was valued at  of the upb of the underlying residential mbs “rmbs” side note for the remainder of the article the term “rmbs” and “mbs” refer to the same type of securitized holdings and will be used interchangeably what i want to specifically discuss when it comes to nrz’s servicer advances portfolio in a rising interest rate environment is the company’s debt financing for “securing” these assets as of  the face amount par value of the notesbonds payable for securing nrz’s servicer advances was  billion in addition these notesbonds payable had a net cost of funds rate of  now some market participants may believe this is currently a rather high cost of funds rate for a portfolio with a weighted average yield of  as of  however i believe a few points should be highlighted continuing to use table  as a reference as of  only  of the notesbonds payable securing nrz’s servicer advances portfolio had a maturity at or above two years these notesbonds payable had a weighted average maturity of  years a weighted average funding cost of  and a net cost of funds rate of  as of  now  of the notesbonds payable securing nrz’s servicer advances portfolio had a maturity at or above two years a notable change in addition these notesbonds payable now had a weighted average maturity of  years a weighted average funding cost of  and a net cost of funds rate of  as such nrz was able to “extend” the weighted average maturity of the company’s secured borrowings while also slightly lowering its cost of funds rate a decrease of approximately  basis points bps now some market participants might be concerned that an increase in mortgage interest ratesus treasury yields would cause an increase in nrz’s cost of funds rate however still using table  above as a reference nrz has also addressed this potential concern as of   of the notesbonds payable securing nrz’s servicer advances portfolio were “variablerate” loans as ratesyields rose in the future the interest rate associated with these loans would also increase and vice versa however as a  now only  of the notesbonds payable securing nrz’s servicer advances portfolio were variablerate loans as such  were now “fixedrate” in nature as ratesyields rise in the future the interest rate associated with these loans would remain unchanged as mortgage interest ratesus treasury yields net increase over the next several years in my opinion a fairly high probability nrz’s servicer advances portfolio will likely gradually increase its weighted average yield a function of higher coupons andor lower prepayment risk in addition nrz has increased the company’s weighted average maturity when it comes to its notesbonds payable while also “lockingin” attractive borrowing rates simply put this ultimately improves nrz’s operating performance through an increase in net interest income ultimately leads to an increase in taxable income helps dividend sustainability as such i believe this should be seen as another positive catalysttrend  agency and nonagency mbs portfolio in addition to nrz’s msr excess msr and servicer advances portfolio the company also invests in more “traditional” mreit holdings such as agency and nonagency mbs nrz mainly through the use of leverage acquires agency and nonagency rmbs which produce interest income based on the underlying coupon rate of each respective investment to fund the acquisition of agency and nonagency rmbs nrz enters into shortterm repurchase “repo” loan agreements nrz’s interest expense in relation to the company’s outstanding repo agreements is based on a small fixedrate percentage and a variablerate percentage based on the london interbank offered rate libor basically all of nrz’s agency and nonagency mbs are classified as “availableforsale “afs” real estate securities as such changes in valuations are reported through comprehensive income similar gaap treatment when compared to sector peers as of  approximately  and  of nrz’s mbs portfolio was agency and nonagency holdings respectively as of  nrz’s agency mbs portfolio held  different securitizations with a weighted average coupon “wac” of  a weighted average yield of  a weighted average life of  years and a fmv of  billion in comparison nrz’s nonagency mbs portfolio held  different securitizations with a wac of  takes into consideration nonperformance a weighted average yield of  a weighted average life of  years and a fmv of  billion when excluding certain assetbacked securities “abs” nrz’s nonagency mbs portfolio had a fmv of  billion due to the fact a majority of nrz’s mbs portfolio is concentrated in nonagency holdings including my extensive coverage of agency mbs characteristics including pricing in other mreit articles for instance agnc investment corp agnc cys investments inc cys annaly capital management inc nly and orchid island capital inc orc i want to specifically analyze the company’s nonagency mbs portfolio to begin this analysis table  is provided below table  – overview of nrz’s nonagency mbs portfolio source table obtained with added highlights from nrz’s quarterly shareholder presentation for the first quarter of  link provided below table  using table  above as a reference nrz purchased  billion of nonagency mbs based on parface value for  million original cost basis during the first quarter of  when calculated this was a purchase price of approximately  of the par value regarding these specific nonagency mbs simply put this was a notable discount to par which certainly classifies these investments as “distressed” however with that being said in some cases these distressed investments can provide great returns if there is an appropriate management teamstrategy in place part of the reason why nrz continues to outperform most if not all the company’s mreit peers including “multipurpose” mreits is due to the fact management is able to identifyspot specific deals with attractive riskadjusted returns as stated earlier in the article if management believes delinquencies andor cpr percentages can remain subdued purchasing distressed investments at discounted prices can lead to notable realizedcapital gains and provide attractive gaap accretive income over the estimated life of the securitizations continuing to use table  as a reference as of  nrz’s nonagency mbs holdings had a fmv equal to  of the parface value of the portfolio while having an adjusted cost basis of  simply put this is an attractive cost basis considering the recentcurrent environment when it comes to housing demand and the economy nrz’s nonagency mbs portfolio as a whole is performing “as expected” or even slightly better than anticipated fmv aboveadjusted cost basis while continuing to generate attractive gaap accretive income each quarter in addition this portfolio has experienced a gradual reduction in delinquencies these factors should be seen as a positive catalysttrend i also want to discuss nrz’s “call rights” when it comes to the company’s nonagency mbs portfolio as highlighted in table  above as of  nrz has the right to call approximately  of the portfolio at times there’s a notable difference between the value of certain investmentssecuritizations and the recoverable value of the underlying collateral in this case the value of residential houses when such a “decoupling” occurs it is typically to the investor’s advantage to “call” an investmentsecuritization to receive proceeds notably above the adjusted purchase price of the investmentsecuritization remaining upb versus adjusted cost basis nrz’s ability to exercise call rights on a majority of the company’s nonagency mbs portfolio is an important and positive catalysttrend to understand currently i believe the market has not fully “priced in” this important distinction now with that being said it was recently announced that wells fargo  company wfc acting as trustee for certain nonagency mbs withheld more than  million due to investors initiated by nrz’s exercise of the company’s call rights to cover certain legal costs pertaining to the financial crisis this has recently caused some “ripples” within the nonagency mbs market which resulted in a shortterm price drop simply put investors were “spooked” by this event which has caused some illiquidity within this specific market approximately  per loan was held back by wfc to cover legal costs on plaintiffs’ claims original investors of the securitizations stemming back to the financial crisis most of this pertains to loans that were securitized and sold back in  which were originated by bank of america corp bac wfc has withheld a small amount per loan to cover any ongoing legal costs being the trusteedefendant under a “worstcase” scenario i believe nrz may have to wait to receive the company’s proceeds in relation to the exercised call rights andor may account for a minor “onetime” offsetting chargeimpairment in relation to the funds withheld by wfc to cover the trustee’s litigation costs personally i believe the recent speculationfears surrounding this event is an overreaction by market participants simply put nrz has the legal right to exercise its call options  other portfolio investments note  and  i believe nrz has two other types of investments that should be briefly analyzed the company’s residential whole nonsecuritized mortgage loans and consumer loans portfolio nrz’s residential whole mortgage loans portfolio has the following three classifications  loans heldforinvestment which include purchased credit deteriorated pcd loans  loans heldforsale and  real estate owned “reo” as of  nrz’s residential whole loans heldforinvestment consisted of  loans with a weighted average yield of  a ltv ratio of  a weighted average life of  years and a fmv of  million nrz’s residential whole loans heldforsale consisted of  loans with a weighted average yield of  a ltv ratio of  a weighted average life of  years and a fmv of  billion nrz’s reo investments typically consist of assets received after the completion of the foreclosure process under most scenarios nrz quickly sells these received assets at the best possible valuation as of  nrz’s reo investments had a fmv of  million many of the characteristics and strategies applicable to nrz’s nonagency mbs portfolio hold true when it comes to the company’s residential whole mortgage loans portfolio as well as such further discussionanalysis of this portfolio is deemed redundantunwarranted finally let us now discuss nrz’s consumer loans portfolio during april  nrz initially invested  million for a  interest in springcastle finance llc’s joint venture “jv” springcastle jv which consisted of  billion of upb consumer loans after a  billion refinancing in october  nrz invested an additional  million to increase the company’s ownership stake in springcastle jv to approximately  after a second refinancing occurred in october  nrz has contributed an additional  million during november march  to increase springcastle jv’s available capital since nrz’s initial investment through  the company has increased its ownership stake in springcastle jv from  to  provided equity contributions totaling  million received distributions totaling  million and has generated a current inceptiontodate internal rate of return “irr” of  simply put this is an attractive return on investment “roi” which has continued to provide strong riskadjusted returns as of  springcastle jv had a upb of  billion an average chargeoff rate of  and a day delinquency rate of  while these percentages may seem a bit “alarming” to some readers i would point out the wac for springcastle jv is currently in the midteens as such i would point out springcastle jv’s chargeoff and delinquency rate is good considering the wac and weighted average yield generated on this portfolio of consumer loans in addition nrz is currently part of a fourmember consortium to purchase up to  billion of unsecured consumer loans on a forward basis from prosper marketplace prosper this company is an online marketplace lender who mainly provides unsecured consumer loans to individuals for purposing of but not limited to debt consolidation and home improvements this type of lendinginvesting is similar to another sector i cover here at seeking alpha business development companies “bdc” for instance prospect capital corp psec currently has an ongoing agreementrelationship with ondeck capital ondk whereas the online lender originates and bundles consumer loans into poolssecuritizations which are ultimately purchased by psec and other interested parties when analyzing all of nrz’s different types of investment portfolios i actually believe this current arrangement with prosper is the riskiest recently the entire onlinepeertopeer lending space has had rising chargeoff rates and delinquencies due to poor underwriting standards and a poor documentationreview process in addition it should be noted this consortium is purchasing these unsecured consumer loans at par not at a discount while this is certainly a risk i would hopeexpect nrz and the company’s consortium would do their own due diligence when ultimately purchasing unsecured consumer loans from prosper so far i don’t believe this has been an issue regarding this specific portfolio with that being said to remain nonbias i believe investors should continue to monitor this specific portfolio with a higher degree of scrutiny in the future as a benchmark nrz has disclosed the company’s targeted annualized levered yield for this specific portfolio is  with that being said in a rising interest rate environment most market participants would agree the us economy should be in “better shape” when it comes to various metrics gross domestic product gdp growth rising inflation lower unemployment rate rising wages etc… versus an economy during a falling interest rate environment in some instances this notes a recession as such it would make sense the average consumer should fare better in a rising interest rate environment in my opinion as long as ratesyields rise gradually under this general scenario there would likely be a decrease in consumer loan chargeoffsdelinquencies including an eventual rise in the wac and weighted average yields of these types of investments as such i believe this should be seen as yet another positive catalysttrend simply put nrz’s consumer loans portfolio should benefit in a rising interest rate environment conclusions drawn the focus of this article was to provide a detailed analysis on why nrz is currently an attractive equity investment to own this article first provided an analysis on nrz’s past and current economic return over multiple timeframes when compared to eighteen mreit peers simply put nrz’s economic return over the past several years has outperformed all the mreit peers that i currently cover this article then provided a detailed analysis of nrz’s investment portfolio to determine whether the company can continue its outperformance during a rising interest rate environment over the next several years the following nrz portfolios were analyzed  msrsexcess msrs  servicer advances  agencynonagency mbs a residential whole loans and b consumer loans due to the complexity and number of different types of investments held by nrz i believe most investors do not fully understand these portfolios as such i believe a detailed analysis was warranted to help explain why nrz unlike most of the company’s mreit peers will actually benefit from a rising interest rate environment when it comes to both income generation and net valuation fluctuations an important distinction to understand first nrz’s msr and excess msr portfolio will benefit from a rising interest rate environment within this interest rate scenario generally a decrease in prepayments will occur because a growing number of homeowners have mortgages that have lower interest rates when compared to current market interest rates as such the attractiveness of a mortgage refinance decreases as a result prepayment risk generally decreases therefore the average life of the underlying mortgagembs lengthens which results in a direct decrease in cpr percentages this ultimately leads to an increase in cash flows hence positively impacting nrz’s income generation and investment valuations this should be seen as a positive catalysttrend regarding nrz’s servicer advances portfolio as the article highlighted above management has recently extended the weighted average maturity of the notesbonds payable securing the company’s servicer advances while also converting most borrowings to fixedrate debt as such as interest rates rise in the future nrz should only see a minor increase in interest expense while continuing to record a net increase in interest income widening of interest margins this should be seen as another positive catalysttrend when it comes to nrz’s agency mbs portfolio the company similar to most mreit peers would see a reduction in value regarding this specific portfolio agency mbs prices have an inverse relationship to interest ratesyields however two points countering this trend should be mentioned first nrz could reinvest proceeds in higher coupon agency mbs andor recognize additional interest income on existing agency mbs from a decrease in cpr percentages furthermore nrz currently utilizes net short “tobeannounced” “tba” mbs interest rate payer swaps and interest rate caps to mitigate the rise in mortgage interest ratesus treasury yields regarding the company’s agency mbs portfolio which has a higher sensitivity to changes in interest rates higher duration regarding nrz’s nonagency mbs portfolio  of this portfolio consists of floatingrate investments as such as mortgage interest ratesus treasury yields increase nrz will begin to recognize additional interest income furthermore during a rising interest rate environment nonagency mbs typically experience a decrease in mortgage delinquencies stronger economy which will generally accelerate nrz’s call rights if this were to occur this would ultimately lead to an acceleration of nrz’s realizedcapital gains this strategy is also applicable when it comes to a majority of nrz’s residential whole loans portfolio simply put i believe this should be seen as another positive catalysttrend finally when it comes to nrz’s consumer loans portfolio typically in a rising interest rate environment most market participants would agree the us economy should improve when it comes to various metrics gdp growth rising inflation lower unemployment rate rising wages etc… versus an economy during a falling interest rate environment in some instances this notes a recession as such it would make sense the average consumer should fare better in a rising interest rate environment in my opinion as long as ratesyields rise gradually under this general scenario there would likely be a decrease in consumer loan chargeoffsdelinquencies including an eventual rise in the wac and weighted average yields of these types of investments when seasoned loans are paidoff and replaced with new loans this should be seen as yet another positive catalysttrend as such i believe nrz’s consumer loans portfolio should also benefit in a rising interest rate environment my buy sell or hold recommendation from the analysis provided above i currently rate nrz as a sell when the company’s stock price is trading at or greater than a  premium to my projected bv as of   per share a hold when trading at greater than a  but less than a  premium to my projected bv as of  and a buy when trading at or less than a  premium to my projected bv as of  as such i currently rate nrz as a buy my current price target for nrz is  per share this is currently the price where my recommendation would change to a sell when calculated this would be a net price appreciation of approximately  from nrz’s current valuation as of  along with the data presented within this article this recommendation considers the following mreit catalystsfactors  projected future discounted cash flows of nrz’s msr and excess msr portfolio  projected future agency and nonagency mbs price movements  projected future derivative valuations and  projected nearterm dividend per share rates this recommendation also considers the high probability of multiple federal “fed” funds rate increases by the federal open market committee fomc during  this is a more hawkish view when compared to most of the last year due to recent macroeconomic trendsevents this also considers the eventual “winddown” of the fed’s balance sheet final note each investors buy sell or hold decision is based on ones risk tolerance time horizon and dividend income

reverse mortgages as a key solution for seniors’ retirement planning problems in a keynote address to the members of leadingage florida a group that represents nonprofit care providers aag finds success with selleck’s ‘softer’ approach — american advisors group explained the continued appeal of tom selleck as a reverse mortgage pitchman citing internal research that found the actor elicits a

explores the good and bad reasons for using a reverse mortgage — with some advice that’s open for interpretation and debate reverse mortgages in the news our international look at reverse mortgages continues this time with yet another piece from australia and a detailed exploration of the reverse mortgages available in india business today a publication that covers business news in india walked potential borrowers through that country’s reverse mortgage options in a guest piece written in somewhat colorful english the story explains that banks generally allow borrowers to take out  to  of the home’s value and as in the united states the loan only comes due when the borrower dies or leaves the property in addition there’s no prepayment penalty the piece states “consider the benefits and drawbacks simultaneously and if the former outweighs the latter then surely a decision of getting the reverse mortgage loan will not ever make you repent” the story concludes meanwhile back in

purpose of paying off debt and all upfront costs if any were financed then the total hecm balance due would be equal to the debts paid off plus the upfront costs of the hecm we have to learn how to
