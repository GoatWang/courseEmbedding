swivel all recline lazy boy the royal diamond stretch slipcover fits great and looks awesomefit pretty wellwent on a lazy boy recliner worked well didnt like the way the elastic loops fit to bottom of chair but overall looked like original lazy boysue gthis cover is perfect for our large  year old lazy boy saved me from buying a new chairfit perfect for large chairlooks nicebutthis set is four pieces which are all marked for the area they cover however they should also be marked front  backit would keep someone me from putting them on backwards first and then having to turn them around my recliner is a velour lazy boy and its pretty fluffy so the cover fit snugly over it and every piece fit except the piece that covers the top of the chair back rest where it meets the seat area it seems a little too short and on the back side the edges show the elastic if you are not careful the chair hasnt been sat in much to see if the cover is going to roll up on the back rest yet all that being said it looks very nice on the chair the fabric has a suede feel and the color is nice but the fabric is very thin so if the chair back cover stays put i will be happy with the coversure fit royal diamond stretch wing chair slipcovei was very impressed with the two slipcovers that we purchased good quality stretch material that fit over the wing back chairs  they made our old chairs come back to life amazing slipcovercover was easy to put on i bought a  piece before this one is much better only reason didnt rate it a  i have small lazy boy recliners its a little bigworki used this slipcover on a smaller sized wing chair it fit fine love the feel i love the way this slipcover feels but i have to tuck it every time i get up i have a regular sized lazy boy recliner and the slipcover pretty much swallows it but the fabric is very plush and thick and the excess can be tucked in so i decided to keep it for that reason i would recommend it to anyone who doesnt mind tucking several times a day wing chair slipcoverthe slipcover was a bit large for my wing chair however it was a nice slipcover of good quality sponsored linkswhats

effective july   in this position stretch will oversee facebook’s legal and security departments “colin has been an instrumental leader on the facebook legal team and has earned the trust and confidence of management the board of directors and our entire company we are very excited to have him as our new general counsel” said sheryl sandberg chief operating officer of facebook stretch has been a senior leader on facebook’s legal team since joining the company in  as deputy general counsel stretch has led many of facebook’s most significant legal initiatives stretch served as lead negotiator for the company’s settlement with the federal trade commission in  he led the appellate victory in the highprofile winklevoss case and has led the team that advises facebook on legal issues relating to new products “helping advance facebook’s mission of connecting the world is at the center of our team’s work and i look forward to the opportunity this new role represents” said stretch “this is an extremely talented group of lawyers and an awesome responsibility i can’t wait to get started” stretch will replace ted ullyot who has been facebook’s vice president and general counsel since october  ullyot previously announced his intention to leave the company on may th “colin’s appointment is a testament both to his abilities and to ted’s leadership ted built a strong team at facebook that we have grown to depend on for worldclass counsel which made promoting from within our company the clear and best choice” sandberg said prior to joining the company in  stretch was a

isaac colin stretch named facebook’s new general counsel as top lawyer departs june   at  pm pt tweet share print facebook announced on thursday that colin stretch a threeandahalfyear veteran of the company will soon take over the position of vice president and general counsel for the social giant assuming responsibility for leading facebook’s legal team stretch will take over the position after the departure of ted ullyot facebook’s acting vp and general counsel of the past five years who announced his intention to leave the company one month ago “colin has been an instrumental leader on the facebook legal team and has earned the trust and confidence of management the board of directors and our entire company” sheryl sandberg facebook’s coo said in a statement “we are very excited to have him as our new general counsel” stretch had previously worked as vp and deputy general counsel under ullyot was a partner at kellogg huber hansen todd evans  figel and is a graduate of dartmouth college and harvard law school during his time at facebook stretch has worked on a wide array of litigation including leading the team working on the  million acquisition of photosharing startup instagram fighting the ongoing intellectual property battles against opponents like the winklevoss twins and paul ceglia and dealing with official inquiries from the federal trade commission over privacy concerns he also dealt with litigation leading up to facebook’s initial public offering on the nasdaq exchange one year ago departing vp and general counsel ted ullyotperhaps most importantly stretch — alongside ullyot — has been deeply involved in facebook’s current and ongoing discussions with the us national security agency on the subject of governmental requests for facebook data — more specifically on exactly how much and in what detail facebook is allowed to disclose said requests to the general public the company reached a breakthrough last week when for the first time ever companies were allowed to disclose all us national securityrelated requests made of the company though displayed only in aggregate with other nonnsa requests this issue in particular has become topofmind over the past two weeks after whistleblower edward snowden and the guardian alleged that facebook — as well as a number of other large tech companies — gave the federal government direct access to company servers and user data a claim which has since been strongly denied by all of the alleged tech company participants so at this especially delicate point in time stretch’s appointment is in part likely a move to ease any possible turbulence for an incredibly busy legal team in need of a smooth leadership transition “helping advance facebook’s mission of connecting the world is at the center of our team’s work and i look forward to the opportunity this new role represents” stretch said in a statement “this is an extremely talented group of lawyers and an awesome responsibility i can’t wait to get started” ullyot’s last date at facebook is july  after which stretch will move into his new position and in timely fashion here’s one of those new instagram videos depicting the

bought to update old green and burgundy chairs in our pastors office they are a good size for the chairs we had a lot cheaper to cover than to buy new chairs they do need to be tucked in every few days they also collect hair and fuzz but nothing a lint roller doesnt fix during cleaning read more good product verified purchase it fits perfectly my chair good product read more maytex collin wing chair slipcover verified purchase look nice but always have to straighten and tuck when used read more most helpful good slip cover verified purchase i purchased this slip cover in the mocha color for a smallpetite wing back chair overall i am pleased with the reasonable cost the color and the fit of the slip cover the color of the fabric is not too dark or too light the fabric weight is light not too thin which makes it easier to tuck excess fabric into the chair without it looking bulky simple easy to follow instructions of how to properly cover and tuck the chair were included in the packaging be careful when removing the paper tags attached to the cover as they could rip the seams if removed with too much force one down point that i have noticed is the fabric is a lent catcher i am sure this is something a good lint roller could fix but i suppose this could also be an issue if shedding pets are present i think this slip cover is a good alternative to having the entire chair reupholstered read more not good for me this slip cover is very well constructed and it was very easy to put on within one day it was full of lint hair and etc i tried everything i could to remove the lint and was unsuccessful i washed it hoping this would remove the lint but it didnt it did however wash very nicely read more better fit for smaller wing chair verified purchase i am thankful for another shoppers review that led me to try this wing chair cover for my smaller than average wing chair the stretch covers do not fit the smaller chairs well this one was a much better fit however be aware that no cover i tried will look like an upholstered piece on the smaller wing chairs this one works because it is not meant to look like an upholstered piece so the fit seems appropriate these are the dimensions of my chairt floor to top seat cushion is  wide at widest point and the arm is  deep from front edge of wing to front of armthere will be creases between the wing and arm where they meet overall cover looks very good and the fabric has a good weight and texture just be careful when removing tags which are on the outsidehold the seam tightly as you remove the tags and there should not be any tears in fabric read more chair cover verified purchase im not a big fan of slip covers but after destroying my fabric and not having time to do it myself this was the next best thing great quality and holds up great with my three kids and new puppy i would buy another one  read more slipcover verified purchase good quality fit well and washed really nicely easy to put on and take off as
