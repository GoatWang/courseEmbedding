rely on government funding for their programs saw a sharp decline in the amount of money they received from both state and federal government this put many organizations in an unbelievable predicament having to make choices about what programs and services to scale back or eliminate this was especially difficult for nonprofits like amikids a national organization that operates some of the most effective juvenile justice programs across the country during the  florida legislative session the challenge for amikids was to increase the money it received through state funding in order to effectively do this they needed to position themselves among key stakeholders including legislators as an organization that is dedicated to the success of our children in the juvenile justice system and that its programs provides a high return on investment the first step in the process was to identify the specific needs of the organization and explore funding opportunities that would help accomplish those needs in addition they need to position themselves as a leader in supporting kids in the juvenile justice system through our understanding of the regulatory process and the specific needs of amikids as well as our commitment to such an important cause we were able to secure additional funding for the organization in the state budget in addition our government advocacy work for amikids also contributed to an overall successful session for the juvenile justice system in florida several bills were passed and the overall budget increased most importantly there was a 5 percent increase in supplemental funding for the department of juvenile justice this increase in funding will not only contribute to the success of youth participating in programs through amikids but through other organizations that offer similar programs projects like this provide our team a sense of what is really important in our state having a lasting positive impact on the lives of children is what matters most diverting crisis through communication in spring  cargill corporation a global provider of food agriculture financial and industrial products and services was challenged with a highstakes crisislike situation the finely textured beef ftb business was dominated by a onemonth highprofile media and online attack led by an abc world news reporter a school food blogger food activists and others in less than one month  of cargills ftb business was gone as the frenzy over pink slime caused retail customers to banish this beef product from their stores this was another example where the weight of science and fact was trumped by emotion requiring a deft wellresearched approach to build confidence among its most critical stakeholders—its customers—while taking into account the concerns of shoppers we were engaged by cargill to help them persuade their customers to reintroduce ftb in their stores our research revealed a grocery stores reintroduction of ground beef containing ftb is highly unlikely to impact consumers shopping habits or opinions about the grocery store in addition the research revealed consumers overwhelmingly believe ground beef that contains ftb should be labeled and that customers should be able to choose ground beef with or without ftb armed with this research cargill was able to confidently take a leadership role on ftb education demonstrating its commitment to owning the issue through the launch of an ftbspecific digital program housed at wwwgroundbeefanswerscom and a recent announcement that it would label every shipment of ground beef including ftb—an industry leading move in keeping with our research findings responses to the labeling announcement received no backlash and only  of the media mentions the original pink slime activistdriven controversy generated in fact the response to the announcement was overwhelmingly positive even drawing accolades from bloggers and activists who were previously ftbs biggest critics raising visibility and third party endorsement through social media standardized testing among elementary grades and high school students has become a normal part of the primary education curriculum across the united states in  the state of florida was looking for a new standardsbased assessment provider to offer the standardized testing to florida students as key lawmakers and gov rick scott called for a fazing out of the fcat examination as one of five companies bidding on the new contract act aspire was hoping to differentiate itself from its competitors as the first linear digital assessment system to connect student performance from kindergarten through th grade the provider thought it had a good shot however there was one challenge to overcome act aspire is a recently new startup without a track record backed by the wellknown national brand that facilitates national college admissions examinations across the county act we were engaged by act aspire to help them maximize impact among key legislators and statewide constituents who care about education and the states standardized testing procedures we developed a twopart solution government advocacy coupled with a solid communications strategy with our deep experience in education reform and our understanding of the states bidding process we were able to position act aspire favorably with key legislators across the state a public awareness campaign was created to capitalize on the success of the national brand but distinguish act aspire as a separate organization focusing on primary education we built a statespecific microsite called right for florida using social media tools including facebook and twitter the purpose of the site was to identify stakeholders and reinforce messages that would help constituents understand the difference between act and act aspire how act aspire stood out among its competitors and provide general information about state assessments we also worked with traditional media outlets like the tampa bay times to obtain earned media coverage about act aspire as part of the social media engagement profile we performed regular ongoing research and analysis the analytics on the website showed a steady increase in page views and unique visitors over the course of the project in fact the right for florida site had the highest percentage of unique visitors among other statespecific act aspire sites across the country we were also able track that website traffic was coming from public school districts across the state and the florida department of education – the stakeholders we were hoping to engage many visitors were staying on the site for more than  minutes and viewing eight or more pages per visit this project helped raise the profile of act aspire among key constituents it was evident that through these efforts we were able to establish third party attention that helped influence key decision makers securing procurement opportunities republic services is a publicaly traded waste services company that provides collection recycling and disposal services to residential commercial and industrial customers throughout the united states they have contracts with various governments throughout florida after several years of providing collection services to hillsborough county republic services was faced with a challenge in order to lower prices ensure quality services and have more control over the solid waste stream in hillsborough county county commissioners put out to bid garbage collections in september  the goal was to award three to five vendors contracts to cover five collection zones across the county each with about 5 households each company would be eligible to provide services to no more than two zones the incumbents including republic services were required to bid along with several others on the new contracts companies were asked to bid on a range of garbage collection options including manual pickup and automated collection for garbage and recycling success for republic services was to win a contract for one zone in order to do that they needed to differentiate themselves among their competitors – specifically by offering a competitive bid that provided hillsborough county residents the best value in collection services we were engaged by republic services to guide them through the procurement process and facilitate communication with key stakeholders republic services received a new year contract with the county including an extension option of threeyears and both zones the new contact
