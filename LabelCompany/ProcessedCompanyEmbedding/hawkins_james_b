developer and manufacturer of vital sign monitoring equipment and its predecessor from august  to january  he also served as secretary of invivo from july  to january  he earned his undergraduate degree in business commerce from santa clara university and holds an mba from san francisco state universitytwst mr hawkins lets begin with a brief overview of natus medical how did it start how has it evolved where is it todaymr hawkins sure natus started back in the lets say early s as a hearing screening company for newborns they had a technology that could test babies for hearing before they left the hospital they got the patents on that technology brought it to market but maybe more importantly over  during the s made it where states and even the federal government made it become a standard of care because it was so compelling to do a hearing test on newborn babies to have not only cost savings but just really for the lifestyle of the family and the babies to be able to live normal lives they were able to get that to be a standard of care it really then blossomed starting in  where now we think in the united states probably   of the babies have hearing testing before they leave the hospital and then around the developed world now were probably up to   and natus as they were doing this was never really a profitable company trying to introduce a new technology into a new market in about  we were able to then change the model and focus on profitability and growth not just trying to establish the market and we were successful in doing that and then from there branched into other newborn areas where now we think we probably have the number one diverse product line going into the newborn nursery and the neonatal intensive care unit and then since have branched out into neurology were one of the leading neurology companies now doing eeg emg and psg which is sleep diagnostics for sleep apneatwst lets talk about the descriptive statistics for neurodiagnostic and newborn care how big is this market how fast is it growingmr hawkins for newborn care its a real interesting question in the united states its sort of a flat market right now because of the headwinds being the birth rate in the difficult economic times birth rates are down we think about  from the peaks in  and so thats created a little bit of a headwind but its also happened in the past and as the economy picks up we think it will certainly snap back its a little harder to know the numbers around the rest of the world but we hear europe birth rates are down too asia were not sure about but asia really isnt the big user overall outside of japan australia singapore and hong kong theyre not big users of hearing screening so in the china market the indian market thailand those kinds of places were just scratching that surface right now big opportunity down the road but to date maybe  or  of our salestwst would you talk about the diversity of your product linemr hawkins yes certainly weve been innovators our business model overall has been to buy technologies or products once theyre introduced or will be introduced very soon its very difficult to develop products from scratch when you look at the history of the venture capitalists and the money theyve put into medical devices and product development overall it hasnt been a good bet i would say overall so our strategy is to have internal growth but then as companies come out and they introduce products they might not have the sales channels certainly both domestic and international and then were able to come in and buy those products from companies and then take them to the next levelthe wall street transcript is a unique service for investors and industry researchers  providing fresh commentary and insight through
