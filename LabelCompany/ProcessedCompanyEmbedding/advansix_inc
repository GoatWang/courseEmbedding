corporate eventssummaryadvansix is off to a great start in cash flow conversion continues to be problematic but the situation is improvingappealing multiples low leverage ratios and improving cash flow conversion continue to make shares worthwhile to add on dipsadvansix asix started  on a very strong note i have already looked at the prospects for the spinoff from honeywell hon on multiple occasions in the recent past in general i like advansix as an operator as valuation multiples are modest especially given the relative soft point in the cycle at which the business operated in recent quarters these low multiples make shares look very appealing offset by the fact that cash flow conversion was very poor with capital spending outpacing depreciation charges by a substantial amount despite a lack of growth instead advansix had to invest heavily to meet environmental requirements among others shares have quickly risen from levels around  at the time of the spinoff in the fall of  to trade in a  range in recent months i had hoped that poor q results driven by large maintenance charges would have provided a buying opportunity but fortunately this has not materialized a commoditylike business advansix produces products like ammonium sulfates nylon and chemical intermediates which are in essence commoditylike businesses although input and selling prices are very closely correlated nylon is the key product responsible for half of sales as the remainder of sales is split up across the other two product groups notably the nonnylon markets are quite cyclical with regards to pricing with cumene which derives its price from crude being a key input given the plunge in crude prices which has hurt both input and selling prices sales have come under a great deal of pressure over the past two years as this has hurt margins as well of course the situation has stabilized at this point in time as crude is now hovering around the  mark if you are operating in a commoditylike business a key proponent of the performance is not in your control therefore management focuses on what it can control which is operating a tightly integrated business and delivering on operational excellence as the company benefits from access to relative cheap us natural gas as well off to a strong start after declining crude prices resulted in sales falling from  billion in  to  billion in  advansix is off to a strong start this year firstquarter revenues rose by more than  to  million mostly driven by higher prices passthrough pricing rose by  marketbased pricing was up  and volumes rose by  the company was pleased with the generally tighter market conditions supporting this growth notably nylon was very strong as the company benefits from a recovery in north american construction nylon is most commonly used to fabricate carpets the company posted an ebitda number of  million being equal to  of sales this was up just modestly compared to the previous year as last years number was inflated by a onetime benefit adjusted for that benefit ebitda rose by  as margins improved by  basis points the company posted a net profit number of  million equivalent to  per share the company continues to project relatively reasonable conditions for the rest of the year although nylon pricing might become more challenged in h if we assume that this quarter might be representative for the rest of the year the full year ebitda number might come in around  million holding  million in cash operating with  million in debt leverage ratios stand at  times ebitda this number increases to  times if pensionrelated liabilities are included in the leverage calculation as well note that ebitda of  million is approaching the  levels as ebitda numbers have fluctuated in a  million range in the period  if the  million earnings number can be annualized as well earnings of  million might be within reach this translates into a healthy earnings number of  per share for a mere  times earnings multiple the reason why current earnings multiples are so low is the fact that cash flow conversion is very poor depreciation charges now run at roughly  million a year as the company guides that capital spending is seen around  million this year that suggests that the company generates free cash flow of  million this year which means that fee cash flow comes in at little over  per share for a  times multiple the good news is that capital spending already came in at  million in q as capital spending is seen at  million in the remaining three quarters of the year although it remains a headache for investors another nearterm headwind are pension contributions which are seen at  million this year versus a normalized expense of  million a quick note on capex and replacement values on the conference call management made an interesting observation ppe is valued at little less than  million on the balance sheet while the current replacement value comes in at  billion the company guides for  capital spending in relation to this replacement value in a normalized environment translating into annual capital spending of  million which means that cash flow conversion will continue to improve going forwards if that replacement valuation is realistic shareholder equity per share comes closer to  per share while these legacy assets might be very much undervalued on the companys books it comes at a cost as well the company does face outages which require frequent maintenance and upgrades notably unexpected outages can be costly in terms of reliability service to customers and the costs of emergency fixes with depreciation charges gradually rising to  million in  free cash flow generation on the back of the current environment really comes in close to  as a very modest leverage ratio and  cash flow yield make shares look very appealing even if conditions are not even redhot yet at this point in time adding on dips advansix started the year on a stronger foot than i had been expecting as i anticipated earnings of close to  per share for  when the company released its results for  after a  per share number in q it seems relatively safe to say that this target will be achieved unless major unplanned outages take place in the rest of the year or pricing will be very soft i note that capital spending still runs at  of depreciation charges this year as free cash flow of  million equals just  of projected earnings of  million the good news is that much of the capital spending has already taken place in q as the conversion will improve towards  in the rest of the year with leverage coming down rapidly the gap between depreciation  capital spending is narrowing in a rather rapid fashion while volumes are solid and multiples continue to be quite compelling i continue to be attracted to the stock having not hit the buy button when shares hit a low of  in april i am now again left out at  amidst the continued improving operations i remain a buyer if shares retreat to  per share disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote

cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll

to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website expand

ad for your business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer customers visit your site but if
