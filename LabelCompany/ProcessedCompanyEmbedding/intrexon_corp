synthetic biology synthetic biology is the engineering of biological systems to enable rational designbased control of cellular function for a specific purpose  the programming of dna and reformatting of genetic circuitry within cell platforms has created a paradigm shift whereby the analysis of biology is being supplanted by its synthesis  this advancement has the potential to significantly impact approaches relied upon for some time across a variety of industries the ability to create and modify organic materials on increasingly larger scales has occurred with a number of breakthroughs in genetic engineering including automated dna sequencing dna synthesis the advent of computational bioinformatics and the creation of genetically modified organisms  today intrexons expertise in

jawdropping growth continue after tuesdays  jump nextgeneration biotech intrexon kept the growth going in  what powered the company ahead where is the company headed maxx chatsko tmfblackngold mar   at am image source john goodeflickr who said fame only lasts for  minutes already on a tear entering  synthetic biology leader intrexon nysexon roared higher after reporting fullyear  earnings earlier this week a little over two months into the year intrexon stock is up over  the company is having no problem finding success by leveraging its technological knowhow and making strategic acquisitions and partnerships to further exploit its biologic technologies the result amazing growth while revenue and collaboration count will continue to soar higher in  many investors may still be wondering what the heck is going on what exactly does intrexon do to deserve an  pop to start the year was  really that good of a year what does intrexon dointrexon leverages its technological knowhow in engineering biology to create biotech products with healthcare energy food consumer and environmental applications for partners it collects fees to conduct rd and if a product is successfully commercialized collects royalty payments on sales of the product the company also generates revenue from licensing its biotech tools such as genetic parts and services such as dna construction software and although the product lineup isnt very deep today intrexon generates product revenue from selling biotech products that it owns outright just the numbersthe yearoveryear growth for intrexon was impressive by all accounts  even expenses and net loss here are the important numbers      change collaboration revenue  million  million  service revenue  million   product revenue  million  million  total revenue  million  million  operating expenses  million  million  net income  million  million  source sec filings eight collaborators accounted for  of the companys collaboration revenue which included seven healthcare partnerships but while intrexon is often revered for its growing pipeline of healthcare assets  of its product revenue was derived from the sale of pregnant cows live calves and livestock used in production a further  of its service revenue was derived from cattle breeding programs uh what dont forget in july  the company acquired trans ova genetics which is the largest supplier of bovine embryos used to breed livestock in the united states the resulting cattle provide enhanced dairy and beef production and give farmers more bang for their buck to be clear synthetic biology isnt used for the livestock platform just yet but its a stark reminder that intrexons nearterm financial performance will be determined outside of health applications which typically have long product development cycles after zooming out from the yearoveryear growth comparison to include longer time scales the companys growth  the primary reason for investor optimism  is similarly impressive       collaboration revenue  million  million  million  million service revenue  million    product revenue  million  million   total revenue  million  million  million  million operating expenses  million  million  million  million net income  million  million  million  million source sec filings the company appears to have a handle on successfully growing its business although the large losses incurred year after year serve as a reminder that intrexon has a long way to go before breaking even  let alone turning a profit for shareholders its a longterm investment that requires quite a bit of faith that big revenue streams will develop management guidance for intrexon expects that existing collaborators will have up to  novel therapeutic candidates in clinical trials by the end of  while a recent healthcare collaboration with ziopharm and university of texas md anderson aimed at developing a cart oncology portfolio gets most of the media coverage there are several other businessbuilding events that will have a more immediate effect on the shareholders as mentioned above intrexons acquisition of the nations leading bovine embryo platform will provide a bulk of product revenue management expects food applications to deliver product and sales revenue of at least  million its important to note that doesnt include major contributions from aquabounty salmon yet to be approved or the recent acquisition of okanagan specialty fruits the owners of the now infamous arctic apple which doesnt brown when sliced either way the guidance calls for a giant leap from roughly  million generated from food applications in  what does it mean for investorsi must admit my attitude about intrexon is beginning to change for the bullish given the tangible nearterm growth opportunities however most of intrexon stocks gains in  are the result of optimism about the companys healthcare partnerships which mostly amount to future potential right now lets face it no headline about cattle breeding product and services revenue sent shares higher  nor will it despite the growth opportunities in food applications for  and the continuing string of new acquisitions the market is out of sync with reality at the moment for that reason i would tread carefully around the companys  billion market cap  maxx chatsko has no position in any

collaboration focused on the development of microbial strains for fermentative production of peptidebased active pharmaceutical ingredients apis peptidebased apis are used as highly effective treatments in numerous therapeutic classes however due to their structural complexity peptides often are costly and difficult to produce requiring specialized equipment and reagents and lengthy synthetic sequences with low chemical yields through the collaboration intrexon will utilize its proprietary microbial hosts and fermentation processes for expression of peptides with high fidelity and titer intrexon will concentrate on the strain generation initial fermentation and downstream isolation as well as purification of the target apis following this foundational work johnson matthey jm will be responsible for product scaleup formulation and commercialization under the terms of the agreement jm will have access to intrexons technologies and expertise for microbebased fermentative production of specific target apis and intrexon will receive a technology access fee and reimbursement for all research and development costs the agreement also provides for milestone payments to
