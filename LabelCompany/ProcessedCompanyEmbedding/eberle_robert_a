second quarter fiscal  earnings call im here with rick booth our chief financial officer who will provide a detailed review of the quarters financials results and our guidance going forward both rick and i will be available for questions following his remarks we are delighted with the results for the second quarter and our progress against our strategic plan with a strong sales quarter with record arr bookings we entered into a strategic relationship with visa and we executed to deliver strong financial results in the quarter during my remarks i will cover our financial results our record arr sales a significant win for our newly launched digital banking platform and the visa partnership which we signed in and of this past quarter ill start with the financial highlights for the second quarter subscription and transaction revenues grew  on a constant currently basis to  million revenues overall were  million up  on a consistent currently basis or  excluding banking services ebitda increased to  million operating income was  million or  of revenue and finally we recorded eps of  for the quarter ahead of our target and expectations so strong financial results across the board we have a strategic plan and we are executing against that plan we made strategic well thoughtout investments in large markets where we have a lot of knowledge experience and customers key focus of fy  is driving sales results to produce a return on those investments weve been successful in doing so in the first half and our pipeline gives us confidence our success will continue we are growing the company while transitioning the revenue model this year fy  is the last year of model transition and financial headwind as we focus on signing new arr to drive revenue growth and margin expansion in fy  and beyond accordingly weve given guidance for  that begins to show the financial benefit of our strategy second quarters results confirm our confidence in that guidance and our strategic plan with that in mind the clear highlight of the second quarter was our strong sales results during the quarter we booked a record  million of new arr the markets positive reaction to our offerings is clear with over half the record arr coming from paymodex and other new products we can confidently see the return on the investments weve been making to put the  million sales results in context qs arr represents  increase from the same quarter a year ago through the first half of the year we are double the prior years arr sales result so what does this mean for bottomline well we clearly have exhilarating momentum in our markets our product innovations are well received and the investments weve made wellplaced and we are building a highgrowth subscription and transaction business with significant leverage in the business model i couldnt be more pleased with our position or more excited about our future our strategic plan is designed to extend our leadership position win new business and drive accelerating subscription revenue growth and expanding our operating margins our sales efforts are aligned with that strategy with all our key growth drivers and major products thats now sold on subscription and transaction revenue model in fact each of our key growth drivers contributed to our strong sales results in the second quarter with  new paymodex customer wins nine new digital banking customer wins and five new legal fund management wins perhaps the most meaningful and most gratifying new q customer engagement from a strategic perspective was for our newly launched digital banking platform while the sevenfigure arr is financially significant the most important thing is the validation of our new digital banking growth and investment strategy we are directly addressing a compelling market need with a platform that is differentiated from anything else in the markets the bank who has selected us as is a leading west coast regional bank with a strong business in commercial banking franchise a strong desire to grow that market and a commitment to bestinclass digital technologies it shows our digital banking platform to enable them to deliver a worldclass user experience to acquire growing deep and highly profitable relationships with businesses of all sizes from smbs to major multinational corporates and to strengthen their competitive position through innovation and bestinclass payments and cash management services we just launched this platform to the market in the second quarter the market reaction we received the pipeline we are building and our selection by this leading technology bank all point to the positive return on the investment we are making finally a key event in the quarter was our signing of a strategic alliance with visa this is an important market validation and a strategic step forward in bottomline becoming the way for businesses to pay and get paid the combination of paymodex with visa payables advances the two companys shared vision business payments it provides a seamless experience that simplifies payment automation and maximizes cost savings efficiency and security there are a number of reasons visa chose to partner with bottomline at the top of the list i put our success scale and experience in business payments we processed over  billion through paymodex in  a  billion we now have over  members on the network we are automating business payments of scale efficiently effectively and securely second id cite our vendor pay model which we have proven works and is comparable to and aligns well with visas interchange business model and then finally id point to innovation and technology the proprietary ip weve developed around vendor segmentation enrollment and onboarding are unique and the advanced platform capabilities weve developed are specifically designed to facilitate and expedite business payments and they are well ahead of the market were delighted to partner with visa it provides a validation and endorsement for one of the largest payment companies in the world it gives us the opportunity to expand our existing bank relationships and it opens the door to new relationships and the combination will enhance our platform to include card payments driving adoption and network growth so in summary we entered fy  with a bold plan and we are executing against that plan we are building a highgrowth subscription and transaction business with significant operating leverage the strong sales in q validates our strategy and it positions us well to produce continued increases in shareholder value ill now turn it over to rick booth for a detailed review of the financials and then well open up the call for questions richard booth thank you rob from a financial perspective im pleased to say the quarter was shaped primarily by continued strong growth in subs and trans revenue and this performance helped drive core operating income and earnings per share both above guidance the financial highlights of the quarter included the subs ad trans revenue grew  on a constant current basis which brought our total revenue to  we booked  million of arr up  yearoveryear operating income was  million or  of revenue ebitda was  million or  of revenue and earnings per share of  with three times ahead of guidance in addition to these financial metrics were seeing sales success and a pipeline that positions us well for the remainder of  and  i will now provide a more detailed look into the second quarter financial results turning first to revenue our total revenue of  million represents  yearoveryear growth on a constant currency basis excluding the banking services which well be emphasizing total revenue was up  on a constant current basis yearoveryear the biggest driver of that growth is subs and trans revenue which was up  on a constant current basis yearoveryear to  million which is equivalent to  million on an annualized basis with that growth as a percentage of revenue subs and trans is now  of total revenue up five percentage points yearoveryear when you include maintenance as well as subs and trans total recurring revenue of  million is  of total revenue up four percentage points yearoveryear and equal to  million on an annualized basis software and maintenance were each up slightly yearoveryear and although these are secondary to our subscription and transaction growth we appreciate their profit contribution turning to professional services as weve discussed in the past we want to provide services only as necessary to implement our solutions and to ensure our customer success we believe this is the right strategy to grow revenue income and shareholder value and well continue to deemphasize services consistent with this approach we recorded  million less of banking professional services revenue than in the same period in the prior year and excluding the banking professional services which would be empathizing revenue growth with  on a constant currency basis turning to sales performance which is arguably even more important than current revenue production we added a significant number of new subs and trans based customers across our key growth drivers where our product vision is driving new deal signings at a very significant rate we signed  paymodex agreements under the vendor pay model we were selected by nine new customers for our digital banking platforms and we also added five new legal spend management customers we are particularly pleased that the deals we are signing are getting larger and more valuable when translated into annual recurring revenue bookings for the quarter were  million up  yearoveryear and this brought total first half arr bookings to  million this is up  versus the same period a year before it is this strength in level of arr bookings that give us confidence in the long term growth in our subs and trans businesses now as you know these arr figures are estimates of transactional volume and in our model these customers take time to implement to go live and then to ramp up in the full revenue production but once revenue is achieved they provide visibility and consistency to the model as well as the power to drive margin expansion as we turn to profit and margins we finished the quarter with operating income of  million or  of revenue as well as ebitda of  million or  of revenue this higher revenue drove the yearoveryear expansion in gross margins particularly in subs and trans our overall gross margin was  million or  of revenue and the subs and trans gross margin was  a gross margin expansion of two percentage points on a yearoveryear basis from an operating expense standpoint sales and marketing expense for the quarter was  million or  of revenue up  yearoveryear and development expense was  million or  of revenue consistent with the prior year in terms of cash flow or operating cash flow was  million for the quarter in addition to our customary capex significant uses of cash in the quarter included  million through secured and minority interest in a small software company and a source code license both in the banking space and  million spent completing our prior share buyback as a result we ended the quarter with  million of cash on hand in addition to the strong cash balance we also have a significant backlog backlog at the end of december was  million up  from last year when considering backlog it is important to remember that backlog included only contractually committed revenues and therefore excludes estimated amounts for our transaction based businesses including paymodex and legal spend management offerings looking ahead our visibility improves because a good portion of the strong arr bookings will become revenue in fiscal  and as a result were pleased to reconfirm with increased confidence the fiscal  guidance of  to  growth in subs and trans revenue and  to  operating income based on the yeartodate we are throwing ph up our fiscal  guidance for two items first the impact of foreign exchange and second our continued deemphasis of the professional services relative to foreign exchange the recent strength of the dollar means that foreign currency is expected to have an impact on revenue of approximately  million per quarter versus the previous guidance but this will have little or no impact on operating income margins relative to professional services we continue to deemphasize standalone services in favor of more strategic and profitable revenue streams we expect the impact of this to be approximately  million per quarter versus the previous guidance so in summary were pleased by the performance of our key growth drivers with constant currently growth of  in subs and trans as well as operating income performance of  and  earnings per share and were focused on continuing to execute on our strategy which is built on three things first investing in solutions targeted at large markets where we have competitive advantage second leveraging those offerings to drive new deal signings and recurring revenue and third using the power of the subs and trans revenue to expand growth and operating margins q was another solid step forward on this plan and with that wed be pleased to take your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is going to be from the line of brett huff with stephens please go ahead brett huff good afternoon guys robert eberle hi good evening brett brett huff just want to go through the guidance change again so the forex increased forex headwind is  million lower revenue guide for the quarter and the deemphasizing of the professional services in banking is lower  million per quarter on rev and there is no impact on eps per quarter are those all right assumptions robert eberle yes the  and the  are correct and we don’t see any significant impact on profitability brett huff okay and then the new exbanking statistic that you guys are giving is the i think you are talking about growth exbanking that excludes the just professional services associated with legacy perpetual license contracts related services is that right robert eberle yes it is kind of both periods that you are comparing brett huff okay can you talk a little bit also about the digital banking deal is the new one you just announced different than the one you announced last quarter robert eberle yes it was different this is actually a bigger deal for us and its a deal for our platform capabilities in a much in a larger market and i think it is a bank that is more of a technology leader so they took a look across a number of the players and their selection to buy bottomline is pretty meaningful in the market weve not disclosed the name at this point for a mix of reasons but id say thats a significant difference for us was just the level and certainly the economics i think its a clear endorsement of what weve brought to the platform a lot of strategy is in terms of the capabilities around monetizing and securing small business and large corporate relationships and being able to do so in an environment where banks are increasingly challenged by different outside technology providers trying to get into essentially the businesses that our banking customers have been in and are in today brett huff okay that’s helpful and one more question for me on the special services change is this kind of – how did – give us kind of logic so you guys decide that you don’t want to be as engaged on the perpetual license side of the digital banking services and you want to probably develop more of your resources to those folks you are closing that have on a more of a recurring revenue basis some of these new deals which i think is probably what happened but how did you quantify that  million a quarter like was that just what was in the pipeline or were those contracts being negotiated that you just then said we’re not going do them kind of give us how you – to that robert eberle well so let me help a little on that so we did what we – we’re not going to say to customers were are not going to do something so that’s why we still have some level of those services what’s turning out is were having less of those services which were delighted it’s not the business we want to be in and also when we are selling a subscription transaction now there isn’t the revenue for those services and those services would be any services revenue we have would be recorded spread over the life of the subscription so it’s really two things driving it one is our strategic change from if you look back years ago we provide the number would be far more than  million if we did a  or year comparison it be probably  million lost in the quarter or services because we used to provide a lot of services around our software for larger banks today where we are selling a standard product and by design and strategy we will want to sell a standard product and we’re providing much less in services and then the other piece around that is of course the accounting when we are selling purely subscription and transaction revenue model brett huff okay and then just rolling forward a little bit to guidance for fiscal  one of the metrics you gave rick was you reiterated the percent change i think you said  to  subs and trans you didn’t reiterate the  million number is that because the base will be smaller this year because there is lower services and can you give us any number from the  if possible richard booth brett you heard me exactly correctly for  we adjusted for currency and pro services and currency is extremely hard to predict we do see a continuation of a similar trend for services and well be coming back in the q call with full  guidance brett huff okay ill get back in the queue thank you operator and our next question is from the line of george sutton with craighallum capital please go ahead jason palmer hey good afternoon guys its jason on for george robert eberle hi jason jason palmer i wanted to dig in a little bit further on the acceleration that you are seeing in arr you mentioned that about half that comes from paymodex id assume that’s from the customer wins that we’ve seen on the vendor pay model so maybe you can dig into that and just a little bit more on the balance of the acceleration robert eberle im glad you asked the question because actually what i said is half of that is from paymodex and new products so what i really was trying to make the point is that our investments are on track the big investments weve been making are around paymodex around the digital banking platform for example so over half of the new arr was from not just paymodex but it was paymodex and new products that weve had for actually less than a years time so it was really a point about our investments are well placed and we are seeing the return on those investments so the early indications of the return on those investments jason palmer okay and then i guess digging a little bit deeper then can you give any updates on what you are seeing in the cyber fraud market any kind of early feedback on the partnerselect launch robert eberle yes on partnerselect we’re building a pipeline we changed the product slightly as youll recall where weve broken out an additional capability so there is a little bit of change to those that were working with but we’re building the pipeline we’re delighted with the reception the product is getting in the market this ensures a long sales cycle so having just g at the end of september it will we wouldn’t have expected to sign any deals in this past quarter and we wouldn’t expect to sign any in this quarter but the reception of that product is good and its certainly going to be making a positive contribution to our financials going forward jason palmer and then anything on the cyber fraud robert eberle cyber fraud is in some ways actually what we’ve done is weve built out sales teams that are calling in the protocols and again we’re pleased with the pipeline we are doing well with the existing channel partners that team with the intellinx acquisition the upside opportunity which well be executing on as we move into fy  is were selling directly to the bottomline channel and be selling more as you know or may recall weve sold the product well and when it is combined with our banking platform it is a huge opportunity the ability to have a stop payment go directly into the payment application so we will continue to be leveraging that but lets roll with the cfrm ph capability and the market reception to that jason palmer perfect and then just a last one from me i wanted to see if you can give some more detail on the visa relationship maybe you can talk about how you are going to market with that and then maybe the breadth of the offering is it based on any key industries or are you kind of going after all industries robert eberle no what weve been doing with them so far is actually focused on bank relationships the bank relationships at your existing visa banks or banks that don’t have a card program today from a capability standpoint what this allows us to do it allows us to provide payers with the ability to execute any type of payments so now if they have existing card program or want to have a card program for a portion of the vendor community they can do that through paymodex leverage all the technology payment remittance state and other information and we by the way will make attractive economics on that and then the last piece i think it’s truly as i said in my remarks it is a true market validation you know there are a lot of different people that visa could partner with or a lot of people that would try to attempt to change the way business is paying or get paid with  billion in transaction volume to  and with  members we think we have established ourselves as a clear leader amongst those that are watching this space closely and we think that visa in addition to the specifics of opening new doors and providing new payment capability is also a huge validation jason palmer okay perfect thank you operator and our next question is from the line of wayne johnson with raymond james financial please go ahead wayne johnson hi yes good afternoon so news continues to be favorable regarding paymodex so congratulations on that my question is are we entering a phase do you think where there is going to be an acceleration of adoption by new customers for paymodex and is that being driven by additional resellers is it easier to install and enable and to use today can you kind of provide some color around that topic thank you robert eberle i think there is a couple of things id point to one is weve proven out the model and when you are talking to someone in the industry you cant point to anyone else thats doing or were talking about doing or leveraging our model and you can’t point to a significant number of vendors that are already engaged and it is much tougher to do we have crossed that point so in the key verticals we can point to and with many businesses we can point to a large number of the vendors onboard today and so that it is not a leap of faith that they are taking the second big thing is our relationship with bank of america a huge driver behind paymodex and that is continuing to move forward and move forward in meaningful ways it took a while for the bank to be behind the model and frankly for a big organization it makes sense to be out front with bottomline and other banks proved this was working before you are going to endorse the vendor pay model and now we have bank of america truly behind the vendor pay model so those would be the two biggest factors for me and then i think the next one we will see coming on will be the impact of these it is hard it is positive that is clear quantifying that what will that mean by when and what markets is very difficult to do today but this is our business hard piece that i think will drive on the momentum we are in fact seeing wayne johnson okay great i appreciate that and then the second question i have is a follow up if i may and i apologize if i missed this but did you guys reiterate your margin goals going forward richard booth yes we did wayne  to  in  and no impact on operating margin percentages in  wayne johnson i see and you guys still aspire to  mid s kind of operating margin longer term robert eberle yes well it is more than aspire if you take a look at the results in the quarter i mean the way we are going to get there is selling new subscription deals and those subscription deals and so weve aligned our business model again not to repeat all the remarks but last year of a headwind so we have difficult transition this year with services that we would have had software licenses that we would have had are no longer revenue and instead have the implementation costs and we have but we don’t get any of the services revenue or any other subscription revenue we complete that we start to see those revenues come on a relatively fixed cost base i mean costs will go up but they won’t go up as fast as revenue and the key to that is what new subscription is coming on our  million new arr in the quarter is huge and not all of that will show up in fiscal  as rick has already outlined but a good portion of that will and weve had actually a very strong first half or double the prior year so that is really the key to the  it is not only that we aspire a committable we have much more visibility each quarter as were booking more of these subscription deals wayne johnson so could you quantify what the recurring revenue is at the beginning of this quarter and going forward richard booth yes the recurring revenue as of this quarter is  of total revenue which is given on an annualized basis to  million wayne johnson yes that is right so we should extra and my question is i apologize thank you for giving for providing that so just going forward we should think hey at the beginning of every quarter we are starting at  we are good to go on that kind of rationale robert eberle i think that is right so about  is right subs and trans on that our subs and trans part of our subs and trans business is a fixed amount a good portion of our business is take paymodex for example transaction based so there is some level of variability but fundamentally what you are seeing is we are building a very predictable business yes wayne johnson terrific thank you very much operator and our next question is from the line of mayank tandon with needham and company please go ahead mayank tandon thank you good evening first rick another question on guidance i know you said you are reaffirming the  operating margin target but given that the revenue base is lower should we expect some impact on earnings i think the street has got you a  and  respectively for the next two quarters what to expect there will be some impact from the lower revenue base on those eps numbers robert eberle i think it’s fair to assume that there will be some impact as you know we are naturally hedged on much of the foreign exchange and we did a good job managing expenses but there may be some impact there mayank tandon okay all right fair enough and then most of my questions have been answered but i do want to ask you about future ma strategy or how are you thinking about that i mean given the strong arr numbers are you going to be focused more on the organic front for now or should we expect you to be opportunistic in terms of ma robert eberle well it is a little bit of both but it is certainly we are going to be driving the organic growth opportunities we have in front of us and most importantly we are not going to do anything to disrupt that so we are not going to have a dilutive transaction that would disrupt the results the favorable results so that we can see and with the second quarter sales just we can start to get more visibility around so no we will not do a dilutive transaction i think what we are seeing in the market we would look at opportunities opportunistically we are always interested in consolidating a competitor or transactions of those types but the bar is raised in terms of what we would look for in a transaction i also think pricing in this market is still very difficult so we feel our timing to be focused on organic growth initiatives and bottomline fits pretty well is what we are seeing generally in the ma market mayank tandon if i can just follow up with one more question rob in terms of healthcare i know in the past youve talked about that as being one of the secular growth drivers for bottomline we haven’t heard much about that lately has that changed with all the regulation or do you still think that longer term that scenario that you might want to be more aggressive in whether its organically or through ma robert eberle what had happened so it certainly is an opportunity for us in the place and that is a big opportunity is around the cyber fraud and risk management if you recall we really looked at the technology and capability for our banking markets and our corporate customers and what we discovered is the organization we combined with are required to bring on this capability had some hospital customers and it is a fabulous fit patient privacy and data security is critical because the healthcare setting is really the holy grail everything is there so security number credit cards all personal information and under hipaa when there is a breach those organizations have to disclose that so reputational risk is huge practical risk is huge for both financial fraud and theft of different medications and private patient privacy we announced a major deal with cedarssinai in the may timeframe and were in the process of implementing that so that will really be the big kick off for us when we get that fully live then we would expect to go to market and bring on other hospitals under that platform so i apologize if it was too long an answer but yes healthcare is a great opportunity for us and even bigger opportunity now with patient privacy and data security what else i would add is healthcare has been a wonderful vertical for us for paymodex we typically just refer to it as paymodex but we have a number of significant healthcare providers and its one of the verticals where because we’ve got a number of providers on the vendor pay model each time we go into a new hospital chain and healthcare organization we have a pretty good percentage of their existing vendors that are already enrolled mayank tandon all right thats very helpful thank you operator and our next question is from the line of gary prestopino with barrington research please go ahead gary prestopino hi rick rob i couldn’t hurdle ph down quicker what did you say was the processing volume for paymode was that  richard booth gary it’s a  billion was processed through the network in calendar   billion and we have over  members so vendors in the payment in the network gary prestopino okay and then im just a little confused rick when you went through the guidance and you lowered the sales expectations you said there will be no concurrent impact on profitability and then one of the questioners asked will there be an impact and you said yes there will be so could you maybe straighten that out will there or will there not be richard booth so we focused on profitability as an operating income margin the  within that and we expect there may be some small impact and the bottom line down to eps but not material gary prestopino okay so it’s the  operating margin… richard booth yes exactly gary prestopino okay that is fine that clears that out thank you and then couple of things you that the new banking deal that you signed the west coast bank did you say that that was larger than the one you announced last quarter which you said was like somewhere between  million and  million deal overall richard booth yes it was gary prestopino okay is it much bigger or can you elaborate or you cant robert eberle yes again half of our attendance on the earnings calls is competitors so im not going to give out the exact pricing on that but it was it’s a seven figure annual subscription and it’s a multi – it is a sevenyear deal so it’s a very attractive transaction gary prestopino okay and then last question real quickly as you look at your pipeline is it new business is it pretty well diversified across all of your key products or is there one area where you are seeing a lot more interest robert eberle yes that’s one of the things i really like about the position we sit in is weve got a number of growth drivers and hopefully it comes away from the commentary but we had a real strong quarter paymodex real strong with digital banking and i think coming behind them weve got opportunities with cyber fraud risk management and then also the partnerselect so we have across the board which was part of what we did about a year and a quarter ago when we were making a bigger investment in product we really were setting ourselves up as you just identified in multiple different product sets in verticals to drive next level growth and that’s really where we sit today gary prestopino okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question is from the line of chris kennedy with william blair please go head chris kennedy hey guys thanks for taking my question rick just a clarification one more time on guidance did you confirm the  to  subs and trans growth target for fiscal  richard booth for fiscal we confirmed the  to  subs and trans growth for  no change to fiscal  growth so impressively yes chris kennedy okay great and then can you just talk a little bit more about your visibility and how these new signings will when they will actually hit the income statement and how that’s – how we can track that going forward robert eberle well probably both are the front end and the first thing id will tell you though at a product level is it really varies by product and in some cases it also will vary by an estimation of what will that transaction volume be so in some instances it can be a modular capability that we could be live for a fixed amount in a matter of six months in other instances it could be something like paymodex where somebody could be live in even as quick as a quarter but it will take three years to fully ramp in our estimates the digital banking product will probably be on a full platform could be  months or less live as much as  months and that will have during that time period were of course absorbing all the services and implementation costs without having any revenue so i probably didn’t help you a bit because the short answer is it varies it varies by product and it varies by whether it is going up instantly whether its going up and goes to a full fixed rate subscription or its transaction volume is increasing over time what we do think across all of these products is there is always opportunity to grow as the customer grows particularly in the transaction based pricing and then to grow it with by adding new capabilities into those platforms so we would expect to actually realize over time a number bigger than the arr weve given today assuming were effective in years to come in selling new additional capabilities and those businesses weve sold to on a transaction basis if their business grows chris kennedy okay great and one last one if i could on the  operating margin could you just give us a roadmap on kind of what the gross margin would be and then kind of what – where the leverage will be on the expense side thanks richard booth certainly i think the most important thing is to focus on our arr production which gives us great visibility into subs and trans growth the subs and trans growth with our continuing strong gross margins there against a fixed cost base provides the room that we need for gross had an operating income margin expansion chris kennedy okay all right thank you operator and our next question is from the line of brett huff with stephens inc please go ahead brett huff hey just a couple of follow ups for you guys the  to  fiscal  subs and trans rev growth guide is that constant currency richard booth implicitly because we didn’t adjust currency when we were doing that model brett huff okay richard booth as currently continues to fluctuate the total amount will vary but the percentage will be the same brett huff okay and then i want to make sure i heard the number right  did you call them now members or vendors richard booth vendors or members we use the term so it is what you think of as a vendor but yes we call them members brett huff okay the paymode deal growth rate slowed a little bit or the number of deals closed any thoughts i think it was  over the last quarter and maybe  or  this quarter any thoughts on that or what the pipeline looks like robert eberle we had some large deals in there too so the pipeline is strong the momentum is strong i think hopefully weve not  i wouldn’t expect us to go from  to  to  to   deals is a wonderful run rate to be at and it was a nice mix of deals so pipeline is strong and i think we will continue to see deals in this range in the range from  to  range and couldn’t be happier with where that is going now brett huff okay and then in the digital banking you guys have had two quarters and two really nice wins one question on this digital banking deal this time it will also include the any of the fraud functionality robert eberle no in this case it did not but that is always a capability we could be adding in this case though what is interesting is this particular customer was on an existing platform or was already using our customer acquisition solution which provides the ability to bring on new customers over any channel so it can be a mobile phone it can be an ipad it can be pc but it allows them to initiate customer relationships so it really plays to what we are doing by broadening the capabilities that we can provide banks and be coming someone that can help them in their digital battle for continued customer retainment and growth it was wonderful to see an existing customer dramatically expanding their relationship with bottomline brett huff and then what is the pipeline look like for those kind of deals i know there is probably some in the pipeline or can you give us a sense is it kind of thing where that could happen every couple of quarters where we have a big deal like that here robert eberle yes i think  i saw – it could happen thats what every couple of quarters makes sense what the pipeline there is two different things i would say one the level of excitement and reception to our offering has been outstanding what drives pipeline now was more than just that it is timeframe need – the funding are all part of that so the reception to our new offering has been outstanding what will ultimately drive pipeline and like you said a deal every couple of quarters of this size is banks that have that funding have that need and the timeframe where we have less control over that but we couldn’t be in a better position at the top of the pipeline at the top of the funnel if you will of organizations that are impressed with and interested in bringing out some of the technologies weve now announced brett huff okay and then last one i hate to belabor the guidance question i just want to make sure ive got it is it fair for us to assume a reasonable services margin and i don’t know what reasonable is maybe  pro forma ebit services margins on the revenue that is going away in order to flow that through to the bottom line and is it fair just to assume a company average margin on the fx given your natural hedging should that get us close to the right number on the bottom line robert eberle i think those are reasonable assumptions brett brett huff okay that is all i needed thank you so much operator now i will turn it back to our presenters for closing remarks robert eberle well thank you thank you for your interest we are thrilled with the second quarter particularly as we have indicated the progress we have made in providing indications of the return on the investments  million in new arr in moving ourselves forward we think we are in a very good potion and couldn’t be more confident about our ability to generate continued shareholder value so i appreciate your interest and we look forward to reporting on the third quarter at the end of april operator

highly bullish on the cdp ’s pinned  points on this château sixtine calling it “an intense red with cascading layers” of dark fruit and spice today fourthgeneration winemaker jean marc diffonty is releasing some of the greatest wines ever to come out of château sixtine an “innovative visionary” according to robert parker diffonty has successfully modernized the ancient property turning out voluptuous blends of flowing elegance and finegrained tannins — never more so than in the knockout  vintage just  cases for lovers of classic cdp jean marc took the business over from his father félicien — a charismatic if grumpy local character who served as mayor of châteauneufdupape for three decades a member of the oldguard félicien’s winemaking style had grown rigid jean marc sought new expressions for the storied estate employing temperaturecontrolled stainless steel tanks drastically lowering yields and experimenting with new oak in  these measures resulted in an instant classic   a watershed vintage  in southern rhône had vignerons practically jumping for joy  the season started out cold but by early summer had warmed significantly ripening accelerated tempered by rainfall and cool nights as the old vines across château sixtine’s  acres produced tiny berries of awesome power and freshness open up now and linger over a mesmerizing floralscented aromatic profile that evolves for  hours or put this brooding beauty to rest for another  years tasting notes  chateau sixtine chateauneufdupape wine access the  chateau sixtine is a dark and deep wine with brilliant crimson color pure intense dark berry and earthy aromas on the palate the mellow wellintegrated oak adds a layer of silkiness a wellbalanced tannin structure precision and just the right balance of fruit give this wine its full personality its delicate subtle scents lead you to a delightfully long fresh finish the silkiness of the wine dominates throughout the tasting a jewel of a wine  points wine spectator an intense red with cascading flavors of dark fig cassis blackberry pâte de fruit and plum sauce underscored by notes of dark licorice and ganache the long finish features lots of black tea and graphite

close nothing here yet check out our favorites checkout regions varietals wineries wine growing regions across the wine world different regions are known for both producing different grapes and different styles of wine the distinction between old world wine regions and new world wine regions is particularly important as a sweeping generalization old world regions are known for producing wines that are more austere and terroir driven while new world regions are known for producing wines with greater intensity for example cabernet sauvignon grapes grown in france will likely produce wines marked by earthiness and subtle fruit flavors while cabernet sauvignon grapes grown in california will likely produce wines that are more fruitforward but different wine regions are also often associated with the production of different grapes for example within france bordeaux is associated with red wines made primarily from cabernet sauvignon merlot and cabernet franc grapes while burgundy is associated with red wines made from the pinot noir grape use this page to find toprated wines from wine regions throughout the world and learn about each region’s winemaking profile europe
