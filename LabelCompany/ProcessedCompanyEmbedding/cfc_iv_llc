earned by us controlled foreign corporation drastically changed with the introduction of subpart f into the internal revenue code in  subpart f deals with the us taxation of amounts earned by controlled foreign corporations cfcs it provides that certain types of income of cfcs though undistributed must be included in the gross income of the us shareholder in the year the income is earned by the cfc it is important to note that the subpart f sections of the code take precedence over the foreign personal holding company sections further the rules contained in subpart fare to be applied after the income of the cfc has been adjusted to conform to us income tax concepts under certain circumstances current earnings of a cfc may be deferred from us tax if not actually distributed to the us shareholder since domestic entities are currently taxed it is essential that the relationships between cfcs and domestic entities be at arm’s length any allocations of income and deductions between the cfc and its related organizations under irc section  take precedence over the application of the provisions of subpart f the provisions of subpart f contain many general rules special rules definitions exceptions exclusions and limitations that require careful consideration   preliminary information needed the first step in beginning any examination should be to become familiar with the scope and mode of the taxpayer’s operations eg the products and entities involved etc the following information and documents should be secured to meet this objective obtain consolidated financial statements if available showing balance sheets and operating results of all related and foreign entities obtain certified or other statements of the individual foreign entities remember the regulations provide for english translations or the services of a qualified interpreter where the books or records are not maintained in english obtain a statement from the taxpayer characterizing the operations of the various related foreign entities obtain corporate books including the minutes of corporate meetings of the domestic taxpayer and of the related foreign entities if available obtain original form  andor form –f or copies thereof if such returns were filed for any related foreign entity obtain copies of all foreign tax returns filed by related foreign entities in which the taxpayer is a us shareholder obtain or prepare organizational charts showing the relationship of all domestic and foreign entities  be sure stock ownership percentages are included ask for a briefing

examine copies of existing company publications manuals instructions or correspondence that set forth procedures dealing with foreign income reporting obtain and examine the original forms  or copies thereof if such returns were filed subpart f contains many relief provisions the early stages of the examination should be devoted to determining the applicability of subpart f and their exclusions etc starting with those most easily verified audit steps requiring detailed documentation and extensive analyzes should be pursued only after determining that the more apparent relief provisions are not applicable   identification and qualifications of cfcs and us shareholders us shareholder defined  a us shareholder is a us person defined in irc section c who owns directly indirectly or constructively  percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in a foreign corporation controlled foreign corporation defined  a controlled foreign

foreign corporations determine direct indirect and constructive ownership of voting power of stock in any foreign corporations it is important to note that the ownership rules for defining a us shareholder relate to voting power of stock ies should be alert to attempts to shift formal voting power to avoid qualification see regs –g and –b and the examples thereunder for illustrations for purposes of determining whether the foreign corporation is a cfc determine the value of stock including whether any shares have different rights resulting in different values and ownership of value of

suggesting foreign activity the cfc’s stock record books may show ownership of a subsidiary by applying the indirect ownership rules a subsidiary of the cfc if ownership is sufficient may be considered a cfc if the taxpayer owns  percent or more of a foreign corporation an analysis of the records may indicate the existence of other us shareholders analysis might disclose other owners of the stock that constructively or indirectly might qualify the foreign corporation as a cfc if the taxpayer has adopted a new accounting period verify the conditions of irc  the proposed regulations

to ascertain if the cfc owns most of other foreign corporations determine if its interests along with other stockholders suggest that any of these foreign corporations are cfcs by indirect or constructive ownership by the us person or perhaps another us person if investments are in us assets this fact could indicate possible income under irc sections ab and  due to an increase in earnings invested in us property be aware that any passive income received by the cfc claimed under irc section c and c as excluded from subpart f should be checked against the cfc’s records to determine that the income does qualify for the exclusion as required by the regulations to qualify for exclusion the answer must be a yes to the following questions if rents or royalties are excluded from this type

withdrawals of previously excluded subpart f income and investments in us property the audit of a given year may give rise to the determination of correct earnings and profits at different time levels as follows current taxable year prior years beginning after december   for purposes of irc section a any prior year beginning with the most recent and going back as far as february   for purposes of irc section a post  pool for computing deemed paid taxes with respect to irc section  inclusions   earnings and profits guidelines determine that the proper books and records were used to compute the profit and loss statement from which the determination of earnings and profits was calculated determine that the earnings and profits have not been reduced by amounts included in gross income of us shareholders under irc section a review the written statement constituting the elections made by the cfc shareholders ascertain whether there have been any subsequent modifications or revocations as to these elections determine if the proper adjustments have been made to reflect us accounting standards for example determine if accounting practices tend to clearly reflect income scrutinize asset accounts from time of acquisition and determine method of asset acquisition to ascertain that when the assets are reflected at cost it is historical cost see treas §reg – b for the definition of historical costs verify that historical cost is the basis for depreciation depletion or amortization be alert to undervalued assets or overvalued liabilities that may be allowed under foreign law scrutinize profit and loss statements for unallowable deductions scrutinize balance sheets for arbitrary reserves and determine how they were established inspect income and expense accounts to verify that income and expenses have not been equalized over two or more accounting periods for post  tax years confirm that earnings and profits are maintained in the cfcs functional currency in accordance with the rules of treas reg §–tg determine if the proper adjustments have been made to reflect us tax standards such as method of accounting provisions under irc section  inventories under irc section  and  depreciation under irc section  compensation plans under irc section a and elections made under other applicable provisions of the code determine that the controlling us shareholders of a cfc have complied with all the requirements for an election adoption or change of an accounting method or period where the controlling us shareholder is included in a us consolidated return with its us parent elections adoptions or changes of an accounting method or period must be made by the us parent remember timely filed statements are required by the regulations all other known us shareholders must be notified with respect to any action taken   exclusion of previously taxed earnings and profits the purpose of irc section  is to avoid double taxation that could occur when amounts that have been previously included in the gross income of a us shareholder under irc section  are actually distributed to such shareholders irc section  provides that for any taxable year earnings and profits of a foreign corporation attributable to amounts included in gross income of a us shareholder under irc section  will not again be included in gross income of such shareholders when distributed in addition amounts included in gross income of a us shareholder will not be included in gross income of a foreign corporation when such amounts are distributed through a chain of ownership see irc section c for calculation of exchange gain or loss on a distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits   adjustments to basis of stock guidelines basis of stock should be increased by the amount of the undistributed irc section  a income in the us shareholder’s tax return and decreased by a distribution previously taxed as irc section a income   special rules for foreign tax credit income included in gross income under the provisions of subpart f as a deemed dividend is eligible for the indirect foreign tax credit credits so allowed will not be allowed again when actual distributions are made in situations where foreign taxes are imposed at the time of actual distribution a withholding tax a foreign tax credit will be allowed where otherwise allowable even though the amounts distributed are not taxable because they were previously included in the us shareholder’s income the workings of irc section  with respect to the inclusion of subpart f income are generally similar to the workings of irc sections  and  with respect to a dividend distribution from a foreign entity the gross up provision of irc section  similarly applies the receipt of the funds representing previously taxed earnings and profits for purposes of irc section a does not produce additional indirect foreign tax credits but may lead to an additional direct foreign tax credit or increase in limitation under irc section b under treas reg §– the year in which the subpart f income was reported will be called the year of inclusion the year in which the funds are received relative to the included income will be called the year of exclusion   foreign tax credit guidelines if in the year of exclusion the taxpayer claims a deduction for foreign taxes paid on the amount excluded under irc section a check the federal income tax return of the year of inclusion to verify that no foreign tax credit was claimed relative to the income included under irc section a with respect to the increase under irc section b in the limitation under irc section a verify that the increase in the irc section  limitation of the year of inclusion is correctly computed the amount of foreign taxes allowed as credit because of such increases in the year of inclusion is properly computed the credit allowed may have exceeded the taxes deemed paid on the income included under irc section a the increase in limitation under this section for intervening years is properly computed the increase in limitation in the year of exclusion does not exceed the taxes paid accrued or deemed paid for such taxable year on the amount to be excluded under irc section a note note that if the increase in limitation under irc section b and treas reg §– for a taxable year of exclusion exceeds the tax before any credits against tax imposed by code chapter  such excess will be considered an overpayment of tax the tax is refundable or creditable according to code chapter  irc section  and following   general rules and record keeping requirements of us shareholders treas reg §– describes the record keeping requirements of the us shareholder the regulations specifically require that a us shareholder will within a reasonable time after demand by the area director give the area director such permanent books of account or records as are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of irc section  and irc section c or true copies thereof as are reasonably demanded if such books and records are not maintained in the english language either an accurate english translation of such books and records or the services of a qualified interpreter satisfactory to the director of field operations the requirements of irc section  and irc section c will be considered satisfied if the books or records produced are sufficient to verify for the taxable year the subpart f income and exclusions therefrom of the cfc the previously excluded subpart f income of such corporation withdrawn from qualified investment irc section  the increase in earnings invested by such corporation in us property   special rules and record keeping requirements of ussharedholders reg –c provides special rules that state that verification of the subpart f income of the cfc for the taxable year is not required if either it can be shown to the satisfaction of the director of field operations that the locus and the nature of such corporation’s activities make it unlikely that the foreign base company income of such corporation exceeded  percent of its gross income for the taxable year or if certain conditions are met for certain insurance companies remember that the burden of demonstrating that these conditions exist is upon the taxpayers if they cannot carry this burden then the general rules apply the special rules refer solely to relief from maintaining records to verify subpart f income of the cfc the taxpayer must still maintain records to verify previously excluded subpart f income and the increase in investments in us property by the cfc les should recognize that submission of the required records can be extremely burdensome upon taxpayers if requested indiscriminately ies should carefully consider such requests request only records most pertinent to each particular situation if the taxpayer has not maintained adequate records the taxpayer should be advised of the nature of the inadequacies and the requirements of the regulations exhibits irm  and irm – provide guidelines for obtaining information books and records of us and foreign entities more internal revenue manual our
