awarded appellee power line packaging inc power line restitution interest and storage fees based upon claims of unjust enrichment quantum meruit and piercing the corporate veil upon careful review we affirm based upon the opinions of the honorable gary b gilman this matter arises out of a failed business venture between the parties in which appellants requested that power line manufacture a new

thereafter appellants filed a timely notice of appeal and courtordered concise statement of errors complained of on appeal pursuant to parap b on appeal appellants raise the following issues for our review  whether the trial court abused its discretion andor erred as a matter of law in finding any justifiable reliance on the part of power line with respect to its claims of misrepresentation  whether the trial court abused its discretion andor erred as a matter of law in finding upon power lines claim for quantum meruit  that power line conferred a benefit upon anyone andor  that anybody appreciated andor retained any such benefit brief for appellant at  we note that our role in reviewing nonjury trial verdicts is to determine whether the findings of the trial court are supported by competent evidence and whether the trial court committed error in any application of the law the findings of fact of the trial judge must be given the same weight and effect on appeal as the verdict

if its findings are premised on an error of law rissi v cappella  ad   pa super  instantly the trial court made detailed findings of fact showing that appellants engaged in a course of conduct that

corporate assets to further ones own personal interests    by intermingling his personal interests with the corporations interests where appropriate the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil will be applied to a limited liability company we find that the opinions by the honorable gary b gilman dated september   and february   comprehensively address the issues raised on appeal and we affirm on that basis we direct the parties to attach a copy of both decisions in the event of further proceedings order affirmed power line packaging inc v hermes calgonthg acquisition llc et al defendants appeal this courts order which found that the defendants had been unjustly enriched as a result of unlawful failure to reimburse plaintiff for expenses associated with development and manufacture of a product line of personal care consumer care products this court held that defendants issues raised on appeal are without merit appealed to the superior court civil law — piercing a corporate veil — admission of testimony of an expert — quantum meruit — quasi contract — misrepresentation by defendant concerning a new product line  the elements necessary to prove unjust enrichment are  benefits conferred on the defendant by the plaintiff  appreciation of the benefits on defendant and  acceptance and retention of such benefits under such circumstances that it would be inequitable for defendant to retain the benefit without payment of value  the trial court is vested with wide discretion in deciding whether to allow the admission of expert testimony into evidence and is not subject to reversal absent a clear abuse of discretion  while there is no clear test or wellsettled rule in pennsylvania as to when the corporate veil may be pierced and when it may not be pierced courts have held veil piercing to be appropriate when the court must prevent fraud illegality or injustice or when recognition of the corporate entity would defeat public policy or shield someone from liability from a crime pearson v component tech corp  frd  rd cir   the commonwealth court of pennsylvania has enunciated four factors that must be considered if the business entity is to be disregarded and the corporate veil is to be pierced those specific factors are  undercapitalization  failure to adhere to corporate formalities  substantial intermingling of corporate and personal affairs and  use of the

the plaintiff william t dudeck eastburn and gray pc for the defendants gilman j february   opinion i introduction defendants hermes calgonthg acquisition llc dba soleburybrands franco s pettinato mr pettinato and joseph falsetti mr falsetti collectively referred to as defendants appeal from this courts decision and order of september   which found in favor of plaintiff power line packaging inc power line and against defendants on plaintiffs claims of breach of implied contract promissory estoppel quantum meruit fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation a protracted nonjury trial took place on february  and   and on september   after voluminous posttrial submissions by the parties this court set forth extensive findings of fact conclusions of law and an accompanying decision and order in our opinion dated september   that decision and order is incorporated herein a copy is attached hereto as exhibit a we determined that the defendants had been unjustly enriched as a result of unlawful failure to reimburse plaintiff for expenses associated with development and manufacture of a product line of personal care consumer products for which defendants and plaintiff had entered into a binding contract those expenses were incurred by plaintiff while developing the product line of personal care products a mist a lotion and a shave gel with six fragrances each and by purchasing requisite materials and supplies the product line we also determined that the corporate veil of defendants llc should be pierced and that defendants mr pettinato and mr falsetti should be held individually liable to plaintiff along with defendant hermes calgonthg acquisition llc for the losses plaintiff has incurred as a result of defendants actions accordingly we awarded plaintiff power line the sum of  which represented reimbursement for expenses plaintiff had incurred for materials for labor for design work and for storage of materials further we awarded plaintiff prejudgment interest of  for a total award in favor of plaintiff and against defendants of  in restitution in addition we determined that interest was due in the amount of  per day from the date of the order and that storage fees of  per month commencing in october  were to be added to power lines award ii procedural and factual background the appellate court is referred to section i of exhibit a attached hereto we supplement the procedural and factual background as follows following our decision and order of september   defendants hermes calgonthg acquisition llc franco s pettinato and joseph falsetti filed a motion for posttrial relief on october   which was denied by this court pursuant to an order of november   subsequently on december   defendants filed a notice of appeal to the superior court however the september   decision and order of this court had never been reduced to judgment by any of the parties so the superior court notified defendants counsel that his appeal was procedurally improper according to the docket this error was subsequently remedied and on february   judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff and against defendants in the amount noted in our order of september   we submit this opinion at this time then under the assumption that the superior court will consider defendants appeal on the merits on december   this court ordered defendants to file a concise statement of errors complained of on appeal pursuant to pa rap b defendants filed their statement on january   iii statement of errors complained of on appeal the defendants concise statement of matters complained of on appeal filed pursuant to pa rap b is recited verbatim as follows  whether this court abused its discretion andor erred as a matter of law in finding as part of any liability of defendants or anyone of them in this matter any justifiable reliance on the part of plaintiff power line packaging inc power line  whether as the underlying substantive basis for all liability in this matter this court abused its discretion andor erred as a matter of law in finding upon power lines claim for quantum meruit where as a matter of law  power line conferred no benefits upon the company and  the company did not appreciate andor retain any benefits from power line  whether this court abused its discretion andor erred as a matter of law in admitting the proffered expert testimony of peter fascia esquire cpa llm  whether this court abused its discretion andor erred as a matter of law in piercing the companys corporate veil in light of a the properly admitted and credible evidence at trial and b the controlling findings conclusions and holdings set forth in advanced telephone systems inc v comnet professional mobile radio llc  ad   pa super   whether in the alternative to the foregoing this court abused its discretion andor erred as a matter of law in awarding power line any damages for labor or warehousing where the former was speculative and the latter has been incurred at its own election iv discussion our findings of fact and the conclusions of law upon which we based our decisions in this case have been set forth comprehensively in our  page decision and order attached as exhibit a since our decision and order addresses the majority of defendants issues complained of on appeal our discussion herein is limited to supplemental explications of facts and law which support our decisions a standard of review in establishing the standard and scope of review applicable in an appeal from a nonjury verdict the superior court of pennsylvania has stated that our appellate role in cases arising from nonjury trial verdicts is to determine whether the findings of the trial court are supported by competent evidence and whether the trial court committed error in any application of the law the findings of fact of the trial judge must be given the same weight and effect on appeal as the verdict of a jury we consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict winner we will reverse the trial court only if its findings of fact are not supported by competent evidence in the record or if its findings are premised on an error of law rissi v cappella  ad   pasuper citation omitted the superior court has further indicated that we will respect a trial courts findings with regard to the credibility and weight of the evidence unless the appellant can show that the courts determination was manifestly erroneous arbitrary and capricious or flagrantly contrary to the evidence ecksel v orleans const co  ad    citation omitted jj deluca co v toll naval associates  ad   pa super  b this court properly concluded that power line justifiably relied on defendants representations and misrepresentations when it agreed to and in fact did manufacture the new product line requested by defendants we reference our attached decision and order noting that no less than  pages of facts have been cited which thoroughly address defendants fraudulent deceptive and negligent conduct along with power lines justifiable reliance see exhibit a findings of fact   through   pp  to be justifiable reliance upon the representation of another must be reasonable porreco v porreco  pa   ad    opinion announcing the judgment of the court whether the party claiming to have been defrauded relied upon the false representation is a question of fact silverman  ad at  eigen v textron lycoming reciprocating engine div  ad   pa super  as factfinder we determined that defendants set out on a course of conduct to induce power line to manufacture the personal care line power line relied upon the misrepresentations of defendants that they were operating as a wellfunded business and with established contracts for selling the product line to third parties the deceptive powerpoint presentation made by defendants for plaintiff along with the deceptive official company info email defendants sent to plaintiff were illustrative of defendants scheme all of power lines efforts were engaged in the formulation production and completion of the product line at defendants request with deadlines which defendants represented to plaintiffs were necessary to meet requirements retailers had imposed upon defendants see exhibit a conclusions of law  pages  see also conclusions of law  pages  defendants assertion that power line did not justifiably rely on defendants numerous representations andor misrepresentations about defendants relationships with purported retailers and their ability to successfully market the new product line at stores such as walgreens and shoppers drug mart shoppers is wholly without merit on the contrary it is clear that power line reasonably and justifiably relied upon defendants misrepresentations to its detriment power line suffered significant damages as a result thereof c this court properly concluded that power line conferred benefits upon defendants whereby defendants were unjustly enriched it is wellestablished that courts sitting in equity hold broad powers to grant relief that will result in an equitable resolution of a dispute williams twp bd of supervisors v williams twp emergency co inc  ad   pa cmwlth  in addition a trial court must formulate an equitable remedy that is consistent with the relief requested    id citing north mountain water supply co v troxell  a   a cause of action in quasicontract for quantum meruit a form of restitution is made out where one person has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another a quasicontract imposes a duty not as a result of any agreement whether express or implied but in spite of the absence of an agreement when one party receives unjust enrichment at the expense of another ameripro search inc v fleming steel co  ad   pa super  therefore a claim of quantum meruit raises the issue of whether a party has been unjustly enriched and in order to prove such claim a party must successfully prove the elements of unjust enrichment mitchell v moore  ad   pa super  the elements necessary to prove unjust enrichment are  benefits conferred on defendant by plaintiff  appreciation of such benefits by defendant and  acceptance and retention of such benefits under such circumstances that it would be inequitable for defendant to retain the benefit without payment of value id at  the application of the doctrine depends on the particular factual circumstances of the case at issue in determining if the doctrine applies our focus is not on the intention of the parties but rather the most significant element of this equitable doctrine which is whether the enrichment of the defendant is unjust the doctrine does not apply simply because the defendant may have benefited as a result of the actions of the plaintiff styer v hugo  ad   affd  ad   to sustain the claim of unjust enrichment power line established that defendants wrongfully secured or passively received a benefit that was unconscionable for them to retain mitchell supra at  quoting torchia v torchia  ad   pa super  here defendants requested and induced power line to develop the product line for defendants and to purchase and store the requisite materials with assurances that power line would be paid by defendants for their expenditures and efforts power line did so and conferred on defendants the benefits of development of formulation of and manufacture of the product line along with purchase of and storage of the necessary materials for defendants use although defendants repeatedly assured power line that they would pay for the purchase and storage of the materials and for the formula development for the product line defendants failed to pay power line for anything see further discussion herein section f infra defendants wrongful refusal to actually pay plaintiff for the product line which has resulted in defendants not taking physical possession of it should not result in defendants being able to defeat this unjust enrichment finding power line conferred substantial benefits upon defendants placing them in a position to profit from sale of the product line to third parties unfortunately defendants failed to consummate such sales and such failure has continued to the present day it is indisputable however that benefits have indeed been conferred upon defendants by plaintiff and that defendants have actual knowledge of these facts accordingly our conclusion that defendants have been unjustly enriched at the expense of plaintiff power line is wholly supported by the credible evidence and the law d this court properly admitted the testimony of plaintiffs expert peter fascia esquire cpa llm the only issue raised in defendants statement of errors complained of on appeal that was not exhaustively addressed in our september   decision and order is the admission of the testimony of power lines expert accountant mr fascia as explained more fully below we concluded that mr fascias testimony was relevant and was properly admitted into evidence on january   defendants filed a motion in limine to preclude the expert testimony of mr fascia that motion raised an issue that was reiterated in defendants motion for posttrial relief defendants asserted that mr fascias written report of july   supported their claim that he should not be permitted to testify as an expert witness in this matter because of the following a expert testimony is not necessary on these subjects of factual inquiry b he is doing nothing more than acting as a sort of cocounsel and parroting the arguments of power lines counsel with a request that they now be received as and accorded the weight of the testimony c he is invading the province of the factfinder and d even if none of the foregoing were true his opinions are not relevant to a limited liability company as opposed to a corporation defendants motion in limine  p  defendants motion for posttrial relief  p  at the outset of the trial we heard brief argument on defendants motion in limine understanding defendants concerns that mr fascia is an attorney we addressed the motion as follows i understand that mr fascia is an attorney so there are some issues addressed in the report that come close to attorney opinions as opposed to economic opinions    the motion at this point is denied without prejudice to mr dudeck defendants counsel raising objections given the testimony nt  pp  expert testimony is admissible under pennsylvania rule of evidence pare  which provides a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge skill experience training or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if a the experts scientific technical or other specialized knowledge is beyond that possessed by the average layperson b the experts scientific technical or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue and c the experts methodology is generally accepted in the relevant field pare  a trial court is vested with wide discretion in deciding whether to allow the admission of expert testimony into evidence and is not subject to reversal absent a clear abuse of discretion daddona v thind  ad   pa cmwlth  mr fascia is a certified public accountant with an llm in taxation he also happens to be an attorney as a cpa he reviewed the relevant company formation documents the operating agreement and the financial records and tax returns of defendant hermes calgonthg acquisition llc he rendered opinions regarding the capitalization and solvency of the hermes entity mr fascia expressed his professional opinion that the company did not adhere to traditional formalities necessary for the operation of a limited liability company nor did it adhere to the requirements contained in the operating agreement mr fascia also opined on other technical accounting issues this court was aware that mr fascia is an attorney as well as a cpa and we were careful to evaluate his opinions only as they pertained to accounting as opposed to legal issues mr fascias testimony clearly related to issues that were beyond the skills and knowledge of a layperson his opinions were provided following generally accepted accounting analysis the weight to be afforded his expert testimony was a determination within this courts discretion accordingly mr fascias testimony was properly admitted into evidence and defendants assertion that admission of his expert accounting opinions constituted an abuse of discretion is meritless e this court properly pierced the corporate veil of hermes calgonthg acquisition llc based on the testimony and evidence elicited along with application of pertinent law while there appears to be no clear test or wellsettled rule in pennsylvania as to exactly when the corporate veil may be pierced and when it may not be pierced courts have held veilpiercing to be appropriate when the court must prevent fraud illegality or injustice or when recognition of the corporate entity would defeat public policy or shield someone from liability for a crime pearson v component tech corp  fd   d cir  it has been held that the corporate veil is properly pierced whenever one in control of a corporation uses that control or corporate assets to further ones own personal interests in such circumstances the shareholder in effect pierces the corporate veil by intermingling his personal interests with the corporations interests advanced telephone

welfare  wl  pacmwlth  defendants rely on advanced telephone systems inc for the strong presumption in pennsylvania against piercing the corporate veil defendants however disregard the significance of the fact that the same case also notes that the limited liability company law of  contemplates that in the appropriate case the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil will be applied to a limited liability company  pa csa §  committee comment  advanced telephone systems supra at  fn in our decision and order of september   we considered the credible testimony presented by power line and the lack of credibility associated with testimony and evidence presented by the defendants the record revealed that all four factors as enunciated by the commonwealth court of pennsylvania that must be considered if the business entity form is to be disregarded and the corporate veil is to be pierced existed in this case those specific factors are as follows  undercapitalization  failure to adhere to corporate formalities  substantial intermingling of corporate and personal affairs and  use of the corporate form to perpetrate a fraud department of environmental resources v peggs run coal co  ad  pa cmwlth  see exhibit a findings of fact  pages  and exhibit a conclusions of law  pages  as noted in our conclusion of law  the pennsylvania legislature clearly intended to permit application of the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil to a limited liability company such as defendant hermes here when it enacted the pennsylvania limited liability company law  pa csa § et seq the credible evidence convincingly established here that defendant hermes llc was undercapitalized that defendants failed to adhere to corporate formalities that defendants intentionally disregarded the company operating agreement and that defendant mr falsetti without distinction commingled company funds with his personal funds further the credible evidence convincingly established that the company was used to perpetrate fraud by paying insiders rather than a known creditor power line and that defendants intentionally rendered the company insolvent we properly and lawfully determined then that this case was in fact an appropriate case where the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil should be applied to a limited liability company f this court properly awarded damages to power line for its labor incurred in creating the product line for defendants and for warehousing costs for storage of the product line defendants approached power line to develop the product line and defendants supplied power line with a spreadsheet labeled shoppers a third party retailer that listed the required quantities of the various product line items the powerpoint that defendants presented to power line boasted the companys us based success is in partnership with americas largest drug sector retailer walgreens with excess of  stores across the country although in reality defendants had not consummated either of the suggested binding partnerships or contracts with third parties or any similar relationships with others power line reasonably relied upon such representations and developed and produced the product line incurring costs associated with hundreds of hours of labor defendants sent email messages to power line stating that its time to rock and roll and reminded power line of dates that needed to be met given certain production requirements these directions reinforced power lines efforts in product formulations production and purchase of supplies which were reasonably commensurate with the representations made by defendants power line purchased  tubes  sprayers  unit cartons and  labels in coordination with the anticipated production for defendants defendant mr pettinato was aware based upon discussions with power line representatives that power line was purchasing thousands of long lead item component parts testimony revealed that defendants on at least four occasions represented that they would reimburse power line for the costs of the components these components were stored on  pallets each six feet high on july   mr pettinato sent an email to power line representatives which stated in part that the deal with shoppers continues to be delayed could you please fax me the invoices and your estimate of how many pallets im making arrangements with a warehouse local for you to store the material exhibit p unfortunately to the detriment of power line defendants never made arrangements for warehousing accordingly power line has necessarily incurred monthly warehousing costs since june  power lines labor efforts which were billed to defendants in the total amount of  were commensurate with the production needs that were dictated by defendants since the alleged shoppers deal never came to fruition power lines production efforts for defendants necessitated warehousing the product line a fact of which defendants were aware and for which defendants repeatedly claimed they would be financially responsible the evidence clearly establishes then that defendants assertions that power lines labor costs were based upon mere speculation and that warehousing costs for products manufactured for defendants were incurred at power lines own election are meritless v conclusion defendants have challenged this courts decision and order of september   wherein we found that defendants were unjustly enriched as a result of their failures in their roles as the directors and the individuals principally in charge of hermes calgonthg acquisition llc to pay plaintiff power line for the expenses it incurred at defendants request in developing and manufacturing the product line and purchasing the requisite materials and supplies in addition we determined that the corporate veil of the defendant llc should be pierced and that defendants mr pettinato and mr falsetti should be held individually liable to power line along with defendant hermes calgonthg acquisition llc for the losses plaintiff incurred as a result of defendants unlawful actions accordingly an equitable remedy of an award of restitution was appropriate we found that power line should be awarded the sum of  in addition to prejudgment interest of  for a total award of  further we awarded interest in the amount of  per day from the date of the order additionally storage fees of  per month commencing in october  were appropriately added to the award despite defendants unsubstantiated assertions that no fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations were made to power line the record evidenced a strategic pattern of deception by defendants which rendered power line the victim of defendants misconduct all of defendants errors complained of on appeal are meritless accordingly we respectfully submit that our decision and order of september   should be affirmed by the court gary b gilman j exhibit a in the court of common pleas of bucks

requirements of  pacs §  and  pacs §   the company operating agreement did not list mr falsetti as the manager and hermes calgonthg acquisition llc did not comply with the requirements of  pacs §  and  pacs §   ms sides and mr falsetti did not make any capital contribution to hermes calgonthg acquisition llc but significant company funds were eventually distributed to them  due to mr falsettis inability andor reluctance to explain where the initial funds for the company came from or who contributed them this court did not find mr falsetti credible in this regard  although the operating agreement states that the two members who contributed capital to the company and the amount of their contributions were rsb llc  and mr pettinato  neither the general ledger nor the company tax return support that representation  despite the existence of company documents with a multitude of names on them eg hermes llc solebury brands llc dana holdings llc hermes llc dba solebury brands llc solebury brands and solebury brands defendants did not provide power line with any documentation that had the name hermes calgonthg acquisition llc on it  ms barry did not know the name of the company hermes calgonthg acquisition llc on whose behalf she was allegedly working believing instead that it was solebury brands  since defendants failed to adhere to the necessary formalities since the company was undercapitalized and since company funds were distributed to individuals who were not members of hermes calgonthg acquisition llc the corporate veil should be pierced  this court agrees with plaintiffs expert accounting witness mr fascia who observed ironically the individual defendants in this case seek to shield themselves from personal liability by contending among other things that the company which falsetti once testified was never solidified now exists in order to avoid liability to power line see nt  pp   hermes calgonthg acquisition llc was an alter ego of mr falsetti who without distinction commingled company funds with his personal funds  in order for a companys participants to be shielded from personal liability the participants must remain distinct and separate from the company  the use of corporate funds for personal benefita—again particularly at a time of financial distress—also supports piercing the corporate veil lutyk  fsupp d at  see also schaffer  wl

such circumstances the shareholder in effect pierces the corporate veil by intermingling his personal interests with the corporations interests id  mr falsetti admitted that the company was his alter ego when he testified at trial that at his sole option i could have taken all of the money out of the company  the loan from ms sides to mr falsetti—and not to hermes calgonthg acquisition llc—also is clear evidence of alter ego and commingling although hermes calgonthg acquisition llc had no repayment obligations to ms sides mr falsetti directed that company funds were to be used to make interest payments on the loan that she made to him  mr falsetti did not directly contribute any money to hermes calgonthg acquisition llc but  was distributed from the company to him and he contended that he could have taken more see nt  p   hermes calgonthg acquisition llc was an alter ego of mr falsetti  the company was used to perpetrate fraud and defendants intentionally rendered it insolvent  defendants acknowledged their debt obligations to power line as confirmed by mr falsettis email response on june   to ms santucci after she wrote to mr falsetti stating that shoppers never agreed to

distributed to the members of the llc  defendants seek to avoid payment to power line by arguing that hermes calgonthg acquisition llc no longer has funds to pay power line  mr falsetti mr pettinato and others depleted the cash of hermes calgonthg acquisition llc which was the companys most significant and liquid asset  as a result of the depletion of its cash by mr falsetti and mr petinato hermes calgonthg acquisition llc became insolvent and was unable to pay power line  defendants purposely and systematically created the companys insolvency  despite acknowledging the obligation to pay power line defendants instead paid themselves  defendants claim that they have no obligation to pay power line because their relationship with power line was that of a joint venture  defendants did not have a joint venture with power line because in addition to mr falsettis email to sandy santucci at shoppers admitting that the goods were to be paid for by defendants and not contingent upon shoppers issuing a purchase order power line specifically revised the initial confidentiality agreement sent by mr pettinato to mr parker to remove all references to an investment or a joint partnership  in stating that he was good with the changes that power line made to the confidentiality agreement mr pettinato consented to the modification and he believed that mr parker appropriately modified the confidentiality agreement to reflect a vendor relationship and not an investment relationship  power line was therefore a vendor for defendants  other individuals and vendors were reimbursed for their costs and paid for their expenses including mr pettinato ms barry and vendors such as sharon ingarra graphic design and member simon browns company  the superior court of

develop formulas for the product line power line reasonably relied upon those misrepresentations  at trial several misrepresentations were identified a misrepresentations in defendants powerpoint

across the country  despite those representations defendants did not have a partnership with walgreens nor did defendants have any communications with walgreens to sell the product line  despite the representation that defendants had us based success mr pettinato admitted that solebury brands the company represented in the powerpoint presentation had had no success up to that point  defendants representation in the powerpoint presentation that the partnership with walgreens was scheduled to hit stores in august of this year was false and there never was a schedule to sell the product line to walgreens  after reviewing the representations power line reasonably believed that defendants had a partnership with walgreens that the defendants company had us based success and that the product line was scheduled to be sold in walgreens in august   defendants statement in the powerpoint presentation that shoppers drug mart first shipment is june of     was false as there never was a firm commitment from shoppers drug mart to sell the product line and hermes calgonthg acquisition llc and shoppers drug mart never had a written contract  after reviewing the representations regarding shoppers power line reasonably believed that defendants had an agreement to sell the product line to shoppers and that the first shipment would be in june   as a result of defendants representation in the powerpoint presentation that we anticipate no further capital needs beyond this funding as we are immediately profitable ms johanningsmeier reasonably believed that there was money to pay power line b misrepresentations in defendants official company info email  the official company info email that mr pettinato sent to power line which he wanted ms johanningsmeier to read and believe contained false information  the following information in the official company info was inaccurate a legal name of the company b dba of the company c federal id of the company and d business type of the company  although defendants were aware that the official company info email contained misinformation they did nothing to correct any of the information contained in the document or to advise power line of the inaccurate information c defendants intention to induce action by power line  on march  —the same day that ms santucci stated to ms barry i need you to review the strategy of the product line—mr pettinato sent an email to mr parker at power line that stated we need to place orders to tube guy asap to hit dates  mr parker reasonably believed that this email indicated that mr pettinato had a specific date in mind which required immediate action by power line to get the order done  mr pettinatos statement was false and he knew it was false because there were no dates in place that needed to be hit  mr parker reasonably relied upon that statement and placed orders for component parts for the product line  defendants never paid power line for those materials d power lines justifiable reliance  after reviewing the powerpoint ms johanningsmeier researched dana holdings llc—the name at the bottom of every page of the document—and learned that it was an investment company owned by mr falsetti  ms johanningsmeier also researched hermes llc—the name on the official company info email—and learned that it was an investment company that had assets valued at  million  after reviewing the documents provided by the defendants and performing her own research ms johanningsmeier was satisfied that defendants had the funds and finances to pay for the product line e misrepresentations are not aspirations  although defendants do not deny that false information was provided to power line they contend that the inaccurate information was an aspirational strategy of future state and a vision of the plan of the company in the future our vision of growth  the powerpoint presentation did not state or imply anywhere that it was an aspirational document or anything similar in nature  the powerpoint presentation and the official company info email were intentional misrepresentations by defendants that were made to power line in order to induce it to act  power line reasonably relied upon defendants misrepresentations to its detriment and suffered damages as a result of its purchase of materials and its development of the product line  defendants have used the company to attempt to avoid making payment to power line and are attempting to perpetrate fraud by asking the court to permit them to keep the money which was distributed to them rather than being used to pay power line d defendants are liable to power line under the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil  since hermes calgonthg acquisition llc was undercapitalized since it substantially intermingled its assets with that of mr falsetti since defendants failed to adhere to company formalities and since defendants used the company to perpetrate a fraud by paying insiders rather than pay its vendor power line defendants corporate veil should be pierced  defendants mr falsetti and mr pettinato who are either the principal equity holders directors or apparent individuals in control of hermes calgonthg acquisition llc are held individually liable to power line  although ms barry held the title of vice president of marketing for the solebury brands her title alone is not a sufficient basis to determine her liability see eg franklin cnty deputy sheriffs assn v pennsylvania labor relations bd  ad   pacmwlth  job titles or descriptions alone are inadequate to overcome the pennsylvania labor relations boards requirement that it make unit determinations based on actual job functions  ms barry was not an equity holder officer director or in control of hermes calgonthg acquisition llc and is therefore not individually liable to power line e defendants are liable to power line under the doctrine of fraudulent misrepresentation  the elements of fraudulent misrepresentation are  a misrepresentation  a fraudulent utterance thereof  an intention to induce action thereby  justifiable reliance thereon and  damages as a proximal result wilson v donegal mut

that reliance power line suffered damages due to the purchase manufacture and storage of materials and the development of formulas for the product line for which defendants have not paid f in the alternative power line reasonably relied upon defendants negligent misrepresentations  alternatively although defendants misrepresentations appear to be intentional defendants misrepresentations were at least negligent  the elements of negligent misrepresentation are  a misrepresentation of material fact  the representor knows of the misrepresentation or makes the misrepresentation without knowledge as to its truth or falsity or makes the representation under circumstances where the representor ought to know of its falsity  the representor intends the representation to induce action and  injury due to justifiable reliance upon the misrepresentation halper v jewish family  childrens serv  ad  pa   when mr falsetti drafted the powerpoint which mr pettinato and ms barry reviewed and when mr pettinato sent various emails containing inaccurate information to power line defendants knew or should have known that the representations were inaccurate  for example defendants knew or should have known that they did not have a contract to sell the product line to walgreens and shoppers that hermes calgonthg acquisition had no us based success that the company they were working on behalf of was not hermes llc and that there were no product shipment dates to hit  defendants made the misrepresentations in order to induce power line to proceed with the purchase of materials and develop the product line  power line reasonably and justifiably relied upon those misrepresentations to conclude that hermes calgonthg acquisition llc was a legitimate business that was able to pay
