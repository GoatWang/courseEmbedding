begin all of our relationships by going through the cambridge advisors personalized aim system  our comprehensive investment management process looks at each clients unique situation and develops a customized solution to help the client achieve their specific financial goals   step  step  step  assess and analyze first we assess and analyze the clients unique situation looking at factors such as time horizon tax bracket types of accounts resources and investment experience  we also discuss their  goals and needs for their accounts along with any preferences or limitations for the account  from the information gathererd we create and update the investment policy statement which provides guidelines on how the portfolio should be invested   implement next we develop and implement a customtailored investment plan  we do not use model stock portfolios or proprietary investment funds so each client has an investment portfolio unique to them that is dependent on factors in their investment policy statement as well as when they became a client  the investment plan may be implemented immediately or gradually over time depending on the client and their situation monitor and make adjustments then on an ongoing basis we monitor and make adjustments to the portfolio and the investment plan as needed  we meet with the client periodically to review progress and keep the plans current with life events such as career change retirement death of a spouse birth of children or grandchildren or even changes in risk tolerance  these events trigger the process to restart   investment committee our advisors form the investment committee and are actively involved in the research functions of the firm as well as the portfolio management functions we make our own investment decisions internally rather than rely on a buy list from a parent company or wall street third party  therefore our recommendations and investment decisions are free from conflicts of interest the investment committee meets three times a week to discuss the economy the markets and securities we currently own or are considering buying we gather information from a wide variety of sources for analysis and utilize state of the art research tools  all advisors thoroughly understand the fundamentals of the securities they are buying and selling in the client portfolios they are managing the advisor implements the recommendations of the investment committee as appropriate for each client   investment philosophy in an era when many investment managers seem intent on trying to create onesizefitsall investment strategies and products we have kept our focus on providing a high caliber of personalized investment management services  each client account is managed separately from other client accounts our portfolios are customized to each client so that we respect risk tolerance levels and return expectations when structuring portfolios we consider several factors  first we take into account the clients investment policy statement  second we strive to build a diversified portfolio  third based on current market conditions and our future outlook we emphasize areas where we see higher growth potential within this framework we build a portfolio that reflects each clients specific constraints including liquidity issues investment horizon government regulations tax implications and unique needs while we are not markettimers we do recognize that the riskreward relationship of the various asset classes will change over time  asset allocations are adjusted to reflect our outlook of future growth opportunities and risk levels as well as the clients needs  factors such as equity valuations and interest rate levels may influence asset allocations  when equity valuations andor interest rates are at historically high levels it may encourage a shift in asset allocation in favor of fixed income securities  when equity valuations andor interest rates are at historically low levels it may encourage a shift in favor of equity securities  most changes in asset allocation due to market factors are gradual    attentive      ♦      trusted      ♦
