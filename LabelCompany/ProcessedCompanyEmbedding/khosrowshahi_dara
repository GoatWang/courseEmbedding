expedia boss dara khosrowshahi on the new breed of disrupters dara khosrowshahi wants expedia to be a realtime travel service powered by voice assistants  matt lutton when dara khosrowshahi first heard of the company now called expedia it was the turn of the millennium and the height of the dotcom bubble he was working for iac the us media company and eyeing expedia because it was a big disrupter in the travel sector one industry after another was upended by digital technology some  years later the roles are reversed expedia now the biggest online travel agency in the us is at risk of being disrupted — and mr khosrowshahi’s job is to prevent that with the rise of the sharing economy and new threats from companies such as airbnb the way people travel is changing but mr khosrowshahi has been through difficult disruptions before “the years that i have been here have not all been smooth sailing” he says after he became chief executive in  expedia was hit by the financial crisis then had to invest heavily in technology to compete with other travel search engines “desperation sometimes drives innovation” he says reflecting on that period today expedia could hardly be accused of desperation — revenues were more than bn in the past  months up  per cent from the previous year the total number of rooms per night booked rose  per cent to reach m during the first quarter of the year but it is still trying to stay one step ahead of the disrupters mr khosrowshahi  has pursued that challenge with a combination of tech investment and acquisitions that reflect his background as a banker born in iran and raised in new york state he studied electrical engineering in college and cut his teeth in finance at allen  co the investment bank he joined barry diller’s iac a media conglomerate that bought a controlling stake in expedia from microsoft in  the move was a shift from banking “it was always finance first    for me the biggest change has been that it’s product and technology first now” he says mr khosrowshahi’s latest obsession is voice search and he has several types of voice assistants at home he imagines how one day voice search could replace the current system of ticking boxes and filling in airport codes on a website to book a plane ticket “you are going to get into a world where people are going to ask questions    and we will be able to answer any question about travel” he says with a glow passengers can only retrieve simple information such as checking an itinerary or booking a car from the expedia voice app on amazon’s alexa but in the long term his goals lie beyond voice search mr khosrowshahi wants expedia to become a sort of realtime travel assistant one that can call your uber ride to the airport at the right time have a car waiting when you land and choose your favourite room in a hotel this project is in its infancy but the bigger challenge is that other companies are working towards the same goals expedia also faces growing competition from some of the most wellknown companies in silicon valley priceline its main rival for online hotel bookings and owner of bookingcom and opentable is gathering data that allows it to offer users more personalised experiences a bigger threat could come from airbnb the homesharing company recently valued by investors at bn which is more than the enterprise value of expedia airbnb has ambitions to add car booking ticket purchasing and concierge services to its app mr khosrowshahi has tried an offensive two years ago he bought homeaway the us vacation rental company that includes vrbo a popular homesharing site homeaway’s business has grown rapidly with bookings up  per cent in the first quarter of this year but integrating homeaway’s room inventory with expedia has not been easy “this alternative lodging is where independent hotels were  years ago” mr khosrowshahi says “we spent the past  years wiring up all these independent hotels and we are just starting to do the same for alternative lodging” expedia owns a range of other brands including trivago orbitz travelocity kayak and egencia that supply it with large amounts of data about individual travel habits another “existential threat” as mr khosrowshahi puts it comes from google “they are a competitor for the consumers’ hearts and minds when they have a travel question” he says there is a twist to this rivalry because expedia is also one of google’s biggest customers expedia will spend about bn this year on marketing and much of that will be on google ads to draw travellers to expediaowned sites the white house is a wild card for expedia twothirds of the company’s business is in the us and the volatility of pronouncements from the trump administration have had a dampening effect on business for mr khosrowshahi who was born in tehran but holds us citizenship some of these decisions strike close to home such as the executive order in january that banned arrivals from seven muslimmajority countries the ban was subsequently suspended by the judiciary but the government’s legal battle continues “it is important to have safe borders but at the same time we can’t forget what brought us here this is an immigrant nation” he says “anytime you introduce volatility it is not good for business and not good for travel” expedia has weathered this kind of political turmoil before when iac acquired its majority stake in the company in  the deal was nearly called off because of the september  terrorist attacks iac chairman mr diller had the option to pull out under the “material adverse conditions” clause mr khosrowshahi recalls being in the room when the decision was made “barry looked up and said ‘you know what if there’s life there’s travel so it’s going to come back’    so we stayed in the business and thank god we did” second opinion the mentor barry diller chairman of iac says dara khosrowshahi has thrived on being challenged without necessarily having the background to deliver “i think he is first rate obviously” says mr diller “we gave him more responsibility than his experience dictated but we thought that he had the freshest best approach “and it is a real example of quality of leadership that expedia has grown throughout and is now in as good a position as it has probably ever been” expedia boss dara khosrowshahi on the

leslie d helm  from the print edition  june      as ceo of expedia dara khosrowshahi presides over the world’s largest online travel business with  billion in revenues in  and a growing treasure trove of popular travel sites including tripadvisor hotwire and hotelscom coming to america i came to the states with my family in  during the iranian revolution when i was  i thought all those channels on cable tv were really cool i didn’t notice that we moved from a mansion to a little condo we had the comfort of family and food on the table the us is a welcoming place for people who didn’t grow up here maintaining an iranian identity it was an ironic reversal when we were in iran my parents wanted us to go to college in the states so at the dinner table they insisted we speak english we hated it then in the states our parents insisted we speak farsi we would say “do we have to speak farsi nobody speaks farsi here” switching careers from engineering to investment banking i had a great engineering training program in kentucky lined up but my girlfriend lived in new york love won the day i joined allen and co an investment bank focused on media as head of strategy and planning it set me off on my career acquisitions i’ve done  transactions in the five years i’ve been running expedia i’ve learned three lessons first keep it simple when you need to put together a long argument to justify it then too many things have to go right to make it work and you will probably have a failure in real life things always go wrong second management has to be great our most spectacular home run deal was tripadvisor when we bought it  it was going to do  million in cash flow and last year it did close to  million steve kaufer the founder took it all the way to where it is now third go with your gut there have been a couple of deals where it seemed right intellectually but it didn’t feel right in my gut and i went forward with the deal and it was a disaster  the financial crisis all of us were pretty panicked the first thing the board asked us when the crisis hit was “is the company safe”  fortunately we’ve always been really conservative in terms of having enough cash to run the company once we could say the company was safe we had the luxury to act in a rational manner emerging from recession last year when business demand cratered hoteliers looked to leisure demand to take up the slack they put a lot of great deals out there last year was the best time for a leisure traveler to buy in probably the last  years consumers came to a lot of our sites and bought pretty aggressively people put off buying their cars but they didn’t put off going on vacation that allowed us to gain a lot of share on competition from google and microsoft last year we launched the “traveler first” initiative it is pretty simple if we are making a decision about a new product or a new acquisition always think about what it means to the traveler first then think about the profit and loss last year for example we cut booking fees to zero amid the worst recession we also got rid of changecancellation fees if we think about the traveler first if we up our game we can avoid any potential disintermediation travel is our lifeblood we should do it better than anyone else we have plenty of capital frankly we have no excuses social networking our social strategy is led by tripadvisor the site was founded on the basis of travelers telling each other unvarnished unedited opinions now we have cruisecriticcom where people discuss the food and entertainment on cruises the amount of information is incredible users tend to put out a review and you get viral adoption of products growth advertising is an exploding revenue stream it’s  percent of revenue and double that in profits we are by far the largest travel media company in the world we see incredible opportunities in the asiapacific region and latin america they are just getting started in internet commerce and travel is always a leading category eighty percent of leisure travel in asia used to happen over the holidays now people are beginning to take vacations on other days expedia’s  million rd budget we are a travel technology company it’s really about bringing together the travel skills and technology to make special things happen it’s the value we add to our consumers and it’s the value we add to our supply partners it will always be core to what we do challenges the unknown is in mobile with devices like the iphone and ipad people have been talking about the mobile revolution for  years and now it’s happening the danger is that whenever you have a new platform you have new businesses sprout up will there be another expedia that comes out of the mobile platform we would like that new company to be us but frankly it’s something i worry about there are people in the garage that have nothing to lose and everything to gain you have to watch very closely and if we don’t build it it’s something that we will have to buy recruitment it’s nice to be hiring again i recently had a conversation with an hr group about how many recruiters we should be bringing in seattle is a good area to be hiring in the only problem is transportation our bus system is pretty good but when you have a city this size you typically expect to have a better rail infrastructure events  awards jun   best

freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples
