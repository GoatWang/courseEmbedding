awarded the ab summa cum laude at barnard college in  and a phd in inorganic chemistry at columbia university in  in the laboratory of s j lippard after a postdoctoral fellowship at bell laboratories and yale university with r g shulman she became an assistant professor at hunter college city university of new york in  she returned to columbia university becoming an associate professor of chemistry and biological sciences in  and professor in  in the fall of  she joined the faculty at caltech from  to  she held the arthur and marion hanisch memorial professorship in  she began her term as chair of the division professor barton has pioneered the application of transition metal complexes to probe recognition and reactions of double helical dna she has designed chiral metal complexes that recognize nucleic acid sites with specificities rivaling dnabinding proteins these synthetic transition metal complexes have been useful in elucidating fundamental chemical principles that govern the recognition of nucleic acids in developing luminescent and photochemical reagents as new diagnostic tools and in laying a foundation for the design of novel chemotherapeutics barton has also carried out seminal studies to elucidate electron transfer chemistry mediated by the dna double helix she first showed that oxidative damage to dna can arise from a distance through charge migration through the dna duplex she furthermore established that dna charge transport chemistry is exquisitely sensitive to intervening perturbations in the dna base stack as with single base mismatches or lesions this chemistry has since been applied in the development of dnabased electrochemical sensors and explored in the context of long range signaling within the cell she has focused on the role of dna charge transport chemistry in dna repair through this research barton has trained more than  graduate students and postdoctoral students with about half in academic positions barton has received numerous awards these include the alan t waterman award of the national science foundation  the american chemical society acs award in pure chemistry  the acs eli lilly award in biological chemistry

career in chemistry the view from jacqueline k barton’s office at california institute of technology is modest despite the fact that it once belonged to twotime nobel laureate linus pauling and still showcases his analytical balance “i never thought i’d end up here” barton says as a girl born in  her early plans never involved becoming a chemistry professor at a place like caltech enlarge credit stephanie diani   credit stephanie diani even though it wasn’t the plan being a chemist is something at which barton has excelled—so much so that this year she is receiving the highest honor of the american chemical society the priestley medal “for brilliant work on electron transport in dna for dedication to training young investigators and for unwavering support of the chemistry enterprise” “she’s one heck of a creative scientist” says jonas c peters a chemistry professor at caltech “she started a field that has captivated a huge amount of interest and that bridges inorganic chemistry biochemistry and physical chemistry” “she is so incredibly enthusiastic and energetic” says erik holmlin who worked with barton for his phd and is now president and chief executive officer of bionano genomics “but she is also scientifically rigorous she has this combination of rigor and passion that really drives things forward and pushes back frontiers” barton is the third woman to receive the priestley medal the previous two were darleane c hoffman in  and mary l good in  barton first started pushing back frontiers as a child growing up in new york city where she attended riverdale country school at the time the school was gender segregated in addition to learning academic basics the girls studied art and music while the boys focused on advanced math and science the only coed class was american history but one of barton’s teachers saw that she was good at math and decided that she should take calculus “it was a major thing” barton says “she went to my parents and then she and my parents went to the headmistress” barton’s teacher prevailed and barton recalls being driven in a red station wagon to get to and from class on the boys’ campus barton’s father was a judge and her mother a homemaker “so the whole math and science thing was not part of their toolbox” barton says “but my parents were always proud of me” in  she entered barnard college the women’s college affiliated with columbia university barton thought she might major in math but chemistry won out “chemistry allows you to combine the rigors of mathematics with a little bit of something that could make a difference in the world” barton says also “i love the beautiful molecular structures” barton enrolled at columbia for graduate school where she initially thought that she’d focus on physical chemistry then chemistry professor stephen j lippard pitched a project to her that involved binding inorganic complexes to dna such that they would intercalate between the base pairs “i got excited about dna in the context of using it as a onedimensional lattice to load up small molecules” says barton noting that the project also involved some interesting statistical mechanics “she was a very bright very articulate very kind person” lippard says “she was clearly destined for a really great career” power couple barton and husband peter b dervan are the only married scientists who both have received the national medal of science in this nsf video they discuss their careers and research credit nsf after earning a phd barton spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher at bell laboratories then in  she returned to new york to join the chemistry faculty at hunter college “i wasn’t ambitious” barton says “when i was at riverdale i thought i’d be a high school teacher then i thought i’d be a college teacher i just sort of went from step to step” at hunter barton started her research program by investigating dnabinding metal complexes as analogs for restriction enzymes and other proteins that require metal ions to function she also learned how to teach write grants and interact with her colleagues after a couple of years at hunter however barton felt constrained she couldn’t do research at the level she wanted she says because of the teaching requirements and the graduate student pool in  lippard moved to massachusetts institute of technology and barton replaced him on the columbia faculty “she was really quite sensational” says ronald breslow one of barton’s columbia colleagues “she’s a brilliant person generally and she has huge amounts of energy and lots of enthusiasm she’s everything you’re looking for in a colleague “she has a winning personality” breslow continues “you can’t say that of all scientists—some succeed despite their personalities—but jackie has a wonderful warm personality and tremendous curiosity” enlarge mentor barton’s current group includes from left natalie muren elizabeth o’brien kelsey boyle alyson weidmann kathryn schaefer and adam boynton barton “can be the person to tell someone to pull up their bootstraps if needed but in a way that’s motivating rather than damaging” muren says credit stephanie diani   mentor barton’s current group includes from left natalie muren elizabeth o’brien kelsey boyle alyson weidmann kathryn schaefer and adam boynton barton “can be the person to tell someone to pull up their bootstraps if needed but in a way that’s motivating rather than damaging” muren says credit stephanie diani at columbia barton continued to work on dnabinding complexes exploring their enantioselectivity and sequence specificity she developed a particularly close relationship with colleague nicholas j turro who died in  “nick looked out for me” she says he helped her figure out how to run a growing group and optimize her grant funds turro and barton also collaborated scientifically using turro’s expertise in photochemistry to probe barton’s dna complexes that work led to a major finding by a joint postdoc c vijay kumar dna could transfer electrons between polypyridyl ruthenium and cobalt complexes j am chem soc  doi jaa science  doi science when the structure of dna was first solved chemists had proposed that the stacked aromatic bases might be a good electron transport medium but kumar barton and turro provided the first evidence for it when barton moved to caltech in  some members of her group continued to explore dna’s conductive properties in  postdoc catherine j murphy demonstrated that dna facilitated electron transfer along a base pair dna duplex—a distance of  å science  doi science in  megan e núñez extended that distance to  å chem biol  doi s but the idea that dna might behave as a molecular wire was controversial there was a lot of back and forth in the literature and harsh questions at conferences “she was given a tough time” lippard says barton prefers not to talk about it “it was painful” she concedes “and it was very tough on my students” barton approached the criticism headon with more experiments carefully controlled in particular she insisted that her group members work with dna under conditions normally found in a cell—in water at room temperature they also always used wellcharacterized dna so they knew how the base pairs stacked and how strongly electron donor and acceptor complexes coupled to the helices after many years “the bottom line is that we and others have learned that charge transfer through dna can occur over long molecular distances but it depends exquisitely on the stacking anything that screws up the stacking will screw up the electron transport” barton says if a thymineadenine step on the dna ladder is switched to a cytosineadenine or guanineadenine mismatch for example electron transfer will stop theorists are still trying to work out the mechanisms at play barton suggests that the debates were ultimately good for the field in doing all the experiments to satisfy the critics she says “we learned a lot more than we would’ve learned otherwise” enlarge scientist nichols medalists from left gilbert stork breslow peter dervan barton lippard and john roberts in  after cen ran this photo

jacobs received a letter from a reader who not realizing that the couple is married thought it was inappropriate for dervan to have his arm around barton “it gave me a great laugh” jacobs remembers credit william schulzcen alumni of her lab add that they also learned a few things about doing science “i can’t say i enjoyed it at the time—i think that we sent my first paper to  different journals before it was accepted” says shana kelley who got her phd from caltech and is now a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the university of toronto “but it taught me that you have to have a thick skin you have to do the experiments to understand what’s going on and you have to have the tenacity to stick with your ideas and not get discouraged” the fact that barton’s group members were able to come through the controversy with something positive to say is a testament to barton’s adept mentoring and ability to share her enthusiasm for science “as a mentor she was fabulous” says murphy who is now a chemistry professor at the university of illinois urbanachampaign “she was always sure it was going to work and we were going to figure out a way no matter what” “she has this amazing energy that she passes on to anyone who talks with her” says valérie c pierre who was a postdoc in barton’s lab and is now a chemistry professor at the university of minnesota twin cities “you would go into her office when nothing was working and come out encouraged to try the next experiment” barton sets high expectations kelley notes but at the same time “she really watches her people closely to see what they excel at and help them to hone their skills” kelley says “she taught me to be the very best scientist i could be” “the best part of what we do is help educate these young people and watch them turn into independent scientists” barton says “when they defend their thesis sitting there listening to them give their talk is just the most exciting thing in the world” enlarge colleague as

scientific research career isn’t for them barton remains supportive after getting her phd from caltech tashica williams amirgholizadeh went to law school and is now corporate counsel at gilead sciences barton “recognizes and appreciates that not everyone wants to follow the same path” amirgholizadeh says in addition to taking on scientific challenges and mentoring group members barton has contributed to the chemistry enterprise globally as a member of the dow chemical board of directors which she joined in  many board members are not scientists and “the board looks to her for thirdparty validation on things they’re hearing from management” says andrew n liveris dow’s ceo barton helps explain dow’s science to other board members—things such as why phosgene is a valuable synthetic building block—even as she pushes dow management to ensure that the company is doing the best it can technologically “what i hope and have to bring to the board is some calibration of how good dow’s rd operation is and where we stand on environment health and safety issues” barton says or as liveris puts it she helps the company with both offense and defense “i have deep admiration for her as a scientist leader and terrific person” he adds barton is also currently serving in her second consecutive term as chair of the caltech division of chemistry  chemical engineering caltech’s academic administration is lean she notes—there are only six division chairs the provost and the president—so division chairs have a great deal of influence “her strengths are her focus on critical problems and her energy in working on them—she doesn’t drop the ball” colleague harry b gray says “sometimes she has to make tough decisions that may be unpopular in some cases but she goes ahead” barton’s priorities have been fundraising and hiring fundraising has gone well—so far barton has raised  million to fund graduate fellowships as for hiring caltech has several chemistry faculty nearing retirement and the push is on to ensure that the division’s future is as bright as its past as part of that barton has created a diversity committee to try to figure out how the division can improve its recruiting “the twobody problem continues to be difficult” barton says but “i think the administration is increasingly committed to coming up with creative solutions” she adds barton’s colleagues note that she is just as good about mentoring young faculty as she is her group members she helps foster a supportive atmosphere that gives junior faculty confidence says caltech chemistry professor sarah e reisman barton has contributed to the chemistry enterprise through other service although she’s cautious and strategic about what she takes on “you can only have so many things on your plate” she says she manages her commitments by delegating “i love to hire people who are smart and competent and that i can trust” barton says her group members have their responsibilities maureen s renta her assistant of  years “does everything for the group that doesn’t have to do with science” barton says amy woodallojeda and other division staff handle whatever else doesn’t require barton’s direct attention and barton’s longtime nannyhousekeeper natividad loeza keeps things running at home these days barton’s group continues to work in three areas one is determining whether cells use dnafacilitated electron transfer as a means to monitor dna integrity another is exploiting dna electrochemistry for diagnostic applications such as distinguishing tumors from normal tissue by looking for highly methylated dna the third is designing metal complexes that bind at dna base pair mismatches for possible cancer treatments although barton’s group is smaller than it used to be—part of that is her chair responsibilities part is the overall funding climate—she seems no less enthusiastic about her science “it’s fun” she emphasizes “people who work for jackie see a brilliant scientist who is strategic and tough” says madeleine jacobs former acs executive director and ceo the combination of that jacobs says with barton’s compassion and generosity make her a truly

pictured the th hole of the old course approaches a road where people line up to watch the golfers coming in one time barton hit the ball over the green and into the rough beneath the spectators from there she chipped the ball right into the hole to make par “the audience erupted in applause” dervan recalls credit courtesy of jacqueline barton as jacqueline k barton was getting her career established in the early s there was another “young hotshot” as barton describes him also working on dna sequence recognition caltech chemistry professor peter b dervan “we were intellectual colleagues” barton says shying away from saying competitors the two scientists became familiar with each other at conferences with dervan approaching dna recognition from an organic chemistry perspective while barton exploited inorganic complexes barton also recalls that dervan reviewed one of her lab’s first papers she knew it was him because of the specific way that caltech printed materials “every line was redlined” she laughs although it was clear that he was trying to be helpful then the two got to know each other better while serving together for several years on the national science foundation advisory committee for chemistry in  barton and dervan married they remain devoted to each other “i really love this guy” barton says “i’m just the luckiest guy in the whole world” dervan says professionally barton and dervan have kept their research programs largely separate from each other’s generally avoiding collaboration they don’t serve on thesis committees for each other’s students although they will write recommendations if they’ve had someone as a teaching assistant they do however host joint group parties personally the couple also clearly distinguishes between professional and personal time on weekdays they typically arrive on campus around  am and go home at  pm and work stays at work they say they swim in their backyard pool—“i certainly have acclimated to california” says barton a new york city native—then barton makes dinner while dervan pours wine dervan has a son andrew from a previous marriage barton and dervan together have a daughter elizabeth when the children were young evenings and weekends were spent with them and the family vacationed together twice a year “i’ve always been impressed at how much jackie and peter emphasize family they’ve been a great example for me as a professor” says caltech chemistry professor jonas peters “jackie’s just a fantastic mom and i really respect her for what a good parent she is” now andrew is a physician with his own family and elizabeth is in law school still barton and dervan keep work out of their personal time the separate spheres mean that when barton and dervan attend conferences together and see each other’s talks they are often learning something for the first time “he’ll ask me a question or i’ll ask him and everyone thinks it’s a setup” barton says “it’s not it’s a genuine question”   a career in chemistry   chemical  engineering news issn  copyright  american chemical society     leave a comment comments by firsttime contributors will be reviewed

signaling within a cell by earthsky in human world  april   dr barton received a national medal of science after learning that cells use the double strands of the dna helix like a wire for longrange signaling a professor of chemistry at the california institute of technology jacqueline barton received a national medal of science in  for her discovery that cells use the double strands of the dna helix like a wire for longrange signaling among proteins within a cell her research holds promise for understanding how cells detect and repair dna defects – related both to ordinary conditions like aging – and to diseases like alzheimer’s and cancer this podcast is part of the thanks to chemistry series produced in cooperation with the chemical heritage foundation generous sponsorship support was provided by the basf corporation additional production support was provided by the camille and henry dreyfus foundation dupont and exxonmobil jacqueline barton spoke to earthsky’s jorge salazar on october   you received a national medal of science for discovering that dna acts like a wire in a cell tell us about that first of all it was an extraordinary honor i represent all the people who work with me – the graduate students and postdocs who really carry out the work we think about dna usually as the library of the cell it encodes all the information that makes us what we are national medal of science winner jacqueline barton via la times but it also turns out that when you look at the chemical or molecular structure of dna – that spiral staircase we call the double helix – you find the steps of the spiral staircase stacked one on top of one another it turns out that the dna double helix looks a lot like solid state materials that are quite conductive very soon after watson and crick first described the structure of dna chemists started asking – does this structure have the characteristic of being conductive that was over  years ago about  to  years ago chemists began being able to synthesize a little piece of dna – to know exactly what’s connected to what we attached little molecular probes to either side of the dna double helix to ask whether or not you can shoot an electron from one side of the dna to the other side of the dna and that’s how it all started then what happened at first we thought about dna in terms of its chemical characteristics we found that electrons and “holes” could move through dna we usually think about dna as “the library” because dna encodes the rna the rna is sort of like taking a xerox copy of what’s in the library then from the rna you go through the ribosome machine and you make proteins the proteins that are made are encoded by the sequence of base pairs in dna the nuclei of all our cells are filled with three billion base pairs of information in the dna but some of our cells have to become say a nose cell those cells have to make certain proteins get expressed others of our cells have to make other proteins get expressed and all that information is in the dna library dna double helix what happens let’s say when a cell is under stress it has to activate a response to that stress we’ve been finding that actually the information has to get coordinated across the dna library because a lot of things have to happen a lot of proteins have to get made we thought maybe there’s signaling across the nucleus of the cell – across the dnacontaining genome some of that might actually be happening by using dna as a wire what do you mean by that how can dna be like a wire your dna is getting damaged all the time especially if you don’t say eat your broccoli when the dna gets damaged that damage has to get fixed or else that information in the dna library can’t be used anymore in each of our cells we have this exquisite repair machinery little proteins are constantly sifting through your dna to find mistakes and fix them we found out that dna can be a good wire but it’s only a good wire if all the bases are stacked on top of each other – these steps on the spiral staircase – and if the dna isn’t damaged if there is a little mistake in the dna then it’s not a good wire anymore it’s like a stack of copper pennies and that stack of copper pennies can be conductive but if one of the pennies is a little bit awry – if it’s not stacked so well – then you’re not going to be able to get good conductivity in it the same is true in the dna double helix let’s go back to thinking about our dna becoming damaged all the time – how those repair proteins have to find those mistakes in the three billion bases of dna we think that what happens is that nature uses dna like a wire it’s sort of like two telephone repairmen trying to find a mistake in the line if they can talk to each other if these repair proteins can talk to each other across the dna then the dna is just fine so they don’t have to repair that region and they can go someplace else but if there’s a mistake in the dna then they can’t talk to each other so well from starting out over  years ago in synthesizing little pieces of dna – and seeing if we can shoot an electron up or down it – we’ve come now to the point of saying nature uses dna like a wire for longrange signaling and for finding mistakes in the dna what inspired you to become a chemist i like being in the lab when i was in high school i took a lot of math courses when i went to college i thought i’d try a chemistry course the lab part of the class was really exciting it got me hooked and it gave me a way to combine my mathematical perspective with thinking about realworld problems at the beginning it’s detective work – having a puzzle a problem to solve doing a reaction in the lab and seeing things change colors and then isolating a product and finding out what it was that was exciting as i got more and more into it i started getting involved in research then there are all sorts of interesting things to think about you’re learning things

with its job of carrying genetic information barton is hoping to find answers to this question barton has also shown that certain damaged dna molecules do not conduct electricity since damaged dna can cause many kinds of cancer she hopes that her discovery will eventually help doctors detect damaged dna before cancer results in addition barton has investigated how some metal compounds called “complexes” interact with dna molecules evidence suggests that metal complexes can be used to repair damaged dna recognition among her many honors barton received the national medal of science in

provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase deleted triples freebasewikidata mappings license citing freebase triples

httprdffreebasecomnsmeasurementunitdatedpercentage  if youre writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
