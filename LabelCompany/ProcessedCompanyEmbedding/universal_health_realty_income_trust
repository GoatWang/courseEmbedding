financial measures universal health realty income trust a real estate investment trust invests in healthcare and human service related facilities including acute care hospitals rehabilitation hospitals subacute care facilities medicaloffice buildings freestanding emergency departments and childcare centers we have investments in sixtyseven properties located in twenty states this press release contains forwardlooking statements based on current management expectations numerous factors including those disclosed herein those related to healthcare and healthcare real estate industry trends and those detailed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission as set forth in item a  risk factors and in item forwardlooking statements and risk factors in our form k for the year ended december   and in item  – forwardlooking statements and certain risk factors in our form q for the quarterly period ended march   may cause the results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our capability to control or predict these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and therefore actual results may differ materially readers should not place undue reliance on such forwardlooking statements which reflect managements view only as of the date hereof we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statements or to make any other forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share as reflected on the attached supplemental schedules which are nongaap financial measures gaap is generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america are helpful to our investors as measures of our operating performance in addition we believe that when applicable comparing and discussing our financial results based on these measures as calculated is helpful to our investors since it neutralizes the effect in each year of material items that are nonrecurring or nonoperational in nature including items such as but not limited to gains on transactions funds from operations ffo is a widely recognized measure of performance for real estate investment trusts reits we believe that ffo and ffo per diluted share which are nongaap financial measures are helpful to our investors as measures of our operating performance we compute ffo as reflected on the attached supplemental schedules in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition or that interpret the nareit definition differently than we interpret the definition  ffo adjusts for the effects of gains such as gains on transactions that occurred during the periods presented ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap in addition ffo should not be used as i an indication of our financial performance determined in accordance with gaap ii an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap iii a measure of our liquidity or iv an indicator of funds available for our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders a reconciliation of our reported net income to ffo is reflected on the supplemental schedules included below to obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance these measures should be examined in connection with net income determined in accordance with gaap as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this report or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission including our report on form k for the year ended december   and our report on form q for the quarterly period ended march   since the items included or excluded from these measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance under gaap these measures should not be considered to be alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or profitability since these measures as presented are not determined in accordance with gaap and are thus susceptible to varying calculations they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies investors are encouraged to use gaap measures when evaluating our financial performance more universal health realty income trust consolidated
