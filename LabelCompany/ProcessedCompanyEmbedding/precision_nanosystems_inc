delivery vehiclelipid nanoparticles lnps are well suited as delivery vehicles in gene therapy via nucleic acid delivery to primary cells modulating genes has become common practice in disease research both for understanding and treating genetic ailments in research modulating the expression of genes can help identify the proteins involved in a disease as a treatment delivering a nucleic acid to suppress protein expression or replace a diseasecausing protein can reverse the disorder the low toxicity and low immunogenicity make lnps unique alternatives to viral and cationic gene delivery systemsthe main obstacle to nucleic acid delivery is that the therapeutic genetic material becomes degraded once injected or applied systemically to an organism furthermore nucleic acids are large molecular constructs that cannot be easily endocytosed or passively absorbed by cells to overcome these challenges lnps have been developed to encapsulate and protect nucleic acids at high encapsulation efficiency also  lnps are broadly applicable because they are taken up through a nearlyubiquitous endogenous pathway their low toxicity allows them to be used with challenging cell types
