summaryekso insider adam gottbetter jailed for fraud while other ekso individuals face further allegations secs foia shows ekso facing or faced law enforcement investigation where is eksos disclosure on thisboston dynamics states nothing to do with ekso and any work together completed months ago lockhead states fortis not an ekso product and independently designed by lmt and robradypreviously presented ekso “charter clinics” now supporting competing products and stating competitor products are superior industry shift towards rentallease leaves undercapitalized ekso in an impossible situationhuge global companies now competing with ekso and demonstrably superior and cheaper products eksos founder left the company and founded competing company with  the price and  the weightaccelerating cash burn product failure and eksos financial architect jailed for fraud as insiders register to sell stock with paid stock promotion make x sales and m valuation clearly unsustainablei believe ekso is an offensive reversemerger where insider and eksos financial architect responsible for temporarily dodging a  ekso bankruptcy was recently jailed for fraud furthermore a sec foia response received shows ekso is facing or faced a law enforcement investigation i am shocked to find no ekso disclosure which leaves investors in the dark about the extent of any potential issues or what is going on pic credit ekso industry research also shows ekso is now nothing more than a hype machine with no hope of commercial success multiple large global juggernauts have apparently displaced ekso at many of the companys past charter clinics as previous partners now tout competitors products as superior an analysis of all ekso employees on linkedin show the company imploding internally as key employees depart enmasse despite having just  fulltime employees in the past few years ekso has churned through  employees with  of them not even lasting past  year successful businesses about to rapidly grow sales do not have this kind of attrition leading me to believe eksos sales ramp is impossible with less than m of revenue and m per year cash burn ekso will run out of cash again in early  eksos ceo nathan harding presided over nearbankruptcy in  and was forced to stop paying approximately half of ekso employees the only meaningful capital the company has been able to raise was done with partners now jailed for fraud or charged with other violations with those sketchy partners unavailable when eksos cash runs out in  months i expect the companys bankruptcy is likely given everything above eksos current m valuation or x revenue is clearly absurd and i believe is only temporarily possible due to eksos  unsophisticated retail shareholder base and eksos paid stock promotion supporting this view ekso insiders have registered to sell stock i applaud any medical patients finding any relief from any offering anywhere but from an investor and financial standpoint ekso is an obvious disaster that is imploding as we speak generously valuing ekso similar to peers shows imminent  downside with more likely outcome of bankruptcy and total investor wipeout similar to other adam gottbetter deals and stocks using paid stock promotion more below ekso insider and financial architect adam gottbetter jailed for fraud ironically named adam gottbetter is the financial architect and creator of ekso through the reverse merger and financing which temporarily helped ekso avoid bankruptcy in  when ekso ran out of cash and was forced to stop paying  of its workforce adam gottbetter was an ekso insider as we can see where he is listed as ekso contact person for this  ekso sec filing i believe that without gottbetter ekso would have clearly gone bankrupt in  when ekso basically ran out of money and had to pause the company for nearly a year unfortunately for ekso shareholders adam gottbetter recently pleads guilty to fraud and is serving time in jail according to thedealcom investment bank gottbetter capital markets llc arranged at least  pipes from  through may  raising  million for companies including ekso bionics holdings inc……the sec action against gottbetter included allegations that he and others manipulated shares… adam gottbetter not smiling anymore… picture credit thedeal you can find the secs press release here the three rehearsed stories they would tell if ever questioned by law enforcement during one meeting in new york city gottbetter complained about the difficulties of stock manipulation but conceded that robbing a bank was the only other way to make so much money so quickly offensively adam seems to have used his gains to finance a lavish lifestyle including a  million manhattan penthouse complete with separate m living quarters for his maid gottbetters playbook was simple acting as attorney he helped lowquality companies with no hope of future success like ekso seems to be go public via reversemerger his firm gottbetter capital markets provided necessary cash where gottbetter would get a piece of the action so he could after promotional campaigns kicked in dump his stock on the market before it collapses worthlessly in an embarrassingly bad interview with disgraced stock tout tobin smith gottbetter took the opportunity to promote gran tierra energy nysemktgte as one of the most successful deals he was ever involved in gran tierra was later exposed by barrons as a hard glossymailer stock promotion campaign in which gottbetter participated another attorney in the gran tierra scandal was charged by the sec for securities fraud and it appears gottbetter regularly partnered with individuals charged with penny stock manipulation one of the broker dealers named alongside gottbetter in the ekso form d is edi financial which was recently censored by finra for allegedly making inappropriate private placement investments while dinosaur securities llc also participated with gottbetter and has also had many alleged disciplinary problems with finra this  s filing shows ekso insiders associated with gottbetter registered to sell an estimated  shares while on the other side of the trade unsurprisingly we find  of ekso shares are held by unsophisticated retail investors does this seem fair to you i believe it is obvious that ekso management must know what is going on as the companys ceo nathan harding cosigned sec documents with adam gottbetter while even a basic google search shows numerous concerning allegations against gottbetter and associates going back to at least  why did nathan harding and ekso willingly choose to partner with gottbetter when they should have knewbetter are these the kind of people you should trust or give your hardearned money to to decipher a pattern for ekso lets look at other gottbetter deals boldface group otcpkblbk charys holding corporation hbp energy otcpkhbpe kentucky usa energy otckyus lifeapps digital media otcpklfap mesa energy holdings nevada gold holdings rackwise otcpkrack all charts from capiq ekso also partnered with opaleyes james silverman who faced insider trading charges shockingly its not just gottbetter as james silvermans opaleye management is eksos second largest shareholder and has recently been attempting to sell ekso stock opaleye previously known as risk reward capital was apparently pursued for insider trading by the secretary of the state of massachusetts who accused silverman of using an expert network to obtain inside information in a quest to improve dismal returns editupdate i am told silverman and massachusettes settled their differences in an outofcourt settlement sec filings show silverman owns m shares of ekso through opaleye and silverman insurance partnership making him one of eksos largest shareholders in a march   securities registration silverman is listed as attempting to sell at least   shares of ekso stock which silvermanopaleye acquired in january  directly with gottbetter from capitaliq ekso bionics holdings inc announced a private placement on best efforts basis of  units at  per unit for gross proceeds of  on january   each unit consists of one common share and one share purchase warrant each warrant is exercisable at  per share for a period of five years the transaction included participation from opaleye lp a fund managed by opaleye management inc montrose capital group llc and other investors gottbetter capital markets llc acted as the exclusive placement agent for the best efforts transaction and edi financial inc acted as a subagent interestingly within months of gottbetters ekso reverse merger both silverman and gottbetter filed to sell a large amount of stock in  curiously just prior to this ekso stock mysteriously rallied dramatically for no apparent reason given charges of market manipulation to people associated with ekso you can make your own speculations how and why that happened regardless we know one thing with certainty ekso insiders were in a hurry to sell stock as ekso worked with the sec in an attempted acceleration of its registration effective date ekso bionics holdings inc hereby requests that the securities and exchange commission accelerate the effective date of the abovereferenced registration statement eksos questionable insiders clearly missed that very brief window when ekso stock rallied as the original offering appears to have failed tellingly though see below insiders have once again filed to sell stock at a much lower price while ekso stock has more than doubled off the bottom again for no apparent reason unsurprisingly silverman and gottbetter affiliates have again filed to sell a large amount of ekso stock in a march  registration affiliates of gottbetter also registered to sell stock in this filing although its unclear what will happen to gottbetters ekso stock now that hes in jail will it be dumped onto the market if ekso was such an amazing opportunity why would insiders register to sell stock at  or lower secs foia response ekso subject of an ongoing law enforcement investigation given what we have seen above i find this sec foia response received last year to be concerning we know foia a exemptions are used during active law enforcement investigations we also know from the gottbetter trial that he received a lighter trial by supplying additional information about his associates so we dont know how deep that investigation is or who it may be targeting since ekso has not disclosed any information about this i dont know what is going on exactly but with eksos financial architect in jail sharing information with federal authorities along with all the other ekso issues explained below i am very concerned the ekso hype machine partnerships overblown and paid stock promotion consistent with the gottbetter playbook ekso claims vague partnerships with random companies and uses paid stock promotion by the dubious offshore firm edison whose reports appear dressed up to look like real wall street research but fine print clarifies seem to just be paid stock promotion credit edison research in this light i find interesting eksos management consistently fails to disclose the amount or extent of any partnership it gets while playing fast and loose with the facts for example ekso touts incessantly hype a boston dynamics relationship which curiously had zero quotes from boston dynamics itself in the press release it seems this partnership was so important that it didnt even merit a single public statement by boston dynamics further research to boston dynamics resulted in the response we have nothing to do with that company with an abrupt end to the conversation a second email from boston dynamics confirmed any relationship that ever existed ended months ago ekso touts also repeatedly promote past work with lockheed martin nyselmt but a call to lmt confirmed fortis is not an ekso product and fortis was independently developed by lockheed martin with support from robrady design further research with robrady design also turns up zero mention of ekso but instead states it was a lockheed martin project which was apparently gone through from the ground up what is really going on here until lockheed martin comes out with a public press release clarifying this i dont think any of us know what reality is not that it even matters though as eksos sec filings state after  lmt will have exclusive rights to the military market anyway cutting ekso off regardless while there is no hope of ekso competing against a globally dominant manufacturing company like lmt in any capacity no wonder insiders want to cash out who could blame them lastly on the q call investors asked ekso management for any color at all on the latest claimed agreement with ottobock unsurprisingly ekso management refused to provide any color on the extent financial terms or really anything at all and simply passed over the question instead responding with vague and useless validation hype ekso has also repeatedly fed investors false promises about its own future and repeatedly missed its own goals for instance after originally saying ekso would have a home use personal product done by  in this article ekso stated in  it would have a personal mobility device by  then in this later article ekso also stated again and again it would have a personal ekso in the market in  despite all this hype about ekso entering the home market in ekso sec filings where the consequences of deception are much higher ekso states its exploration of this potential market is in the very early stages i believe this is likely because in the rewalk nasdaqrwlk fda disclosures we can see that a consistent speed for m of  meters per second a function of necessary time to cross a street as apparently critical unfortunately the ekso suit is just too weak and clumsy to ever achieve this speed hurdle by the comfortable margin it seems is necessary for fda approval effectively making fda clearance for the home market an impossibility for eksos suit the only financial details i can find on ekso partnerships are that ekso has generated just m in total licensing revenue since inception which is immaterial for a m valued company we also know if one customer is  of revenue all public companies are required by the sec to disclose that so if ekso announces a partnership without mention of financial terms and it is not disclosed in detail in sec filings you can know that it may be anywhere between  of revenue to  of revenue which given eksos tiny total revenue is telling ekso technology already failing with superior products and global juggernauts entering the market claims ekso has superior technology are not grounded in reality and are likely spread by individuals who have not done extensive work talking to people who actually use products in the market not only is ekso years behind the curve but now that a few small companies have been first man over the wall large global juggernauts with superior rd teams and endless cash are entering the market with superior products even more concerning ekso is attempting to spread its tiny rd budget across multiple end markets making success against larger and more focused competitors impossible obviously if ekso were such a promising company it would not have partnered with jailed fraudster or almost gone bankrupt in  or forced into a sketchy last resort reverse merger with a strange penny stock shell any company from google nasdaqgoog nasdaqgoogl to lmt could have bought ekso for pennies at that point and tellingly they chose not to i think ekso was already behind the technology curve back in  due to financial stress once ekso was forced to effectively put the company on pause for nearly a year and stop paying employees ekso effectively died forever at that point and in this hyper competitive industry against better funded global competitors crushed any hope of future success with this in mind you should not find my following chart comparing the available exoskeleton products surprising this estimated chart was painstakingly built by talking to multiple people in the industry and digging through countless presentations and is unsurprisingly not something you see in eksos paid analyst reports chart built by me with best effort using publicly available information anyone who wants evidence ekso is clearly inferior technology see this video and note the lack of assistance for the gentleman on the left note the speed of walking for rwlk product on the left the natural gait and clearly superior technology superior rwlk product on the left pic credit youtube i applaud anyone walking in these suits but clearly rwlk technology is light years ahead of eksos crude offering we can see here rwlk technology has been capable of going up and down stairs since at least  and is the only suit approved for home use having been fda approved almost a year ago now this rwlk technology superiority is also why rwlk was used by this inspirational patient to complete the london marathon as far back as  pic credit rewalk not only that but rwlks product list price is k as far back as  i dont need to remind you this is nearly half of the price ekso quotes for their device while rwlks device has k different combinations of personal adjustments making it far better suited for individual ownership rwlk is clearly the leader in home use at the moment as its motors are the strongest and the fastest walking speeds are clocked in this suit furthermore rwlk uses samina for outsourced manufacturing which will allow it to scale while ekso is trying to build its suits itself in an old warehouse most importantly parker hannifins nyseph superior indego product is coming to market in a matter of months and proves to be both vastly superior and years ahead of anything else available the lightweight modular design and financing options will allow it to sweep the home market while the balance sheet of parker hannifin and integrated fes therapy will allow it to revolutionize the rehab market indego also had variable assist way back in  and rwlk has had partial assistance for a long time as well but ekso didnt announce this until  with an egregious k cost for example we can see below the indego is thin enough to wear in a wheelchair game pic credit indego indego also has no big bulky backpack to get in the way like the ekso suit has pic credit indego indegos fes functionality is even more revolutionary for the rehab market as clare hartigan mpt at shepherd center elaborates indego incorporating fes into gait is a huge advantage its not just rewalk and indego though as there are literally dozens of companies out in front of ekso with superior products approved around the globe from cyberdynes hal to many others cyberdyne products have been tested in  rehab centers in japan and are in use both in germany and the us already cyberdyne has sold over  units and is just getting started where even the prototype was used to carry a paraplegic friend near the top of swiss mountain breithorn while ekso is controlled by buttons osurus literally has skin implants that read your brain through your skin and nerve endings cyberdyne best hair and technology in exobionics no question meanwhile honda nysehmc is already leasing  of its walking assistance exoskeletons in japan since  with worker assistance devices in testing as well and devices already in trials in chicago i could go on and on but you get the picture the only positive thing i could find about ekso was that due to its crude design and limited adjustments in a rehab clinic setting it is easy to get new patients into the suit fast because the adjustments are limited and simple literally everything else is inferior from what i heard and can deduce once rwlk rolls out variable assist and indego rolls out with fes and other superior features and a better sales team there will be no reason for anyone to buy an ekso suit lastly spinal cord injuries are already being cured with stem cells and that technology will relentlessly improve in coming years owning ekso is in some ways a bet against stem cells and biotech innovation which is not a bet any smart investor should make pic credit google if you still honestly think ekso is a technology leader just look at what honda asimo demo here and boston dynamics amazing atlas humanoid robot are capable of then watch eksos old unimpressive technology and you will see why no company acquired ekso back in  before it imploded the first time previous ekso charter clinics now support competitors with superior products as further evidence of ekso failure we see clinics ekso previously stated were key partners now endorsing competing products as superior ekso previously hyped on past quarterly calls its top charter centers as key industry supporters selecting who they felt where the most important centers to work with to be supporters and champions for ekso pic credit ekso unfortunately for ekso the majority of these centers are now endorsing competitor products craig hospital co for example was the clinic to take first delivery of the first ekso gt suit and was working with berkeley bionics and ekso since at least  but is now a listed partner for parker hannifin with indego pic credit ekso with my highlights we see indego partners here while mount sinai center uses rwlk for patients as does spaulding rehab and tirr memorial furthermore rwlks multiyear head start means rwlk is in  of the top  clinics in the us already pic credit shepherd shepherd center is widely regarded as the single best rehab center in america it is one of few centers to have used all three available exoskeletons and tellingly it is apparently endorsing indego the parker hannifin product as the best product available pardon the long quote but this is an absolutely critical read shepherd center has a worldclass reputation in the field of rehabilitation and we are proud they have chosen to support us in the commercialization of indego said craig maxwell vice president of technology and innovation for parker shepherd center is the only rehabilitation facility to have tested indego and the two other devices currently being marketed by other companies as exoskeletons we see distinct advantages in indego including its lightweight and modular design that promotes independence said gary r ulicny phd president and ceo of shepherd center from a rehabilitation perspective we applaud indegos ability to vary the degree of robotic assistance and the use of electrical stimulation based on the users level of function the center has concluded that indego has the most promise as a device for both rehabilitation and home use indego is the only robotic exoskeleton that can be worn by a person while in his or her own wheelchair as well as in a vehicle or even a restaurant booth said clare hartigan a physical therapist at shepherd center who leads the clinical research the device can be used for mobility on all surfaces including stairs we are impressed with how easy indego is for people to use as well as its potential to provide compensatory gait for those with motor complete injuries in addition to its rehabilitative potential for those who are motor incomplete hartigan said the level of independence indego offers is unprecedented the most shocking aspect of all of this is that the paker hannifin indego product hasnt even been formally released to the market fully yet it is hitting europe this summer and should be for sale in us shortly after as this marketing effort and financing or rental terms become formalized this momentum is only expected to increase and will be devastating for ekso has inferior technology and who does not have the cash flow necessary to support a rentallease program ekso industrial push thinly veiled desperation and failure i believe it is clear eksos pending failure in the rehab market and irrelevance in the personalhome market are why ekso is now desperately touting the industrial market unfortunately here ekso is also irrelevant and years behind the curve while competing with impossibly sophisticated and capitalized global manufacturing juggernauts in this space it seems we are now seeing products from panasonic boeing nyseba raytheon nysertn honda daewoo and cyberdyne among many others entering the ablebodied markets ekso has zero hope of success against companies like this panasonics powerloader for example will be sold at k and take  seconds to put on raytheon just spun out sarcos which just got jump started with serious board members and vc backing with obviously superior products here here and here while the military has stated it is now building its own purpose build navy device anyway this whole shift is behind the curve in my view anyway as helping people hold heavy grinders misses the true megatrend of robotic manufacturing replacing humans entirely note that ekso didnt announce its own passive exoskeleton for construction until  if the previously touted lmt relationship was going so well why would ekso do this why would ekso now try to compete with its own partners do you honestly believe tiny underfunded ekso can outmanufacture honda panasonic boeing and daewoo if i need to expand on this later i can but this will obviously never be a viable business for ekso and in my view is clearly a desperate attempt to have something it can hype to keep the stock from continuing its collapse as i look into my time machine i can predict how it seems the disastrous  ekso movie will play out i expect into q and especially q eksos business will start to nose over bad and failure will be impossible to ignore at that point as cash burn accelerates and ekso becomes increasingly desperate i believe we need to be wary of increasingly promotional and worthless press releases about vague partnerships and even tiny amounts of unprofitable commercial end market revenue we know ekso will require cash to survive sometime in q  which means it will likely attempt to raise cash in q  since ekso failed at this last time i think it will fail again ekso previous go to market strategy failed and ekso facing impossible market dynamics even worse there are tectonic shifts occurring right now in the exo skeleton market unrelated to technology which will destroy ekso tellingly this last quarter we saw ekso announce it is shifting its sales strategy towards renting suits what ekso investors are missing is this dynamic creates insurmountable balance sheet and cash flow issues for ekso while also demonstrating customers dont see the value proposition that justifies an outright purchase the key issue is if a clinic rents or leases a suit ekso is forced to pay cash for the suit up front and hold it in inventory or as an asset each one of these suits costs ekso at least k of cash up front and as eksos operating cash burn is also set to accelerate will pull forward eksos inevitable demise and cash requirement this working capital dynamic is absolutely critical as i estimate every  suits ekso tries to rent or lease will require m of cash use off its balance sheet in addition to m per month operating cash burn furthermore no off balance sheet debt financing partner will finance this eksos suits are rapidly changing and its future value is impossible to ascertain furthermore without ekso support and maintenance which would disappear in bankruptcy those suits are essentially worthless while ekso lack of earnings or cash flow certainly cannot support any level of debt this is a key advantage parker hannifin has which is parker hannifin can finance suits off its own balance sheet nearly for free with the b cash parker has on hand furthermore rwlk is a much more focused company with m in cash nearly twice the cash balance of ekso this means ekso is the financially weakest player in the market who is too underfunded to compete and left in an untenable position that cannot be sustained especially as increased industry competition begins to compress pricing and drive revenueasp declines all of this ignores the fact ekso is trying to simultaneously work on the very different military commercial rehab and individualhome markets all simultaneously this is also clearly impossible and spreading a very small and vulnerable company far too thin given poor management quality at ekso i dont find this surprising and given eksos previous go to market strategy seems to have failed i sense a repeating pattern set to occur ekso creator left started a competitor with superior products undisputed robotics genius professor kazerooni was the original founder of ekso and the one who seems responsible for its technology he left ekso and seems to have founded a competing exoskeleton company called us bionics which has a product coming to market priced at just k while looking very effective lightweight and thin enough to be worn in a wheelchair which japanese manufacturers apparently already want pic credit us bionics just to remind you kazerooni was the godfather of ekso and i believe the one responsible for essentially all of eksos foundational technology with over  patents to his name personally he built the berkley bionics lab from the ground up and put together the team there so very telling i believe that his out and gunning for ekso now if i was going to invest in anything in this space i would invest in us bionics and genius kazerooni who along with rewalk and vanderbuilt are the only people in exobionics with a track record of success the people left in charge of ekso are a mere shadow of the original team and if ekso was such an amazing opportunity with an atmosphere of innovation why didnt kazerooni stay and develop his products inside ekso ekso imploding internally employees flee enmasse as cash burn accelerates management of companies burning through tens of millions of dollars and on the edge of insolvency often blather unrealistic hype what they often dont discuss is reality i believe eksos own employees show us that ekso is imploding internally despite only  full time employees i estimate that ekso has churned through nearly  employees in just the past few years of these employees we can see the average tenure is estimated at just  years chart created by me with public linkedin profile info key positions across all ekso departments including head of sales marketing engineering and operations have all experienced shocking levels of turnover with key people leaving in droves i dont see how a company in such turmoil could possibly be a successful happy work environment driving innovation or effective sales strategies eksos former vp of marketing and coo recently both departed for competitor lim innovations while glenn davis a highly qualified senior executive from siemens left ekso in less than a year how can you have a marketing ramp if the vice president of marketing vice president americas coo and director of emea all recently left as the company experiences staggering turn over ekso has had three ceos just since  as well from bruce borup to eythor bender and now nathan harding who has the least management experience of any of them and presided over partnerships with convicted fraudster gottbetter as well as coming within an inch of bankruptcy i have less than zero faith in his competence and assume that is why ekso previously had outside ceos it should be clear to others as well in march of  ekso claimed it was at a key point of growth even though it furloughed nearly  of its workforce in  and then showed virtually flat revenue growth throughout  at less than  million of sales also concerning ekso has told investors in its k filing it plans to hire  more employees in the next few months but if you look at the careers section of the ekso website you will find zero sales positions listed and the page hasnt been updated properly in awhile furthermore eksos current manufacturing capacity is tiny at best and i see no production positions being hired for either i estimate eksos current plant and employee annual manufacturing capacity at just a handful of units per year anyway and best i can tell ekso has never clarified exactly what its current plant and staff annual manufacturing capacity anyway ekso management have dodged this question anytime it has been raised which is a huge red flag in my view and if i were them i would do what superior peer company rwlk did and fire the entire manufacturing team and outsource production immediately ekso conflicted wall street analyst models are mathematically impossible as weve seen with unis neon arna keyw iwsy and countless cashburning worthless disasters the lowest quality wall street banks are often blinded by the greed of banking fees this typically results in what investors call a sell side promotion where impossible estimates are put forth by bottom tier wall street banks in a fight to see who can be most bullish to curry favor from garbage company management teams and secure capital raise fees i think ekso is one of the worst examples of this ive seen lets take classic bank ladenburg for example and review the steaming garbage they try to pass off as a financial model credit ladenburg ignoring the apparently delusional sales estimates hilariously ladenburgs price target assumes zero dilution and completely misses the working capital and cash dynamics explained above if ekso were really going to sell suits on the level ladenburg fantasizes about we can run some simple math and see that would require ekso to raise m of capital just for inventory and working capital needs given eksos lack of fraud partner and m market cap these cash needs are obviously impossible just factoring in the necessary dilution alone and using ladenburgs own price target results in a stock price below todays price… doesnt ladenburg understand basic math another absurd thing i want to point out is ladenburg are forecasting asp will actually increase into infinity by  as we have seen competition is increasing dramatically and ekso is already overpriced relative to competitive offerings while the company itself has stated it will try and reduce pricing in the future as we all know for technology adoption to occur prices decrease and we are already seeing that literally right now in the bionics markets no real investor is going to buy this garbage and i find it offensive just stop already pic credit me ekso previously had m of monthly cash burn and is guiding to increased hiring while none of its commentary includes the increasing cash use the new exoskeleton leaserental dynamic will require in  alone we see ekso lost m and given the above dynamics we understand now we can be sure that number is set to increase since ekso only has m in cash we can see its previous guidance of survival until q  is no longer realistic and ekso will be forced to try and raise more cash much sooner meanwhile ekso insiders pillaging the company for millions shareholders get destroyed by dilution now that we understand ekso is a financial disaster created by jailed fraudster gottbetter and with no hope of commercial success what are ekso insiders doing with this worthless mess chart built by me note that insider compensation in  is  higher than  and total compensation is nearly what ekso total  revenue was how have ekso insiders and jailed financing partner afforded these egregious payments by absolutely pillaging their shareholders with an unbelievable amount of dilution chart built by me this is a crippling and unsustainable path of shareholder destruction and given everything weve seen here im not surprised ekso could only raise money with the help of a jailed fraudster and alleged stock price manipulator ekso cash burn increasing bankruptcy inevitable rwlk clearly a superior choice for speculation if you must speculate on exoskeleton stocks ekso seems clearly the worst of the worst rwlk is a real company with credible management has more product revenue more market share is already fda approved in both home and clinic has vastly superior technology with a cheaper exo product and is also a cheaper stock given lower m market cap with m in cash nearly twice the cash ekso has furthermore rwlk is covered by real banks like barclays and jefferies which coupled with a real product and real management means it is much better equipped to raise capital compare this to ekso which is intertwined with countless people facing fraud and other allegations and is surrounded by banks like ladenburg and hc wainwright rwlk has real sophisticated institutional investors supporting the company like yaskawa electric and israel healthcare while ekso is largely owned by unsophisticated retail investors and a guy jailed for fraud for all these reasons and more i believe it is obvious why rwlk had a real ipo supported by real banks while ekso was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy with workers furloughed and forced into a sketchy backdoor reversemerger while partnering with a jailed fraudster if you insist on speculating in small longshot bionics companies then rwlk is obviously a better choice and the cheaper stock if you prefer venture capital or private businesses then us bionics created by the individual responsible for eksos original technology is far more exciting with a much higher chance of success ekso management nonresponse repeated attempts to contact ekso management in order to clarify the serious issues discusses went unanswered furthermore there appears to be zero way for ekso stockholders to contact the company they own directly i view this lack of transparency and shareholder communication to be a huge red flag and urge all ekso stockholders to directly contact the management team that is in charge of their company immediately furthermore i look forward to public clarification of the many issues at play here as i am very concerned ekso valuation eksos temporarily stretched valuation of x revenue is clearly unsustainable and absurd i believe this crazy valuation is only possible due to paid stock promotion and confused retail investors note ekso is a manufacturing medical equipment company which is attempting to produce mechanical equipment in a richmond warehouse which is both capital intensive working capital intensive and not scalable this is not a software or biotech company that will have huge margins and can grow overnight even hyper growth medical equipment companies with extremely bullish futures are typically valued at x revenue i think ekso is clearly a financial disaster and likely to go bankrupt but in the interest of being optimistic lets assume ekso is worth what high quality growing peer medicalequipment companies are valued at chart built by me as you can see even in a best case scenario ekso stock has  downside right now however i think there is a good chance eksos coming capital raise fails and ekso just goes bankrupt in less than  months leaving the stock worthless plungey battles stock market darkness for shareholders everywhere ekso future price  pic credit starwars and me conclusion ekso is clearly fundamentally worthless and imploding any medical patient finding relief or making progress is a brave individual who gets nothing but respect from me and this research has nothing to do with any of you out there i want to see injured people walk freely more than anyone and some of the companies in this space will make great strides in the future to help people this is why i find ekso with its fraud partnership paid stock promotion and unrealistic hype to be offensive and distasteful  it is destroying capital at the expense of real companies doing excellent work in the exobionics field and that hurts all of us i believe it is obvious now that a sketchy reversemerger led by people jailed for fraud and facing other allegations who enrich themselves to the tune of millions while spending minimal cash on rd are not going to be the ones to cure the worlds problems the kind of true institutional investors required to feed eksos m cash burn needs are going to require more than misleading partnership press releases and paid stock promotion it will require real revenue and earnings neither of which ekso is capable of generating this is why ekso was on deaths door in  why nobody bought it outright when it almost disappeared and why ekso has never successfully raised largescale capital aside from when it partnered with jailed fraudster gottbetter now that he is in prison and unable to finagle money from questionable investment firms while opaleye is neck deep in ekso stock and clearly looking to sell i think ekso will fail to raise the necessary capital and cease to exist not that it matters to insiders though as i imagine they will keep their millions in compensation and any stocks sale proceeds i can only speculate on whatever law enforcement investigation ekso may be facing and believe ekso employees show ekso is imploding as we speak fair value indicates minimum  immediate best case downside for ekso stock and as the industry continues to move to a leaserent model which ekso cant afford while its technological inferiority becomes increasingly apparent the stock will likely be vaporized in  by bankruptcy similar to what ekso experienced in  when it previously failed to raise capital disclosure the author is short ekso the author wrote this article
