delivering electrical energy in alaska is providing adequate reliable electrical infrastructure in alaska’s extreme environment and across its wide geographical expanse for utilities on the railbelt system there may be opportunities to access lower cost energy from efficient gas generation facilities and renewables which cannot be realized due to unreliable transmission infrastructure and insufficient path redundancy for remote alaska villages highcost electricity from local dieselbased generation could be displaced with renewables and distant lowercost generation if adequate transmission and storage infrastructure were available for the oil  gas industry aging infrastructure and project economics demand a more efficient and optimized electrical infrastructure for continued profit and growth on alaska’s north slope the need for advanced electrical and storage infrastructure is no greater than anywhere else than in alaska abb has maintained a steady research and

integration into the power chain systems an electrical battery is a combination of one or more electrochemical cells used to convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy batteries form the main storage component for energy storage systems with a huge range of technologies and chemistries available from single lead acid to more exotics such as liion nicd sodium sulphur nas and vanadium redox flow the prime function of the battery energy storage system bess is to provide spinning reserve in the event of power plant or transmission line equipment failure for these systems rechargeable batteries are used to store electricity in the form of chemical energy abb has different kinds of bess equipped with the corresponding converter battery energy storage key benefits power chain management finding the optimum solution references key benefits stability and flexibility one of the key benefits of abb’s battery energy storage systems is their contribution to maintaining grid stability and flexibility through effective energy storage and power flow management enhancing grid stability and flexibility and delivering powerondemand whenever it is needed harnessing renewables the integration of renewable sources without supporting storage technologies exposes the grid to stability issues due to the inherent intermittency of wind solar and marine power the grid integration of renewable energy sources in combination with battery energy storage systems reduces the intermittency of renewable sources increasing their capacity factor in addition energy storage can prevent wastage of excess renewable energy feeding into the grid at times when production is at a peak but demand is low instead this energy is now stored effectively power quality abb technology is already used extensively for the management of reactive power the addition of our battery energy storage systems provides a further dimension – the management of active power our power converter systems have the capability to meet both reactive and active power needs providing the grid with the flexibility to manage any situation at any time in the daily demand cycle and for prolonged periods of time infrastructure the integration of battery energy storage systems into transmission and distribution networks has the potential to provide significant benefits at all points in the power chain abb’s complete range of battery energy storage systems is designed to cover all scenarios from new to existing infrastructure and small to large installations our battery systems can improve the power

vehicles will have a considerable impact on the demand for electricity and the development of future power grids the production of electric vehicles is predicted to rise dramatically as automotive manufacturers look for alternative means of powering their vehicles integrating abb’s battery energy storage systems into existing and new grids will facilitate vehicle electrification programs by ensuring a stable and consistent supply of the electricity vital to charge their onboard batteries battery energy storage key benefits power chain management finding the optimum solution references active power chain management as a leader in power and automation abb has developed its battery energy storage systems to actively manage a variety of issues in the power value chain load leveling the use of energy storage is a natural and effective complement to load levelling that makes it possible to store excess energy produced when demand is low and then make it available when demand is high this approach is particularly useful in industrial applications where for example there may be sufficient energy available for the load but occasionally insufficient power in this case rather than reinforcing the plant feeder an energy storage installation can be a more costeffective and faster to implement solution peak power shaving our battery energy storage systems offer peak power shaving capabilities by delivering stored energy to the grid during periods of high demand reducing the burden on the distribution network this effectively reduces the gap between peak and average demand improving the overall efficiency with which the electrical energy is used power smoothing power smoothing to prevent sudden surges or drops in power supply is another key advantage of our battery energy storage systems the stored energy smoothes out any erratic power from intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar power plants so that the utility receives constant and consistent power islanding in islanding applications energy stored in our storage systems can be used to supply network power to a section of the grid whenever utility power is not available dynamic frequency control regulation of grid frequency within preset limits is another key area of demand management to avoid power supply interruptions due to the whole grid “slowing down” our battery energy storage systems

tomorrows hvdc grid war of the currents the breakthrough hvdc history the technology the evolution frequently asked questions the solution hvdc high voltage direct current and hvdc light hvdc high voltage direct current and hvdc light® are systems for transmission of electric power both systems are applied to meet special requirements in power grids and consist of a cable or line for direct current and two or more converter stations this page will try to explain where hvdc and hvdc light can be used and what the benefits are with a few exceptions all power lines you see in your surroundings carry alternating current ac that oscillates with  or  cycles per second  whether they are for extra high voltage for medium voltage or for the low voltage distribution grid these lines form a large interconnected network that ties the power generation plants coal gas nuclear hydro wind etc to the consumers but where does hvdc come in it is used to interconnect separate power systems where traditional alternating current ac connections can not be used the classical hvdc technique was first introduced in sweden gotland link in  by asea a founding company of abb today there are over  projects in all parts of the world typically a classical hvdc transmission has a power of more than  megawatt mw and many are in the    mw range there are classical hvdc transmissions that use overhead lines and that use undersea and underground cables or combinations of cables and lines hvdc light® can be called the invisible power transmission since it is based on underground cables although over head lines also are a possibility it is a fundamentally new power transmission technology developed by abb in the s hvdc light uses underground or submarine cables the technology extends the economical power range of hvdc transmission down to just a few tens of megawatts mw in the upper range the technology can reach  mw and ± kv in both classical hvdc and hvdc light it is possible to transmit power in both directions applications for classical hvdc in summary we find the use for classical hvdc in a power system · long undersea cable links   km · long overhead lines   km · interconnection of different grids or networks · where control of transmitted power is of importance · combinations of the above · applications for hvdc light® the same applications as for classical hvdc are valid also for hvdc light but due to the smaller power rating of hvdc light its underground cable technology and its superior controllability there are many more potential applications than for classical hvdc the fact that it is possible to build a long electric power transmission underground and avoid public opposition and long uncertain approval processes makes the hvdc light system very attractive some of the hvdc light applications that are in commercial operation are listed here · long underground cable link  km gotland hvdc light from a wind park sweden · long underground cable links  km terranora interconnector   km murraylink between different grids australia · undersea cable link  km cross sound cable to long island ny usa · long undersea cable link  km troll a to feed power to an offshore gas production platform norway · interconnection of different grids eagle passusa one of the characteristics of hvdc light is its superior ability to stabilize the ac voltage at the terminals this is particularly important for wind parks where the variation in wind speed can cause severe voltage fluctuations hvdc light has also the potential of becoming the preferred system for power in feeds to cities for strengthening of power networks in areas where the public is opposed to new overhead lines and for evacuation of trapped marginal generation resources where a new extra high voltage ac line would be too costly but this requires thinking outside the box read more overview why hvdc power stations generate alternating current ac and the power delivered to the consumers is in the form of ac why then is it sometimes more suitable to use direct current hvdc for transmitting electric power each individual transmission project will display its own set of reasons justifying the choice of hvdc but the most common arguments favoring hvdc are · lower losses · long distance water crossing · asynchronous interconnections · controllability · limit short circuit currents · environment · lower investment cost in general terms the different reasons for using hvdc can be divided in two main groups namely  hvdc is necessary or desirable from the technical point of view ie controllability  hvdc results in a lower total investment including lower losses andor is environmentally superior today the environmental aspects are also becoming more important hvdc is in that respect favorable in many cases as the environmental impact is less than with ac this is due to the fact that an hvdc transmission line is much smaller and needs less space than ac lines for the same power capacity th century debate shaped the power industry as we know it today perhaps the biggest technology debate that shaped the power industry was played out in new york in the th century ac alternating current versus dc direct current tesla vs edison ac vs dc few remember the debate itself but the characters are still well known you had thomas edison image right and ge on one side pushing for the power transmission and distribution system to be based on dc on the other side nikola tesla image left and westinghouse put all their effort into promoting ac with electricity supplies in their infancy much depended on choosing the right technology to power homes and businesses across the country this was when the industrial revolution was accelerating in the us and famous men like andrew carnegie jp morgan and others where known for their aggressive industrial growth practices and the two sides in this conflict didn’t have too many scruples either dc’s leading supporters often resorted to very questionable marketing practices to exaggerate the dangers of ac but the dirty tricks didn’t help and the war of the currents was won by ac which has been the platform for electrical transmission across the world since that time however new york city being the battle ground for this war had already invested in a number of edison dc installations and these of course continued to work for many years alongside the growing ac network it wasn’t until  that new york decided to replace the dc equipment and it wasn’t until  – just four years ago – that the last of it was removed – a full  years after the end of the war of the currents but while ac was perfectly adequate for the conditions of the day – and for much of the th century – the needs of the st century are showing its limits and the irony is that although edison lost the battle his direct current is making a comeback just as new york city has finally rid itself of the standard today it is not a question of ac versus dc but of ac and dc this is because we are facing a revolution in the way our electricity is produced and used on the production side more and more electricity is being generated from renewable sources of energy either in remote areas hydropower plants in mountains far from urban centers offshore wind farms or locally rooftop solar panels dc is the only technology that allows power to be transmitted economically over very long distances and dc is the type of power produced by photovoltaic panels as far as using power is concerned more and more equipment runs on dc such as computers cell phones and led lights at the moment each of these appliances uses its own rectifier to switch power from ac to dc a much more efficient solution would be to convert the power in a larger rectifier as it enters each building abb estimates the savings from using dc instead of ac in buildings could be in the order of  to  percent losses could be further reduced by converting power to dc at the substation level and distributing dc power throughout an entire district or even by transmitting distributing and using power as dc for these scenarios some technological challenges remain – such as the development of dc breakers – but will likely be overcome within a few years batteries are another technology that runs on dc power and there are more and more of these around us storing excess power produced from renewable energy installations during favorable weather conditions and powering electric cars it would be impractical and expensive to implement dc distribution grids where ac distribution grids already exist but dc may increasingly become the solution of choice in new districts or cities where new communities are electrified for the first time and where electrification “islands” not connected to the main power network are created such islands include new ships and communities generating their own power from renewable resources dc distribution would be particularly attractive for communities using power generated by photovoltaic solar panels since this is already dc power and currently has to be converted to ac before distribution in addition dc offers greater capacity per power line reducing the weight and size of power equipment throughout the grid and home and can help to improve the reliability of power supplies as it is easier to control the voltage on dc lines and because dc connections do not cascade faults and cause blackouts the way ac lines can do the main benefits of dc based grids would be • greater energy efficiency • higher power quality • smaller equipment • less complexity and lower costs after years of research abb has developed the world’s first circuit breaker for high voltage direct current hvdc the breakthrough removes a yearold barrier to the development of dc transmission grids which will enable the efficient integration and exchange of renewable energy dc grids will also improve grid reliability and

the leading power and automation technology group today announced a breakthrough in the ability to interrupt direct current solving a yearold electrical engineering puzzle and paving the way for a more efficient and reliable electricity supply system read more the hybrid hvdc breaker  november  abb writes new chapter in the history of electrical engineering abb has successfully designed and developed a hybrid dc breaker after years of research functional testing and simulation in the rd laboratories this breaker is a breakthrough that solves a technical challenge that has been unresolved for over a hundred years and was perhaps one the main influencers in the ‘war of currents‘ outcome the ‘hybrid’ breaker combines mechanical and power electronics switching that enables it to interrupt power flows equivalent to the output of a nuclear power station within  milliseconds – that’s as fast as a honey bee takes per flap of its wing – and twice as fast as it takes usain bolt to react to the starter’s gun but its not just about speed the challenge was to do it ‘ultrafast’ with minimal operational losses and this has been achieved by combining advanced ultrafast mechanical actuators with our inhouse semiconductor igbt valve technologies or power electronics watch video hybrid hvdc breaker – how does it work in terms of significance this breaker is a ‘game changer’ it removes a significant stumbling block in the development of hvdc transmission grids where planning can start now these grids will enable interconnection and load balancing between hvdc power superhighways integrating renewables and transporting bulk power across long distances with minimal losses dc grids will enable sharing of resources like lines and converter stations that provides reliability and redundancy in a power network in an economically viable manner with minimal losses abb’s new hybrid hvdc breaker in simple terms will enable the transmission system to maintain power flow even if there is a fault on one of the lines this is a major achievement for the global rd team in abb who have worked for years on the challenge and finally come up with a circuit breaker capable of blocking and breaking dc currents at thousands of amperes and several hundred thousands of volts  corresponding to the average power consumption of one million europeans  it amounts to stopping power capable of feeding a large city much faster than an eye blink  this speed helps protect the dc transmission system and prevent power outages in new low loss compact power superhighways the next step is to install the breaker in pilot installations hvdc transmission remains a technology of choice for bulk power transmission over long distances with minimum losses hvdc lines also require less space and are capable of going underground or underwater voltage source converter based hvdc applications in embedded ac grids and for offshore connections have grown substantially in line with quantum leaps in power ratings and significant loss reductions abb pioneered hvdc transmission nearly  years ago and accounts for half the world’s hvdc installed base it is befitting that the company that commissioned the world’s first  kilovolt uhvdc systems the longest overhead hvdc link to go into commercial operation the world’s longest underwater and underground hvdc links now writes the next chapter in the history of this technology and marks an important milestone in the legacy of electrical engineering from humble beginnings from joining the dots to connecting the lines the ability to transfer large quantities of electricity across vast distances with low losses and using minimal space combined with the feasibility of going underwater or underground make hvdc high voltage direct current a sought after technology across the world but it came from humble beginnings hvdc a history hvdc and hvdc light hvdc high voltage direct current and hvdc light are highly efficient alternatives for transmitting bulk power and for special purpose applications the classic hvdc technology is used to transmit electric power over long distances it is also used to interconnect separate power systems

enhance reliability and improve the efficiency of energy systems around the world our unparalleled range of products systems and services provide solutions for power generation transmission systems and distribution networks frequently asked questions what is alternating current alternating current is a form of electricity in which the current alternates in direction and the voltage alternates in polarity at a frequency defined by the generator usually between  and  times per second ie    hertz ac was adopted for power transmission in the early days of electricity supply because it had two major advantages over direct current dc its voltage could be stepped up or down according to need using transformers and it could be interrupted more easily than dc what is direct current this is electrical current that does not alternate see alternating current the electrons flow through the circuit in one direction as a result dc does not generate reactive power see reactive power this means that in a dc system only real or active power is transmitted making better use of the system’s capacity the transmission of dc current has very low losses what is reactive power it is a concept that describes the loss of power in a system resulting from the production of electric and magnetic fields in it what is the dc grid today’s electrical transmission systems are almost exclusively based on alternating current ac but the development of highvoltage direct current hvdc technology has made it possible to build a dc grid that can handle bulk power flows over long distances power from such dc grids can be fed into the ac networks as needed what is highvoltage direct current hvdc a technology developed by abb in the s to move large amounts of power over substantial distances  typically by overhead transmission lines but also by way of submarine cables another important aspect of hvdc lines is that they can never be overloaded because hvdc transmits only active real power no line capacity is wasted on transmitting reactive power this means that the same power can be transmitted over fewer or smaller transmission lines than would be required using ac and less land is needed to accommodate the lines hvdc induces minimal magnetic fields so the power lines may be built safely closer to human habitation what is hvdc light an adaptation of classic hvdc developed by abb in the s it can be used to transmit electricity in lower power ranges tens of megawatts to an upper range of  megawatt mw ± kilovoltshvdc light offers the same benefits as traditional hvdc systems but also provides more secure power control superior to classic hvdc and quick power restoration in the event of a blackout it is the only technology available that allows longdistance underground highvoltage transmission what is a converter station special equipment is needed to convert electricity from alternating current ac to direct current dc or vice versa hvdc converter stations use power electronic devices called thyristors to make these conversions what is a thyristor a thyristor is a semiconductor device used in hvdc installations as a highspeed highpower switch capable of turning power supplies of many megawatts on within a split second thyristors are a component used in inverters and rectifiers see also inverter and rectifier what is a semiconductor a semiconductor is a material whose electrical properties can be significantly influenced by physical factors mostly electrical conditions but also pressure temperature light etc this means that a semiconductor will behave either as an insulator or a conductor of electricity depending on the conditions to which it is exposed what is an inverter an electrical device for converting direct current dc into alternating current ac what is an rectifier an electrical device used to convert alternating current ac into direct current dc what is an circuit breaker devices that interrupt high currents to protect electrical equipment from damage caused by current surges eg from a short circuit or a lightning strike on a much smaller scale they are used as an alternative to fuses in the home what is switchgear equipment used to control protect and regulate the flow of electrical power in a transmission or distribution network it is often located in substations but can be associated with any electrical equipment that might need to be isolated for fault correction eg if a voltage drop occurred in one part of the grid it might be necessary to shut off the affected section to prevent the fault spreading or for maintenance purposes the main components of switchgear are circuit breakers which interrupt highvoltage current to protect electrical equipment from excessive current what is meant by transmission and distribution td transmission is the movement of power at high voltage above ca  kv usually over long distances raising the voltage allows power to be transmitted more efficiently ie with lower losses distribution is the transport of electricity at medium voltage between ca  and  kv over shorter distances to industrial commercial and residential areas abb  power and productivity for a better world
