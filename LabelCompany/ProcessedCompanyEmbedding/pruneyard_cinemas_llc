camera  cinemas will be closed for construction from april to september  by jasmine leyva  jleyvabayareanewsgroupcom  bay area news grouppublished march  0 at  am  updated march  0 at  amcamera  cinemas at the pruneyard shopping center will close in april so management can get to work on construction that will change the theatergoing experience the sevenscreen movie theater at  s bascom ave will be remodeled to include a restaurant and full bar and will be renamed pruneyard cinemas owner jack nyblom and his partner ed rathmann said they hope to begin construction in april with a reopening in september “we’re designing it right now” rathmann told this newspaper “it won’t look anything like it does now because we’re taking over the pizza my heart space” the pizza joint is located inside the lobby of the theater the space will be transformed to accommodate a kitchen and the former boswell’s bar next door will be remodeled into a full bar according to nyblom and rathmann planned improvements in the theater include installing  reclining seats constructing a seat restaurant expanding the lobby and concession area and making room for new offices storage and an employee room patio seating is planned all seven theater screens will remain “it will be a completely different experience” rathmann said “i think what’s happening is that every theater in the country wants to do this or is doing this because the old style of ‘come watch a movie’ isn’t working as well” according to nyblom the new restaurant and bar will be open to the public and will not require a movie ticket moviegoers will also have the option to purchase tickets online reserve their seats ahead of time and have food delivered to their seats nyblom said names for the restaurant and bar have not been finalized yet the theater will also see its ownership structure change according to a business plan pruneyard cinemas llc will purchase camera  cinemas limited partnership which has four years

stay on as principals of pruneyard cinemas “the new owners of the pruneyard are doing a massive remodel” rathmann said “they want us to be the focal point on it so they are investing a lot of money into the theater to make it happen” nyblom is the founder and managing partner of camera cinemas rathmann is the managing partner of willow street wood fired pizza and main street burger ellis
