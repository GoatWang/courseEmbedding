alternatives  morgan stanley search the peachtree group page the peachtree groupcontact us investing adding diversification with liquid alternatives for most investors alternative investments bring to mind complex investment strategies available only to institutions and the ultra wealthy through private illiquid partnerships that charge high fees however with the recent growth of liquid alternatives many of these strategies are now available through mutual funds and exchange traded funds etfs and investor access to these once exclusive investment strategies is expanding alternative investments comprise a multiplicity of asset classes and strategies they are basically defined as any investment that falls outside the traditional asset classes of stocks bonds and cash the universe includes but is not limited to commodities private real estate managed futures precious metals private equity and numerous hedged strategies liquid alternatives unlike private offerings do not require investor prequalification have relatively low investment minimums and provide portfolio improved transparency daily liquidity and net asset value pricing performance of a liquid alternative fund however may vary from a private offering with a similar objective because of statutory limits on illiquidity leverage short sales and derivative securities the common thread uniting private and liquid alternatives is they both tend to generate returns that have low or negative correlation with traditional asset classes and as a result may be used as a tool to diversify portfolio risk and mitigate a significant decline in any one holding or investment type refining asset allocation equities have historically been the driver of longterm investment growth but they are also the asset class with the greatest risk of loss suppose in  you added a  allocation of diversified alternative asset classes and strategies to a conventional portfolio of  stocks  bonds and  cash resulting in a new portfolio of  stocks  bonds  cash and the balance in alternatives by the end of  the portfolio with alternatives would have earned a  average annual return compared with  for the traditional portfolio annual volatility for the portfolio with alternatives was  versus  for the traditional portfolio the alternatives’ uncorrelated returns serve as a buffer muting the overall severity of drawdowns and creating outcomes that were still equitylike but with a bit lower volatility as we enter a period in which interest rates are forecast to rise and equity and bond price are expected to be volatile liquid alternatives may likely play a similar role in portfolio diversification for smaller investors here’s why diversifying an equity portfolio with an allocation to bonds and cash is the conventional risk management tool for most investors however the end of a year bull market for bonds in —combined with an impending interest rate increase interest rate normalization— has raised questions about the viability of this longheld strategy in the view of morgan stanley wealth management’s global investment committee the process of interest rate normalization is likely to produce aboveaverage volatility in both stocks and bonds against a backdrop of muted subpar growth investors will need to look at other methods in an effort to improve returns and reduce volatility liquid alternatives are a possible solution  talk with your morgan stanley financial advisor to see if your portfolio might benefit from an allocation to this emerging market segment  morgan stanley smith barney llc member
