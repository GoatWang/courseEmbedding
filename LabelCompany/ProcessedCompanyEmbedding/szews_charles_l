corporate culture by szews charles l read preview article excerpt customers suppliers and employees seek to work with companies that sustain a strong reputation built not only on the quality of a companys products and services but also on the trust that in every interaction a company will do the right thingthe impetus to do the right thing becomes that much stronger when the company is engaged in the provision of products to warfighters in the defense industry doing the right thing protects american lives and has national security implicationsthis reality is at the heart of the national defense industrial associations code of ethics which it created as a best practices guide for its membership creating a company culture to do the right thing doesnt happen by chance but by design and
