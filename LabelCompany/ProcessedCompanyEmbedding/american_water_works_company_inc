probably dont think about your tap water too often but you should  it could be a huge investment opportunity reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer apr   at am image source american water works american water works company nyseawk isnt a household name and while its a utility this water company seems to get hidden under all of the electric providers that hog the utility spotlight but that shouldnt stop you from paying close attention to its stock because it wouldnt take much for it to soar even higher that it has here are three things to watch  costly fixesamerican water works is a utility it has monopoly power but it has to get its rates approved by the government thats a tradeoff that works reasonably well and creates a stable business only theres something different in the water space neglect our water infrastructure is old and needs huge upgrades putting a number on this american water works explains that by  over  trillion will need to be spent to upgrade us water systems lots of pipes to fix image source american water works because water is a basic necessity these investments really arent optional and that plays right into a water utilitys hands since regulators provide rate increases for spending on improvements like the ones that really have to be made thats a core reason american water expects to generate growth of around  to  from its regulated business between  and  the growth that goes along with this spending should help to attract more investors to the american water works story oh just for reference the company spent more on capital projects last year than it ever has before  thats a lot of moneybut theres more to watch here roughly  of water systems and nearly  of wastewater systems are owned by municipalities or some other nonpublic entity thats an opportunity for a large diversified water player like american water works to add new water systems to the over  it currently runs take a step back and think about that american water works owns around  water systems and there are other big players in the industry such as suez environmental and united utilities group and still only  or so of the us water business rests in the hands of public companies and virtually none of the waste water business now look at the finances of local towns and cities and compare that to the bills they are likely to face to upgrade their water systems american water works and its peers are likely to become increasingly desirable partners for cash strapped towns and not just because selling a water system will raise revenue today but because it will save the municipalities from huge bills or worse down the line lots of room for acquisition growth image source american water works acquisitions then should be a huge opportunity for american water works to keep growing its business but that will also keep its capital spending high which regulators should reward with rate increases as all of this unfolds investors are likely to continue to push the shares higher  dividend growthat this point you could get drawn into a discussion of american water works other businesses such as dealing with the water used for drilling for oil and gas thats an interesting sideline that could lead to higher growth but focusing on it would miss a key point you see american water works isnt just a utility its a utility thats managed to increase its dividend at an annualized rate of over  for the past five years last year it jumped that payout by nearly  you could counter that investors already know this story which is why the shares yield just  or so today but some of the largest electricity companies such as southern company nyseso and duke energy nyseduk managed only lowsingledigit dividend growth over that span southerns dividend growth of  annualized over the past five years only managed to squeak by the historical pace of inflation around  while dukes  fell short of that mark american water works dividend on the other hand grew three times as fast awk data by ycharts if american water works can keep up that kind of dividend growth which looks likely based on the amount of money it has to spend on its regulated systems investors should keep rewarding the shares in lock step with the dividend increases note that american water works paid a special dividend in  that led to the odd bump in the dividend line of the preceding graph you might look at all of this and think back to other acquisitionled growth areas like pipeline mlps that havent worked out so well first american water works has a reasonable amount of debt for a utility at around  of the capital structure and while the pipelines mlps own are regulated the need for transporting oil and gas is materially different than the biological need for waterand proper care and upgrading of an ageing us water system thats not to suggest that you shouldnt keep an eye on american water works finances but oil pipelines and water utilities are very different industries    opportunity for a higher priceadd it all up and it looks like the stars are aligned for a higher stock price at american water works over the long term first it has builtin growth from the spending that it has to do and that regulators frankly want it to do second as municipalities look at the bills to fix their own systems a lot are going to look to partner up with a company like american water works  which will further boost growth at the company and third all of this should lead to robust dividend growth which investors love forget adding another boring old electric utility to your portfolio  american water works shares look like they could continue to soar and pay you well along the way too reuben brewer has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends
