defined we first trust portfolios lp the sponsor have created hundreds of similar yet separate series of an investment company which we have named the first trust combined series the series to which this prospectus relates the first trust combined series  consists of a single portfolio known as build america bonds portfolio series  we anticipate depositing the first trust combined series  on or about august   however for a variety of reasons we may elect to postpone or cancel the deposit or if we proceed with the deposit we may elect to create fewer units than we currently anticipate the trust was created under the laws of the state of new york by a trust agreement the indenture dated the initial date of deposit this agreement entered into between first trust portfolios lp as sponsor the bank of new york mellon as trustee ftp services llc ftps as ftps unit servicing agent and first trust advisors lp as portfolio supervisor and evaluator governs the operation of the trust you may get more specific details concerning the nature structure and risks of this product in an information supplement by calling the sponsor at  ext  how we created the trust on the initial date of deposit we deposited municipal bonds andor contracts for municipal bonds including a letter of credit or the equivalent with the trustee and in turn the trustee delivered documents to us representing our ownership of the trust in the form of units units after the initial date of deposit we may deposit additional securities in the trust or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to buy more securities to create new units for sale if we create additional units we will attempt to the extent practicable to maintain the percentage relationship established among the securities on the initial date of deposit as set forth under schedule of investments adjusted to reflect the occurrence of an event which affects the capital structure of the issuer of a security or a sale of a security made as described in removing securities from the trust since the prices of the securities will fluctuate daily the ratio of securities in the trust on a market value basis will also change daily the portion of securities represented by each unit will not change as a result of the deposit of additional securities in the trust if we deposit cash you and new investors may experience a dilution of your investment this is because prices of securities will fluctuate between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust pays the associated brokerage fees to reduce this dilution the trust will try to buy the securities as close to the evaluation time and as close to the evaluation price as possible in addition because the trust pays the brokerage fees associated with the creation of new units and with the sale of securities to meet redemption and exchange requests frequent redemption and exchange activity will likely result in higher brokerage expenses an affiliate of the trustee may receive these brokerage fees or the trustee may retain and pay us or our affiliate to act as agent for the trust to buy securities if we or an affiliate of ours act as agent to the trust we will be subject to the restrictions under the investment company act of  as amended the  act we cannot guarantee that the trust will keep its present size and composition for any length of time securities will mature or may be redeemed prior to the termination date or may be periodically sold under certain circumstances to satisfy trust obligations to meet redemption requests and as described in removing securities from the trust to maintain the sound investment character of the trust and the proceeds received by the trust will be used to meet trust obligations or distributed to unit holders but will not be reinvested however securities will not be sold to take advantage of market fluctuations or changes in anticipated rates of appreciation or depreciation or if they no longer meet the criteria by which they were selected you will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the securities in the trust as the holder of the securities the trustee will vote the securities and will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are the securities held by owners other than such trust neither we nor the trustee will be liable for a failure in any of the securities however if a contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially deposited in the trust fails unless we can purchase substitute securities replacement securities we will refund to you that portion of the purchase price and sales charge resulting from the failed contract on the next distribution date any replacement security the trust acquires will meet requirements specified in the indenture page  portfolio objectives the trust seeks to distribute income and preserve capital by investing in a professionally selected fixed portfolio of investment grade taxable municipal bonds under normal circumstances at least  of the trusts portfolio will consist of bonds issued under the build america bond provision of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  but the trust may also invest in other taxable municipal bonds build americas infrastructure with bonds a municipal bond is a debt obligation of a state andor local government entity which can be used to help build americas infrastructure by raising money to finance public projects such as new hospitals schools and improved roads with the signing into law of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  an entirely new type of taxable municipal bond was createdbuild america bonds or babs essentially build america bonds are identical to traditional taxexempt issues except the interest is taxable at the federal and possibly state and local level babs provided state and local governments with a new method of financing capital projects with the aid of a federal subsidy the subsidy was intended to ease the burden of budgetarypressured state and local governments and to stimulate spending on a variety of public projects the federal government reimburses the municipality  of the interest paid on the bonds  in the case of certain bonds thereby reducing their net interest cost the subsidy provided by the government allowed issuers to offer higher interest rates on bonds than they do on their taxfree debt while offsetting some or all of the additional financing burden the bab program expired at the end of  there is no assurance that the bab program will be continued in the future or if it is continued that the program terms will not be modified possibly significantly build america bonds ataglance o part of the us governments plan to fund infrastructure o us government will subsidize   in the case of certain bonds of the interest payment on taxable bonds issued as direct pay babs directly to the issuers of such securities o municipal bonds have historically low default rates and relatively low volatility o provide taxable income o generally high credit quality o interest will be treated as state taxexempt in those states that treat municipal bond interest as exempt from state income tax growth in bab issuance increased demand growth in babs issuance throughout the programs existence was spurred by investor demand since babs represented a new taxable fixed income option for investors to augment corporate asset backed federal agency and treasury bonds in addition babs have drawn interest from investors who are not typically purchasers of taxexempt bonds because they dont benefit from federal tax exemption such as foreign investors who have no us tax liability or pension funds that are not required to pay taxes the first babs were sold on april   and by the end of  a total of  billion in babs were issued in  another  billion had been issued since  all  states and the district of columbia have participated in the program securities industry and financial markets association sifma increased share of issuance states and local governments have always issued taxable debt accounting for an average of  of overall long term issuance since  municipal securities rulemaking board the emergence of babs however led to record levels of issuance of taxable municipal securities municipal securities rulemaking board from the first bab issuance on april   through the end of  babs accounted for  of longterm securities issued in the municipal market sifma in  babs share grew to account for  of long term municipal bond issuance the appeal of taxable municipal bonds lower default rates than corporate bonds municipal bonds have historically had a very low overall default rate as compared to corporate bonds according to data from moodys the historical default rate of moodysrated municipal bonds is lower than that of corporate bonds in every rating category in fact despite the economic struggles facing many states and municipalities investment grade municipal bonds have experienced significantly lower default rates than even the highest rated corporate bonds one reason for the historically lower default rates has been due to the relatively more stable revenue streams of municipalities which have the ability to levy taxes to offset declining revenues corporate revenues on the other hand can be more volatile as they have fewer ways to increase revenues during difficult economic periods page  attractive yields the subsidy provided by the government enables bab issuers to offer yields at attractive spreads over comparable traditional types of taxable bonds such as treasury bonds and corporate bonds although the interest on the bonds is taxable for federal purposes states are permitted to treat the interest as exempt from state taxes the taxable bond marketplace is often short on supply of longerdated taxable bonds which has made babs a popular option for both institutional and individual investors who are attracted to the higher yields relative to other taxable bonds investment grade taxable yields year

thorough analysis of the credit quality of any bond is critically important in light of the challenges present in the municipal market today relying on a bonds rating does not adequately inform investors about the inherent credit quality of the bond at first trust we take a thorough approach to analyzing municipal securities that are under consideration for inclusion in our unit investment trusts our analysts use a multiple factor approach when evaluating the credit strength of a bond factors specific to different sectors of the municipal market enter into the analysis as well as comparisons to peers to do so our analysts assess the financial strength of the obligor by examining its fiscal health and economic health we determine the relative strength of protection afforded the bondholder by the legal and contractual elements of the bond documents and we look to other qualitative factors that could enhance or compromise the credit strength of the bond assessing municipal credit risk the goal of our credit analysis is primarily twofold o avoidance of potentially severe credit impairment especially default o determining probability of transitional credit events leading to credit quality volatility or degradation although municipal bonds have exhibited a very low rate of default defaults can and do happen however it is more common for the credit quality of a bond to become worse over timea negative credit transition by thoroughly analyzing every bond we seek to identify and avoid those bonds that have the potential for adverse credit developments in the future unlike other fixed income investment alternatives once a unit investment trust is established new bonds cannot be added or substituted for the trusts holdings therefore we approach the analysis of each and every security with the understanding that they will be held in any given portfolio for a long period of time the purpose of our credit analysis is to identify securities that we believe will stand the test of time for the duration of the life of the trust as of the initial date of deposit all of the securities were rated bbb or better by standard  poors andor another nationally recognized statistical rating organization see description of bond ratings after the initial date of deposit a securitys rating may be lowered this would not immediately cause the security to be removed from the trust but may be considered by us in determining whether to direct the trustee to dispose of such security see removing securities from the trust the trust has an expected life of approximately  years a diversified portfolio helps to offset the risks normally associated with such an investment although it does not eliminate them entirely of course as with any similar investments there can be no guarantee that the objectives of the trust will be achieved see risk factors for a discussion of the risks of investing in the trust estimated returns the estimated current and longterm returns set forth in the summary of essential information are estimates and are designed to be comparative rather than predictive we cannot predict your actual return which will vary with unit price how long you hold your investment and with changes in the portfolio interest income and expenses in addition neither rate reflects the true return you will receive which will be lower because neither includes the effect of certain delays in distributions with respect to when the securities pay interest and when distributions are paid by the trust estimated current return equals the estimated annual interest income to be received from the securities less estimated annual trust expenses divided by the public offering price per unit page  which includes the initial sales charge estimated longterm return is a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of the trust and is calculated using a formula which  factors in the market values yields which take into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the securities and  takes into account a compounding factor the sales charge and expenses unlike estimated current return estimated longterm return reflects maturities discounts and premiums of the securities in the trust we will provide you with estimated cash flows for the trust at no charge upon your request risk factors price volatility the trust invests in municipal bonds the value of the securities will decline with increases in interest rates not only because increases in rates generally decrease values but also because increased rates may indicate an economic slowdown an economic slowdown or a reduction in an issuers creditworthiness may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal payments the value of the securities will also fluctuate with changes in investors perceptions of an issuers financial condition or the general condition of the municipal bond market changes in inflation rates or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur because the trust is not managed the trustee will not sell securities in response to or in anticipation of market fluctuations as is common in managed investments as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time or that you wont lose money units of the trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency interest there is no guarantee that the issuers of the securities will be able to satisfy their interest payment obligations to the trust over the life of the trust current economic conditions the national bureau of economic research announced that the us economys recession which began in december  technically ended in june  despite this announcement economic activity remains below average levels the united states continues to experience increased unemployment and stock markets remain below pre recession levels the recession began with problems in the housing and credit markets many of which were caused by defaults on subprime mortgages and mortgagebacked securities eventually leading to the failures of some large financial institutions and has negatively impacted all sectors of the economy the current economic crisis has also affected the global economy with european and asian markets suffering historic losses due to the current state of uncertainty in the economy the value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers extraordinary steps have been taken by the governments of several leading economic countries to combat the economic crisis however the impact of these measures is not yet known and cannot be predicted the markets for credit instruments including municipal securities have experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility since the latter half of  liquidity in the municipal bond market the ability to buy and sell bonds readily has been reduced general market uncertainty and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety of debt securities including municipal securities in addition during  several major dealers of municipal bonds exited the market via acquisition or bankruptcy these conditions resulted and in many cases continue to result in greater volatility less liquidity widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of uncertain value these market conditions may make valuation of some of the trusts securities uncertain andor result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in its holdings during times of reduced market liquidity such as at the present the trust may not be able to sell securities readily at prices reflecting the values at which the securities are carried on the trusts books sales of large blocks of securities by market participants such as the trust that are seeking liquidity can further reduce security prices in an illiquid market in response to the current national economic downturn governmental cost burdens may be reallocated among federal state and local governments in addition laws enacted in the future by congress or state legislatures or referenda could extend the time for payment of principal andor interest or impose other constraints on enforcement of such obligations or on the ability of municipalities to levy taxes issuers of municipal securities might seek protection under the bankruptcy laws on august   standard  poors ratings services lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the united states of america to aa from aaa in reaching its decision standard  poors cited the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate and their belief that further nearterm page  progress containing the growth in public spending especially on entitlements or on reaching an agreement on revenues is less likely than they previously assumed the impact of the downgrade of the us longterm sovereign credit rating by standard  poors is uncertain but will likely lead to increased interest rates and volatility in the short term municipal securities the trust invests in taxable municipal bonds municipal bonds are debt obligations issued by states or political subdivisions or authorities of states municipal bonds are typically designated as general obligation bonds which are general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity or revenue bonds which are payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes municipal bonds are longterm fixed rate debt obligations that generally decline in value with increases in interest rates when an issuers financial condition worsens or when the rating on a bond is decreased many municipal bonds may be called or redeemed prior to their stated maturity an event which is more likely to occur when interest rates fall in such an occurrence you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive in other bonds that have as high a yield or as long a maturity the market for municipal bonds is generally less liquid than for other securities and therefore the price of municipal bonds may be more volatile and subject to greater price fluctuations than securities with greater liquidity in addition an issuers ability to make income distributions generally depends on several factors including the financial condition of the issuer and general economic conditions any of these factors may negatively impact the price of municipal bonds held by the trust and would therefore impact the price of both the securities and the units the current economic downturn is negatively affecting towns counties and school districts across the nation in recognition of this fact moodys recently assigned a negative outlook to the creditworthiness of all local governments in the united states acts of terrorism and any resulting damage may not be covered by insurance on the bonds issuers of the bonds may therefore be at risk of default due to losses sustained as a result of terrorist activities build america bonds most of the securities in the trust are build america bonds the build america bonds market is smaller and less diverse than the broader municipal securities market in addition because babs are a new form of municipal financing and because bonds issued after december   will not qualify as babs it is difficult to predict the extent to which a market for such bonds will develop meaning that babs may experience greater illiquidity than other types of municipal securities because issuers of direct pay babs held in the trust receive reimbursement from the us treasury with respect to interest payments on the bonds there is a risk that those municipal issuers will not receive timely payment from the us treasury and may remain obligated to pay the full interest due on direct pay babs held by the trust furthermore it is possible that a municipal issuer may fail to comply with the requirements to receive the direct pay subsidy or that a future congress may terminate the subsidy altogether in addition the internal revenue code contains a general offset rule the irs offset rule which allows for the possibility that the subsidy payments received by issuers of the babs may be subject to offset against amounts owed by them to the federal government moreover the internal revenue service irs may audit the agencies issuing babs and such audits may among other things examine the price at which babs are initially sold to investors if the irs concludes that a build america bond was mispriced based on its audit it could disallow a portion or all of the interest subsidy received by the issuer of the build america bond the irs offset rule and the disallowance of any interest subsidy as a result of an irs audit could potentially adversely affect a babs issuers credit rating and adversely affect the issuers ability to repay or refinance babs this in turn could adversely affect the ratings and value of the babs held by the trust and the value of the trusts units and could impair the issues ability to make scheduled interest payments because the babs program is new certain aspects of the babs program may be subject to additional federal or state level guidance or subsequent legislation for example the irs or us treasury could impose restriction or limitations on the payments received aspects of the babs program for which the irs and us treasury have solicited public comment include but have not been limited to methods for making direct payments to issuers the tax procedural framework for such payments and compliance safeguards it is not known what additional procedures will be implemented with respect to direct pay babs if any nor is it known what effect such possible procedures would have on the babs market insurance risk certain of the securities in the trust are covered by insurance policies obtained by the issuers or underwriters of the bonds from insurance companies the schedule of investments identifies the insurer of each security insurance guarantees the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the insured securities such insurance is effective so long as the insured security is outstanding and the insurer remains in business insurance relates only to the particular security and not to the units offered hereby or to their market value insured securities have received the rating described in the schedule of investments by standard  poors in recognition of such insurance there can be no assurance that any insurer listed will be able to satisfy its commitments in the event claims are made in the future certain significant providers of insurance for municipal page  securities have recently incurred significant losses as a result of exposure to subprime mortgages and other lower credit quality investments that have experienced recent defaults or otherwise suffered extreme credit deterioration as a result such losses have reduced the insurers capital and called into question their continued ability to perform their obligations under such insurance if they are called upon to do so in the future while an insured municipal security will typically be deemed to have the rating of its insurer if the insurer of a municipal security suffers a downgrade in its credit rating or the market discounts the value of the insurance provided by the insurer the rating of the underlying municipal security will be more relevant and the value of the municipal security would more closely if not entirely reflect such rating in such a case the value of insurance associated with a municipal security would decline and may not add any value insurance companies are subject to extensive regulation and supervision where they do business by state insurance commissioners who regulate the standards of solvency which must be maintained the nature of and limitations on investments reports of financial condition and requirements regarding reserves for unearned premiums losses and other matters a significant portion of the assets of insurance companies is required by law to be held in reserve against potential claims on policies and is not available to general creditors although the federal government does not regulate the business of insurance federal initiatives including pension regulation controls on medical care costs minimum standards for nofault automobile insurance national health insurance tax law changes affecting life insurance companies and repeal of the antitrust exemption for the insurance business can significantly impact the insurance business because the insurance on the securities if any will be effective so long as the securities are outstanding such insurance will be taken into account in determining the market value of the securities and therefore some value attributable to such insurance will be included in the value of the units of the trust the insurance does not however guarantee the market value of the securities or of the units discount bonds discount bonds are bonds which have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type the market discount on previously issued bonds will increase when interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase and decrease when such interest rates fall other things being equal original issue discount bonds  of the securities are considered original issue discount bonds these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value under current law the original issue discount which is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the bonds is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxable interest income for federal income tax purposes unit holders may receive ordinary income dividends from the trust if the trust sells or redeems bonds that were acquired at a market discount or sells bonds at a short term capital gain in general the internal revenue service will treat bonds as market discount bonds when the cost of the bond plus any original issue discount that has not yet accrued is less than the amount due to be paid at the maturity of the bond any gain realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is attributable to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income the current value of an original issue discount bond reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at maturity in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value premium bonds premium bonds are bonds which have been acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the premium bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the trust were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type the current returns of such bonds are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemptions are more likely to page  occur at times when the bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value to the extent that the securities were deposited in the fund at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed this will represent a loss of capital when compared to the original public offering price of the units the trust may be required to sell zero coupon bonds prior to maturity at their current market price which is likely to be less than their par value in order to pay expenses of the trust or in case the trust is terminated see removing securities from the trust and amending or terminating the indenture legislationlitigation from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed which may have a negative impact on the prices of certain of the municipal bonds represented in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the municipal bonds such as litigation affecting the validity of certain municipal bonds or the qualification of bonds as build america bonds eligible for a federal subsidy payment may negatively impact the value of these securities we cannot predict what impact any pending or proposed legislation or pending or threatened litigation will have on the value of the securities or on the issuers public offering the public offering price you may buy units at the public offering price the price per unit of which is comprised of the following  the aggregate underlying value of the securities  the amount of any cash in the interest and principal accounts of the trust  net interest accrued but unpaid on the securities after the first settlement date to the date of settlement and  the sales charge the price you pay for your units will differ from the amount stated under summary of essential information due to various factors including fluctuations in the prices of the securities changes in the value of the interest andor principal accounts and the accrual of interest on the securities although you are not required to pay for your units until three business days

shorter time period than the life of the trust to the extent actual organization costs are less than the estimated amount only the actual organization costs will be deducted from the assets of the trust accrued interest accrued interest represents unpaid interest on a bond from the last day it paid interest interest on the securities generally is paid semiannually although the trust accrues such interest daily because the trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected the public offering price of units will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement you will receive the amount if any of accrued interest you paid for on the next distribution date in addition if you sell or redeem your units you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of accrued interest from the purchaser of your units minimum purchase the minimum amount you can purchase of the trust is generally  worth of units  if you are purchasing units for your individual retirement account or any other qualified retirement plan but such amounts may vary depending on your selling firm sales charges initial offering period the maximum sales charge during the initial offering period equals  of the public offering price equivalent to  of the net amount invested secondary market the maximum sales charge during the secondary market is determined based upon the number of years remaining to the maturity of each security in the trust but in no event will the secondary market sales charge exceed  of the public offering price equivalent to  of the net amount invested for purposes of computation securities will be deemed to mature either on their expressed maturity dates or an earlier date if a they have been called for redemption

status the trust will be audited annually so long as we are making a secondary market for units we will bear the cost of these annual audits to the extent the cost exceeds  per unit otherwise the trust will pay for the audit you may request a copy of the audited financial statements from the trustee tax status federal tax matters this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service irs could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status the trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company commonly known as a ric under the federal tax laws if the trust page  qualifies as a ric and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes for federal income tax purposes you are treated as the owner of trust units and not of the assets held by the trust taxability issues are taken into account at the trust level your federal income tax treatment of income from the trust is based on the distributions paid by the trust income from the trust trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates the trusts distributions into ordinary dividends capital gains dividends and returns of capital income reported is generally net of expenses but see deductibility of trust expenses below ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from the trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from the trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from the trust may also be subject to a new  medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units for units purchased on or after january   or  if the units are acquired in a reinvestment plan in  the information statement you receive in regard to the sale or redemption of your units may contain information about your basis in the units and whether any gain or loss recognized by you should be considered long term or short term capital gain the information reported to you is based upon rules that do not take into consideration all facts that may be known to you or your advisors you should consult with your tax advisors about any adjustments that may need to be made to the information reported to you capital gains and losses if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  for net capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years and the  rate is reduced to  for net capital gains from most property regardless of when acquired with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from the trust and sell your units at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as long term capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by the trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of page  these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which the trust properly reports as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below however distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly reported by such trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met in the case of dividends with respect to taxable years of the trust beginning prior to  distributions from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as an interestrelated dividend attributable to certain interest income received by the trust or as a shortterm capital gain dividend attributable to certain net shortterm capital gain income received by the trust may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes when received by certain foreign investors provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met distributions after december   may be subject to a us withholding tax of  in the case of distributions to i certain non us financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the us treasury to collect and disclose certain information and ii certain other nonus entities that do not provide certain certifications and information about the entitys us owners you should consult your

servicing agent if you hold ftps units or advisor direct or the trustee if you hold advisor direct units unit holder reports the trustee will prepare a statement detailing the per unit amounts if any distributed from the interest account and principal account in connection with each distribution in addition at the end of each calendar year the trustee will prepare a statement which contains the following information  a summary of transactions in the trust for the year  a list of any securities sold during the year and the securities held at the end of that year by the trust  the redemption price per unit computed on the st day of december of such year or the last business day before and  amounts of income and capital distributed during the year it is the responsibility of the entity through which you hold your units to distribute these statements to you in addition you may also request from the trustee copies of the evaluations of the securities as prepared by the evaluator to enable you to comply with applicable federal and state tax reporting requirements interest and principal distributions you will begin receiving distributions on your units only after you become a record owner the trustee will credit interest received on the trusts securities to the interest account of the trust all other receipts such as return of capital or capital gain dividends are credited to the principal account of the trust after deducting the amount of accrued interest the trustee advanced to us as unit holder of record as of the first settlement date the trustee will distribute an amount substantially equal to your pro rata share of the balance of the interest account calculated on the basis of one twelfth of the estimated annual amount of interest received in the interest account after deducting estimated expenses on or near the distribution dates to unit holders of record on the preceding distribution record date see summary of essential information for the trust because interest is not received by the trust at a constant rate throughout the year the distributions you receive may be more or less than the amount credited to the interest account as of the distribution record date in order to minimize fluctuations in distributions the page  trustee is authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary to provide distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee will be reimbursed without interest for any such advances from funds in the interest account at the next distribution record date the trustee will distribute amounts in the principal account on the twentyfifth day of each month to unit holders of record on the tenth day of each month provided the amount equals at least  per unit however amounts in the principal account from the sale of securities designated to meet redemptions of units or pay expenses will not be distributed in any case the trustee will distribute any funds in the principal account in december of each year and as part of the final liquidation distribution if the trustee does not have your tin it is required to withhold a certain percentage of your distribution and deliver such amount to the irs you may recover this amount by giving your tin to the trustee or when you file a tax return however you should check your statements to make sure the trustee has your tin to avoid this backup withholding within a reasonable time after the trust is terminated you will receive the pro rata share of the money from the disposition of the securities the trustee may establish reserves the reserve account within the trust to cover anticipated state and local taxes or any governmental charges to be paid out of the trust redeeming your units you may redeem all or a portion of your units at any time by sending a request for redemption to your brokerdealer or bank through which you hold your units or to the ftps unit servicing agent if you hold ftps units or advisor direct if you hold advisor direct units no redemption fee will be charged but you are responsible for any governmental charges that apply certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction fee for processing redemption requests three business days after the day you tender your units the date of tender you will receive cash in an amount for each unit equal to the redemption price per unit calculated at the evaluation time on the date of tender the date of tender is considered to be the date on which your redemption request is received by the trustee from the brokerdealer or bank through which you hold your units or if you hold ftps units the date the redemption request is received by the ftps servicing agent or if you hold advisor direct units the date the redemption request is received either by advisor direct or the trustee as applicable if such day is a day the nyse is open for trading however if the redemption request is received after  pm eastern time or after any earlier closing time on a day on which the nyse is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time the date of tender is the next day the nyse is open for trading any amounts paid on redemption representing interest will be withdrawn from the interest account if funds are available for that purpose or from the principal account all other amounts paid on redemption will be taken from the principal account the irs will require the trustee to withhold a portion of your redemption proceeds if the trustee does not have your tin as generally discussed under interest and principal distributions the trustee may sell securities in the trust to make funds available for redemption if securities are sold the size and diversification of the trust will be reduced these sales may result in lower prices than if the securities were sold at a different time your right to redeem units and therefore your right to receive payment may be delayed  if the nyse is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings  if the sec determines that trading on the nyse is restricted or that an emergency exists making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practical or  for any other period permitted by sec order the trustee is not liable to any person for any loss or damage which may result from such a suspension or postponement the redemption price the redemption price per unit is determined by the trustee by adding  cash in the interest and principal accounts of the trust not designated to purchase securities  the aggregate underlying value of the securities held in the trust and  accrued interest on the securities and deducting  any applicable taxes or governmental charges that need to be paid out of the trust  any amounts owed to the trustee for its advances  estimated accrued expenses of the trust if any  cash held for distribution to unit holders of record of the trust as of the business day before the evaluation being made and  other liabilities incurred by the trust and page  dividing  the result by the number of outstanding units of the trust until the end of the initial offering period the redemption price per unit will include estimated organization costs as set forth under fee table removing securities from the trust the portfolio of the trust is not managed however we may but are not required to direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain limited circumstances including situations in which  the issuer of the security has defaulted in the payment of principal or interest on the security  any action or proceeding seeking to restrain or enjoin the payment of principal or interest on the security has been instituted  there is any legal question or impediment affecting the security  the issuer of the security has breached a covenant which would affect the payment of principal or interest on the security the issuers credit standing or otherwise damage the sound investment character of the security  the issuer has defaulted on the payment of any other of its outstanding obligations  the security is the subject of an advanced refunding  the sale of securities is necessary or advisable i in order to maintain the qualification of the trust as a regulated investment company or ii to provide funds to make any distribution for a taxable year in order to avoid imposition of any income or excise taxes on undistributed income in the trust  such factors arise which in our opinion adversely affect the tax or exchange control status of the security  the price of the security has declined to such an extent or such other credit factors exist that in our opinion keeping the security would be harmful to the trust or  the sale of the security is necessary for the trust to comply with such federal andor state securities laws regulations andor regulatory actions and interpretations which may be in effect from time to time if a security defaults in the payment of principal or interest and no provision for payment is made the trustee must notify us of this fact if we fail to instruct the trustee whether to sell or hold the security within  days of our being notified the trustee may in its discretion sell any defaulted securities and will not be liable for any depreciation or loss incurred thereby except for instances in which the trust acquires replacement securities as described in the first trust combined series the trust will generally not acquire any bonds or other property other than the securities the trustee on behalf of the trust and at the direction of the sponsor will vote for or against any offer for new or exchanged bonds or property in exchange for a security in that regard we may instruct the trustee to accept such an offer or to take any other action with respect thereto as we may deem proper if the issuer is in default with respect to such securities or in our written opinion the issuer will likely default in respect to such securities in the foreseeable future any obligations received in exchange or substitution will be held by the trustee subject to the terms and conditions in the indenture to the same extent as securities originally deposited in the trust we may get advice from the portfolio supervisor before reaching a decision regarding the receipt of new or exchange securities or property the trustee may retain and pay us or an affiliate of ours to act as agent for the trust to facilitate selling securities exchanged bonds or property from the trust if we or our affiliate act in this capacity we will be held subject to the restrictions under the  act the trustee may sell securities designated by us or absent our direction at its own discretion in order to meet redemption requests or pay expenses we will maintain a list with the trustee of which securities should be sold we may consider sales of units of unit investment trusts which we sponsor in making recommendations to the trustee on the selection of brokerdealers to execute the trusts portfolio transactions or when acting as agent for the trust in acquiring or selling securities on behalf of the trust amending or terminating the indenture amendments the indenture may be amended by us and the trustee without your consent  to cure ambiguities  to correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision  to make any amendment required by any governmental agency or  to make other changes determined not to be adverse to your best interests as determined by us and the trustee page  termination as provided by the indenture the trust will terminate upon the redemption sale or other disposition of the last security held in the trust but in no case later than the termination date as stated in the summary of essential information the trust may be terminated prior to the termination date  upon the consent of  of the unit holders of the trust  if the value of the securities owned by the trust as shown by any evaluation is less than  of the aggregate principal amount of securities deposited in the trust during the initial offering period discretionary liquidation amount or  in the event that units of the trust not yet sold aggregating more than  of the units of such trust are tendered for redemption by underwriters including the sponsor if the trust is terminated due to this last reason we will refund your entire sales charge for various reasons the trust may be reduced below the discretionary liquidation amount and could therefore be terminated before the termination date the trustee will notify you of any termination prior to the termination date you will receive a cash distribution from the sale of the remaining securities along with your interest in the interest and principal accounts of the trust within a reasonable time after the trust is terminated the sale of securities upon termination may result in a lower sales price than might otherwise be realized if the sale were not required at that time for this reason among others the amount realized by a unit holder upon termination may be less than the principal amount of securities per unit or value at the time of purchase the trustee will deduct from the trust any accrued costs expenses advances or indemnities provided for by the indenture including estimated compensation of the trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to pay any taxes or other governmental charges

the sponsor you will receive free of charge supplemental information about this series which has been filed with the sec and to which we have referred throughout this information states more specific risk information about the trust description of bond ratings  as published by standard  poors standard  poors a standard  poors issue credit rating is a forwardlooking opinion about the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program including ratings on mediumterm note programs and commercial paper programs it takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the opinion reflects standard  page  poors view of the obligors capacity and willingness to meet its financial commitments as they come due and may assess terms such as collateral security and subordination which could affect ultimate payment in the event of default issue credit ratings can be either longterm or shortterm shortterm ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered short term in the relevant market in the united states for example that means obligations with an original maturity of no more than  days including commercial paper shortterm ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to put features on long term obligations the result is a dual rating in which the shortterm rating addresses the put feature in addition to the usual longterm rating mediumterm notes are assigned longterm ratings longterm issue credit ratings issue credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations  likelihood of payment capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation  nature of and provisions of the obligation  protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights the issue rating definitions are an assessment of default risk but may incorporate an assessment of relative seniority or ultimate recovery in the event of default junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation may apply when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations aaa an obligation rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aa an obligation rated aa differs from the highest rated obligations only in small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong a an obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbb an obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation obligations rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions bb an obligation rated bb is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation b an obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated bb but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligors capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation ccc an obligation rated ccc is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation cc an obligation rated cc is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment c a c rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment obligations that have payment arrearages allowed by the terms of the documents or obligations of an issuer that is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not experienced a payment default among others the c rating may be assigned to subordinated debt preferred stock or other obligations on which cash payments have been suspended in accordance with the instruments terms or when preferred stock is the subject of a distressed exchange offer whereby some or all of the issue is either page  repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par d an obligation rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poors believes that such payments will be made during such grade period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized an obligations rating is lowered to d upon completion of a distressed exchange offer whereby some or all of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par plus or minus the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories expected ratings are designated on the schedule of investments by an e after the rating code expected ratings are intended to anticipate sps forthcoming rating assignments expected ratings are generated by bloomberg based on sources it considers

participation in leasepurchase obligations of certain states or united states territories the trust is therefore susceptible to general or particular economic political or regulatory factors that may affect issuers of such obligations the following information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the many complex factors that may have an effect the information does not apply to conduit obligations on which the public issuer itself has no financial responsibility this information is derived from official statements of certain national issuers published in connection with their issuance of securities and from other publicly available information and is believed to be accurate no independent verification has been made of any of the following information the timely payment of principal of and interest on certain of the securities may be guaranteed by bond insurance purchased by certain of the issuers or other parties insurance risk certain of the bonds in the trust are insured in the case of insured bonds insurance has been obtained either by the issuer of bonds in the trust by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds in the trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of such bonds in the trust the premium for any preinsured bond insurance has been paid by such issuer by a prior owner of such bonds or the sponsor and any such policy or policies are noncancellable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the respective preinsured bond insurer remains in business if the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claimspaying ability of any such insurer deteriorates the insurers have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described events page  in order to be in an insured trust bonds must be insured by an insurer in determining eligibility for insurance insurers have applied their own standards which correspond generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the insurability of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the criteria used in the selection of bonds by the sponsor to the extent the standards of the insurers are more restrictive than those of the sponsor the previously stated trust investment criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds this decision is made prior to the date of deposit as debt obligations not eligible for insurance are not deposited in an insured trust thus all of the bonds in the portfolios of the insured trusts are insured by the issuer of the bonds by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds in a trust in the event of nonpayment of interest or principal when due in respect of a bond an insurer shall make such payment after the respective insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened but not earlier than the date such payment is due the insurer as regards any payment it may make will succeed to the rights of the trustee in respect thereof all policies issued by the insurers are substantially identical insofar as obligations to an insured trust are concerned each insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business such regulation however is no guarantee that each insurer will be able to perform on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made thereunder at some time in the future at the date hereof it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the insurers which would materially impair the ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio insurance there have been a number of recent developments with respect to ratings actions impacting insurance companies by the rating agencies standard  poors ratings group a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc sp moodys investors service inc moodys and fitch ratings ltd fitch in light of the ongoing nature of ratings actions or announcements by the rating agencies you should consult announcements by the rating agencies the websites of the rating agencies and the websites of the insurers for the then current publicly available information these ratings actions have had a significant impact on the ability of insurers to compete in the financial guarantee business municipal securities certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity other bonds in the funds may be revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in the funds both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors a description of certain types of revenue bonds follows healthcare revenue securities certain of the bonds may be healthcare revenue bonds ratings of bonds issued for healthcare facilities are sometimes based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other hospitals efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs pursuant to recent federal legislation medicare reimbursements are currently calculated on a prospective basis utilizing a single nationwide schedule of rates prior to such legislation medicare reimbursements were based on the actual costs incurred by the health facility the current legislation may adversely affect reimbursements to hospitals and other facilities for services provided under the medicare program multifamily mortgage revenue securities certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from housing projects for low to moderate income families the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments will be affected by events and conditions affecting financed projects including among other things the achievement and maintenance of sufficient occupancy levels and adequate rental income increases in taxes employment and income conditions prevailing in local labor markets utility costs and other page  operating expenses the managerial ability of project managers changes in laws and governmental regulations the appropriation of subsidies and social and economic trends affecting the localities in which the projects are located the occupancy of housing projects may be adversely affected by high rent levels and income limitations imposed under federal and state programs multifamily mortgage revenue bonds are subject to redemption and call features including extraordinary mandatory redemption features upon prepayment sale or nonorigination of mortgage loans as well as upon the occurrence of other events certain issuers of multifamily housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds in one situation the new york city housing development corporation in reliance on its interpretation of certain language in the indenture under which one of its bond issues was created redeemed all of such issue at par in spite of the fact that such indenture provided that the first optional redemption was to include a premium over par and could not occur prior to  water and sewerage revenue securities certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services water and sewerage bonds are generally payable from user fees problems faced by such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees utility revenue securities certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of energy utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility commissions which among other things establish the rates which may be charged and the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base the problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the governing public utility commission the difficulty in financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations increased competition recent reductions in estimates of future demand for electricity in certain areas of the country the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing legislation and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of such bonds to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds lease obligation revenue securities certain of the bonds may be lease obligations issued for the most part by governmental authorities that have no taxing power or other means of directly raising revenues rather the governmental authorities are financing vehicles created solely for the construction of buildings schools administrative offices convention centers and prisons for example or the purchase of equipment police cars and computer systems for example that will be used by a state or local government the lessee thus these obligations are subject to the ability and willingness of the lessee government to meet its lease rental payments which include debt service on the obligations lease obligations are subject in almost all cases to the annual appropriation risk ie the lessee government is not legally obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments beyond the current fiscal year these obligations are also subject to construction and abatement risk in many statesrental obligations cease in the event that delays in building damage destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use by the lessee in these cases insurance provisions designed to alleviate this risk become important credit factors in the event of default by the lessee government there may be significant legal andor practical difficulties involved in the reletting or sale of the project some of these issues particularly those for equipment purchase contain the socalled substitution safeguard which bars the lessee government in the event it defaults on its rental payments from the purchase or use of similar equipment for a certain period of time this safeguard is designed to insure that the lessee government will appropriate even though it is not legally obligated to do so but its legality remains untested in most if not all states industrial revenue securities certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds irbs including pollution control revenue bonds which are taxable or taxexempt securities issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various industrial projects these projects are usually operated by corporate entities issuers are obligated only to pay amounts due on the irbs to the extent that funds are available page  from the unexpended proceeds of the irbs or receipts or revenues of the issuer under an arrangement between the issuer and the corporate operator of a project the arrangement may be in the form of a lease installment sale agreement conditional sale agreement or loan agreement but in each case the payments to the issuer are designed to be sufficient to meet the payments of amounts due on the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a complete restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or affected the irbs in a fund may be subject to special or extraordinary redemption provisions which may provide for redemption at par or with respect to original issue discount bonds at issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to the redemption date plus if applicable a premium the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of irbs or other bonds in the funds prior to the stated maturity of such bonds transportation facility revenue securities certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements the air transport industry is experiencing significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints and other factors and several airlines are experiencing severe financial difficulties the sponsor cannot predict what effect these industry conditions may have on airport revenues which are dependent for payment on the financial condition of the airlines and their usage of the particular airport facility similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents education revenue securities certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds in the trusts general problems relating to college and university obligations would include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and new government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees resource recovery facility revenue securities certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities the sponsor cannot page  predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in the funds prior to the stated maturity of the securities discount securities certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the funds were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase the market discount of previously issued bonds will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium bonds and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount bonds will be reduced market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds original issue discount securities certain of the bonds are considered original issue discount bonds under current law the original issue discount which is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the bonds is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxable interest income for federal income tax purposes on sale or redemption any gain realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is attributable to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income the current value of an original issue discount bond reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at maturity the market value tends to increase in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity when issued securities when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to the trust when the bonds are actually issued delivery of these securities may be delayed or may not occur interest on these securities does not begin accruing to the trust until the sponsor delivers them to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these securities after their expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the securities to the trust this could lower your first year estimated current return in addition you may experience gains or losses on these securities from the time you purchase units even though the trust has not received them zero coupon securities zero coupon bonds which include bonds known as multiplier bonds money multiplier bonds capital appreciation bonds capital accumulator bonds compound interest bonds and money discount maturity payment bonds do not provide for the payment of any current interest and generally provide for payment at maturity at face value unless sooner sold or redeemed zero coupon bonds may be subject to more price volatility than conventional bonds while some types of zero coupon bonds such as multipliers and capital appreciation bonds define par as the initial offering price rather than the maturity value they share the basic zero coupon bond features of  not paying interest on a semiannual basis and  providing for the reinvestment of the bonds semiannual earnings at the bonds stated yield to maturity while zero coupon bonds are frequently marketed on the basis that their fixed rate of return minimizes reinvestment risk this benefit can be negated in large part by weak call protection ie a bonds provision for redemption at only a modest premium over the accreted value of the bond premium securities certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the premium bonds at the time they were purchased by the fund were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable bonds decrease the market premium of previously issued bonds will be increased and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase the market premium of previously issued bonds will be reduced other things being equal the current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at page  times when the redeemed bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value special tax securities certain of the bonds may be special tax bonds payable from and secured by the revenues derived by a municipality from a particular tax examples of special taxes are a tax on the rental of a hotel room on the purchase of food and beverages on the purchase of fuel on the rental of automobiles or on the consumption of liquor special tax bonds are not secured by the general tax revenues of the municipality and they do not represent general obligations of the municipality payment on special tax bonds may be adversely affected by a reduction in revenues realized from the underlying special tax also should spending on the particular goods or services that are subject to the special tax decline the municipality may be under no obligation to increase the rate of the special tax to ensure that sufficient revenues are raised from the shrinking taxable base tax allocation securities certain of the bonds may be tax allocation bonds tax allocation bonds are typically secured by incremental tax revenues collected on property within the areas where redevelopment projects financed by bond proceeds are located bond payments are expected to be made from projected increases in tax revenues derived from higher assessed values of property resulting from development in the particular project area and not from an increase in tax rates special risk considerations include variations in taxable values of property in the project area successful appeals by property owners of assessed valuations substantial delinquencies in the payment of property taxes or imposition of any constitutional or legislative property tax rate decrease page
