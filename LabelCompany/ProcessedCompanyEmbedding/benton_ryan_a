presented as discontinued operations unless otherwise indicated financial results discussed during this call exclude the discontinued operation we will utilize todays time with a presentation hosted by ryan benton our ceo james lougheed our senior vice president of worldwide sales and marketing and myself followed by questionandanswer session and with that id like to turn the call over to our ceo ryan benton ryan ryan benton thank you about a year ago we had a vision of a better exar we became determined to transform exar into that vision the first part of the transformation was the recognition that we needed to define with extraordinary precision our areas of competence and redeploy assets that either did not fit that vision or were under utilized of course we have done this most notably when we announced the sale of the iml consumer display business although the business has been and continues to be profitable a consumer business of this nature did not fit our strategy this transaction is under regulatory review and we believe it’s still on track to be closed by the end of the calendar year as i said previously the biggest challenge to this transaction is that exar loses and the buyer gains an incredibly talented team over the last few months weve started hiring in earnest in order to fill the gaps this transaction will create during the quarter we also closed the sale leaseback of our fremont campus netting  million in cash our total cash balance grew  million during the first quarter to  million and reached over  million a little over a week ago the second area of transformation has been the reinvention of the supply chain in china where we have found that costs are lower ive said many times that this is the equivalent of discovering that water is wet or the sky is blue my point is that this is pretty obvious stuff what we have done though most notably is execute extremely well keith will expand on the success that we are having and how this continues to exceed our expectations the third area of transformation has been in sales and marketing where we concluded that if we wanted to realize our vision we needed to do something different fortunately for us industry consolidation cracked the door open for a company like exar to reinvent ourselves rather than the build it and hope they will come strategy we saw an opening to leverage our team capabilities to be responsive to tier  customers who are increasingly frustrated with the lack of competition and whose requirements are increasingly ignored so we didn’t have to change our gotomarket strategy to focus our resources on winning quality sockets for tier  customers we have limited resources so weve had to make smart choices we are now winning socket that can be replicated with other tier  accounts and can be leveraged into our horizontal channel in sales and marketing we also recognized that we simply had to execute better since james took over sales we have attracted seasoned top talent to augment to core employee provide a sales incentive plan and implemented improved systems and processes yes we are the beneficiary indiscernible with the industry consolidation however the real story is that the sales team has evolved to where they go into tier  accounts and expect to win and the sales team is supported by a technology team that is answering the bell and turning some impressive silicon in a short deadline james will talk in a few minutes about this evolution and finally we are transforming exar by changing the culture we are installing a culture that is responsive to the customer and has a passion for winning we are becoming an exar where internally we expect to win and externally when we do hopefully people arent surprised this takes me to slide  exars core business and the iml business which we are divesting both performed extremely well this quarter the combined  million from nongaap operating income was a company record which is significant for a company that was founded in  this is an achievement that the team should take considerable pride in its also worth noting that this translated to  nongaap eps a few quarters ago  eps was our target model including iml we wont break an arm indiscernible ourselves but it is nice to be able to say that we hit the target the most important part of the slide though is that it highlights how the  million in nongaap operating income from exars continuing operation for q stacks up from a wide indiscernible they teams stayed focused and did a fantastic job executing this quarter although there are plenty of challenges and plenty of work left to do we have transformed the company into a sustainable analog mixed signal company with the solid foundation that we can build upon when we announced the sale of our iml i think it raised more than a few eyebrows when we maintained the target model of  eps without iml as james and keith provide further color i think youll start to understand why we are optimistic about our prospects to hit the target model ill now hand the presentation over to keith to discuss the first quarter financial results in greater detail as well as guidance for the second quarter followed by james to give a more indepth sales and marketing and general business update in the end ill give few final thoughts and in doing so strive to improve on a whole gravity thing keith keith tainsky thank you ryan our q revenue was at the high end of the guidance range at  million ill discuss that in more detail on the next slide on this slide we are simply trying to give the demographics of the revenue from continuing operations as these figures now exclude the iml display business which is being divested the iml business is largely in china so continuing operations now has more geographic diversity asia is now  americas  and europe  we will continue to leverage our broad horizontal channel however one benefit of our tier  strategy is that well have the opportunity to take more business direct when it makes sense to do so now lets turn to the full financial highlights in summary it was an excellent quarter as the last slide showed revenue was up  sequentially at the high end of our guidance range this increase was driven by three main factors the additional th week increasing advance product sales and a seasonal rebound from chinese new year as ryan has highlighted increased sales were offset by an inventory burn in the channel as we simply allowed distributors to follow normal ordering patterns from a top line perspective we are also encouraged by the strengthening demand for our products as evidenced by over  million of total backlog in the quarter and most encouraging metric i can see though is that the sellthrough on a per week basis which normalizes for the th week is up for the third consecutive quarter and we see momentum heading into q in addition to the revenue being at the high end of the range gross margin came in at  this was above the high end of the  to  range and  basis points higher than last quarter and also now clearly within reach of our target model of  the margin improvement was a combination of better mix of advanced product sales as well as continued progress in our cost of goods reductions both of which we will cover in greater detail on later slides as for operating expenses there was  decrease which was positively impacted by restructuring that was completed in april the net result of  million operating income and earning per share of  were both towards the high end of our guidance as a point of reference it is noteworthy that through increased sales expanding margins and lower opex the  we posted this quarter for exars continuing operations is equivalent to the previous quarter results including iml for the second quarter we expect revenue to be flat to up  or between  million to  million although we have the headwind of comparing against  weeks next quarter in addition to a leaner channel we see sell through per week growing sufficiently such that we still expect to have modest growth as for margin we expect the margin to stay in the  to  range operating expenses are expected to be slightly higher next quarter while there is a natural reduction from  to  weeks this is offset as a result of higher salaries and wages attributable to our annual merit process as well as expenses related to new hires netnet we see earnings per diluted share of  to  now lets look at the cost of goods reductions and the impact advanced part sales are having on our margin trajectory simply put our margin trajectory showed the result of lot of focused effort and the results of our strategy to create an operational center of excellence in china by the end of our september quarter we should have a fully staffed high quality team in shanghai in a new office and with a new logistics hub to improve cycle time and lower cost even more this is a never ending improvement process however the team has now reached a clear point of sustainability that being said the result of cost savings to date continues to exceed our expectations in q  we said we had a target to get to  million per quarter out of our cost to goods solid within fiscal  we achieved that mark within one quarter last quarter we laid out an additional goal of incremental  million per quarter in targeted savings to also be realized by march  i am pleased to report that in one quarter end we are already close to realizing that goal as well having achieving another  during q it is becoming pretty apparent in next quarter we all need to publish a new goal cost of goods reductions are only part of the margin story focus and progress on advanced product scales will be other part james will elaborate but the funnels quality design win is growing and as a result the visible impact on margin is becoming clear in q  we saw a substantial increase in sales of advanced products which carry higher than corporate average gross margin advanced product sales increased sequentially by  million to  million in q this is a tremendous achievement by the sales and marketing teams and with that i want to turn it over to james james james lougheed all right thanks keith so as mentioned our total sales grew  quarteronquarter in line with their longerterm goal of hitting  million by q of fiscal year  the growth was driven by our industrial business growing  quarteronquarter the main drivers of that growth were advanced product sales for our new power and interface products and as mentioned by keith we also had tier win from the th week and the chinese new year rebound this was somewhat offset by continued inventory burn in the channel infrastructure was slightly down impacted by heavy decline in some legacy telecom product sales but largely offset by heavy growth in our dcs inscription and compression products with the focus on continued operations and therefore move away from consumer we wanted to showcase two more end markets that we feel will make sense to give more visibility on both of these markets have different product requirements and the different customer culture to that of the main industrial customer base firstly audiovideo this includes a video processor business as well as a broad range of power interface and analog products that we sell into applications such as video surveillance teleconferencing systems digital homes wireless microphone systems professional audio and broadcast this business represents about  of our revenue was down moderately quarteronquarter due to the nature of the video processor business revenue in this end market tends to be quite lumpy and secondly automotive exar has played in the automotive after market space for many years today it makes up  of our total business selling into applications such as bluetooth audio systems infotainment off road vehicles black box systems and automotive diagnostic equipment the automotive market is a great fit for our new strategy of serving tier  accounts currently being underserved by competitors we have various technologies that can be leveraged in this space our first aecq family of products should complete qualification by the end of this year we expect this end market to grow for us considerably over the next few years as i mentioned on previous calls about a year ago we redirected our sales force to focus on what we call advanced products these are world class analog mixedsignal products that generate margins significantly north of the company of average these are products designed in recent years and what are new product engine is laser focused on i don’t think its coincidence that our sales organization knew that in fiscal year  the size of their paycheck is going to be directly related to how much advanced product sales were achieved so this slide i like to call cause an effect this is the result of advanced product designed wins at tier  customers as they start to ramp these are the wins i have been alluding to on previous calls now this large growth in advanced product sales comes from multiple areas our lighting business grew nicely quarteronquarter as we now take a leadership position in the download market our digital power universal pmic family saw a record quarter with growth in tier  teleconferencing and point of sale systems our usb ur products continue to grow in the switch and router market and our pci express uarts and multi protocol transceivers grew strongly with tier  in the industrial pc and iit getaway space now on a previous call i mentioned a shift of focus for our dcs inscription and compression products away from the secondary hard disk drive storage market and towards the primary solid state drive storage market where our low lengthy solutions are much better fit in q our tier  design win grew significantly in this space and as you can see by the margin outlined this increase has directly contributed to the gross margin increase as ryan and keith previously pointed out now ill give flavor some new mostly advanced product released during the first quarter the xr is a multi protocol transceiver with the industries widest output swing design for multiple tier  in the pc and iot gateways space the xr is a high speed rs transceiver with the industries lowest power down shut down mode designed specifically for a tier  networking customers the sp is a standard rs serial transceiver customized in a small package for a tier  point of sales customers this is a great example of showing our responsiveness to the needs of tier  the xr are  volt  and  amp power modules with market leading efficiency designed for a tier  infrastructure customers as well as multiple joint customers the xr are  volt  and  amp power modules with market leading power density and designed for a tier  industrial and tier  automotive customers the xr is a our first monolithic pmic leveraging expertise brought in by the iml acquisition and designed for multiple tier  industrial customers and a tier  automotive customers for an adas application the xr is a custom force touch afe for a tier  smartphone customers and the  is an eight channel version of award winning  channel force touch afe currently under design at multiple smartphone customers these are world class products serving tier  customers that will help drive our business toward our longterm goals and with that let me turn the call back over to ryan for his concluding remarks ryan benton thanks james thanks keith before we turn to questions let me simply lead you with our new mission statement we have committed our self to remain singly focused to our core competencies and be decisive in all areas that impact them we will continue to deliver exceptional value through focus on excellence and reliability and for those who you dont know thats what the exar name stands for as we create multiple centers of excellences in different parts of the world we will work as one global team with the passion for winning we will strive to be the most responsive analog and mixedsignal provider by nimbly leveraging our broad portfolio experience in ip to enable the world leading electronic manufacturers to connect and to power the next generation products now we will be happy to take your questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the lines of tore svanberg with stifel tore svanberg yes thank you and congratulation on the results a few questions you talked about the inventory adjustments in the channel obviously improving in the quarter but i was hoping you could also share with us sort of where we stand on the correction what do you think we would be completely done with at this quarter or we still have a little bit of overhang there james lougheed so tore this is james yes we had some inventory  channel inventory reduction over the past couple of quarters as we’ve talked about i think what we see is  we still may have some more of that play out we do have one large distributor who is looking to bring down their inventory we are happy with where the inventory levels are however if distributors want to increase with the health of that inventory as we go through this mix shift to more advanced products and less percentage of commodity and we got the growth to handle that and its not something we are actively changing or orchestrating ryan benton yes tore let me kind of add to that i referenced on the last call going into the th week that quite frankly we didnt know how it was going to play out and we just let people naturally continue to place the same order patterns and it ended being a significant burn but of course and as you can see from the number of the sell through was strong and actually continue to get stronger throughout the quarter so we are happy to see  we’re happy to see a leaner channel tore svanberg good i had a question on the advanced product so obviously grew tremendously in the quarter some of this tier  design wins is now ramping i mean was there something unusual about this quarter i guess what i am trying to get is should we expect these types of step ups every quarter and is that primarily what gives you the conviction that you can obviously go from  million to  million a quarter here fairly soon james lougheed well to answer the second question first yes i mean thats obviously whats being giving us the confidence that weve been able to see these coming down the pipeline thus giving us the confidence to put these numbers out there like  million by end of fiscal year  was there anything the question was there anything different in this particular quarter not really there was  we are working on multiple of these designs this is not as i went through the different product areas you can see this is not from one customer this is multiple customers is multiple product lines so it is sort of what weve been seeing in terms of us winning  tend to winning more design wins at our customers and those design wins tending to be larger but there is a double edged sword with the tier  where it can be a little more lumpy so we have some customers who will go to market build some product they might see how the market reacts to that product and they might go away and come back a little bit later so and then we have new products coming in that might fill that gap as well so its really this is the confidence level or this is the  it’s these design wins that are sort of behind the confidence level that we have to be able to show continued growth tore svanberg just one last question could you also maybe elaborate a little bit more on your intentions in the automotive market obviously you are breaking it out now as a separate end market thats still very small but you did mention you got a lot of technologies you can leverage there so maybe you could just add a little bit more color on where should we expect that start to play and in the car or whether its going to be in for payment or other parts of electronics in the car james lougheed right so what we tend to do as we look at engage with a lot of the customers that weve already engaged with and a lot of those customers who may be playing in the after market space they also play in the oem space so our first target that we discussed and giving us the confidence to enter into this market has really been around the engagements that we’ve had for some time and we’ve started to look at how we can then really address our products from an aecq qualification standpoint and move across into more of the oem type product so weve taken a lot of the existing  some of the existing products that we have and put them on the qual program to have them qualified by i think i mentioned end of this year and that will mostly be i think in the beginning we are talking about infotainment is one of the biggest areas but very quickly we are also getting sucked into some of the fast growing areas within automotive i mentioned that adas some of the power solutions that we have funnily enough some of the constant on time control architecture that we designed for hp is very interesting as we put that across to a high voltage process and take it into the automotive space so i think adas and infotainment are probably the areas that we would be looking at and thats where our engagements are starting right now tore svanberg great very nice quarter guys and ryan thanks for reminding us what exar stands for great quarter guys thank you operator our next question comes from the line of timothy arcuri with cowen karl ackerman hi gentlemen this is karl ackerman on for timothy first question if i  i had two questions first question if i may relative to the cost savings opportunity you see from shifting your supply chain to china what inning if you will are we in for that process helping drive improving gross margins and i guess similar to that you have articulated in the past that the company can achieve  gross margins without any revenue growth so i guess how do we bridge the gap between your results and guidance today versus your long term gross margin goal of  is it really all from volume leverage or is it more from the savings opportunity that you talked about in china keith tainsky this is keith here ill take that one so at a high level i think the path to the target model is really a combination of continued advanced product sales and cost reductions in our supply chain with respect to cost reductions in our supply chain id say we are still on the relatively early innings we had the data up on the chart there that last quarter exar continue operations we were about  of our volume in china on the backend and our goal is to get to  by the end of the year fiscal year so  ryan benton yes so this is ryan id add as well when we started the process of transferring to china at the time of course we  combined entity exar and iml was really started to focus on the iml business first because that really was the lowest hanging fruit and so a lot of the savings that we really got in the first quarter the bulk of saving actually came from the iml side of the business but to be clear the number keith quoted on his slide in his speech did not include the iml savings it was only continuing operation and so i echo keiths comment who indiscernible baseball fan so its softball question early innings in that process karl ackerman got it understood if i may just try and put a finer point on your design wins in the second half of calendar  i appreciate the color on the slide deck on the so called advanced product sales but again looking at your revenue outlook can you quantify how much of the incremental revenue in september is from new design wins and similarly you have talked about in the past how power management opportunity in the server market is expected to ramp in december of course i know you dont want to probably give a full quarter outlook for december but maybe if you could help us frame the sequential contribution from your design wins as they ramp from the june quarter into the back half of  would be helpful thanks james lougheed okay this is james so we dont really  we are not really breaking it out per se in terms of what percentage is coming from our advanced product sales but i think the way to look at it is a majority of the growth that we are getting is going to be coming from the events product sales so you can sort of do the math there what we are talking about right now in terms of  to  next quarter you find that a lot of that would be driven from the events product sales i think that if you asked me the question a year ago i might tell you that it has to be more than to grow but keith has been doing such a good job of bringing the cost down it enabled us to keep healthier margins on the standard commodity business that we are in no rush to turn faucet off on that one we are going to continue our business as well so i think you will see  id look at any of the growth moving forward really becoming from the advanced products and i am not really baseball fan i am more of cricket guy so but i have a shot at it in terms of advanced i would say that we just came out of the dugout operator our next question comes from the line of jon tanwanteng for cjs securities pete lukas yes hi congratulation on the quarter its actually pete lukas for jon i just had a question if you could discuss your plans for share repurchase do you think that it takes place using the funds from the sale leaseback or will you wait until the close of iml to give more on that ryan benton yes thanks for the question this is ryan so as i said in the past capital allocation is always an important conversation that the board will have at every quarter and again we will continue to look at every quarter i think our focus right of course has been in terms of improving exars operations we will obviously look at everything that we have available whether be buyback or dividend we said on the last call we dont see large acquisitions in our future and anywhere in the near time but again in terms of buyback and dividends we will look at those options but yes i think the big decision will really have will be after we close the iml transactions which i referenced earlier which we anticipate that to be by the end of the calendar year and i got asked dozen and dozen of time what we are going to do with the money and ill keep repeating the first thing that we are going to do is cash the check so i think its largely a question that we will be planning and preparing for but we have to make that decision when we close iml pete lukas great thanks and another question on the data compression business and what kind of run rate that can get on a revenue basis james lougheed this is james here pete so we are not looking right now weve got a couple of design wins we are not looking right now at a target for that business per se but it has  it tends to have a bit of step function as we win different models you can see those bit of step function it was decent portion of the growth from advanced sales so we have a couple more design wins that are coming but i havent got really have a run rate that i am looking at but we are not really going to break that out at this point pete lukas great thanks and last one for me you gave us a pretty clear path how you get maybe half way to the target model revenue rate of  million on the last call and just to be get update on your progress and filling in that gap since then james lougheed yes so like i said i think i remember on last call i talked about that we have a lot of design win in sight of the lot of the tier  where i say already on boards on that we have visibility of we can get away to at the time we were  and how we would get half of our way or  and how we would get half the way to the  million target of about  so we still diligently just working on a lot of tier  design wins when it tends to happen or when you win some big wins then people come knocking and people come asking and those tier  customers tend to ask you to design more products for them if you do a good job so we are on target doing well we have obviously a good quarter this quarter even with the week difference for q we are confident to edge our growth as well so very much on target to those plans operator our next question comes from the line of craig ellis with b riley and co craig ellis thanks for taking the questions and not only congratulation to you guys for getting started well as a team but to the entire exar team for what it is record operating income performance in the quarter first just a little clean up on the reported quarter gross margins were up strongly  basis points can you breakout how much of that would have been due to the back end self help initiatives that are in progress versus the product mix dynamics that are also helping gross margins keith tainsky yes i mean i think its fair to say that we had the analysis internally here and it kind of depends on whether you look at would we have back fill that business with other business but ill say rough math  craig ellis okay thats helpful and then looking ahead at the second quarter guidance the sequential growth make sense especially in light of what was say an extra week quarter and strong growth but can you talk about some of the gives and takes in the business such it relates to part of the business you would expect to grow sequentially and are there any headwinds that you are facing in any of the product groups james lougheed hi craig this is james so yes i think in the infrastructure business i did mention in my remarks that we did had some legacy telecom business come down and it was largely offset by the datacom compression well that telecom business will probably drop down a little bit further so id say that the infrastructure business will probably have the biggest headwind within the quarter i think our audiovideo was a little light last quarter and that will probably bounce back little bit and industrial should have probably a normal run rate growth that we probably had  obviously the chinese new year rebound we had pretty good return in that business part of it from the chinese new year rebound so but if you look at the advanced products that are coming through the lot industrial but there is also lot in the infrastructure space its hard to really say how its going to  how these t programs going to ramp craig ellis thats helpful and then just a follow up is related to a comment that you made in discussing that new segments you got to that have strong affinity industrial infrastructure you got three others that are more similar audiovideo automotive and other can you talk about intermediate to long term growth rate of those different businesses which are your faster grower which might be slower grower or steadier and are there any segment there that would have particular makes out challenges that we wanted to be aware as we look out over the next few years and think about the businesses potential to get to the revenue target that you have james lougheed right i think the easy way to look at this is automotive and the infrastructures are going to be the two areas that we will get the most growth out of we will get some pretty strong out of industrial as we leverage a lot of the products we make in the infrastructure but lot of the large tier s they consolidated in automotive and infrastructure and so they are the two product areas that i think what you are going to see from us they are the two areas that we will probably grow the most over the next lets call it  months towards the  million goal craig ellis okay thats helpful and then lastly just thinking about the comments that you gentlemen have conveyed so far and the strength in the advanced product groups is it fair to think that as we close the gap between here and target sales that if the advanced products are about  of the mix now that by the time we get to target levels they could be close to  of total sales james lougheed i would say that my modeling has that somewhere around  to  i brought it down i think we had about  but to the comment i made before we did have plan to grow in advanced and probably turn off a little bit on the commodity devices but as keith continually finds businesses that yesterday were not healthy today are and in the future will be more healthy we are probably going to hold on to some that little bit more so i think the percentage is probably now look more like  to  coming from advanced ryan benton and craig it is ryan so i think i mean thats been one of the  more interesting and fun things is that the operation team has certainly made it competitive an area thats really kind of been nice surprise so that potential where we have some upside growth and some areas that not so long ago we were thinking about exiting craig ellis yes so the improved health comments that james made a really lot more about you getting your cost structure down and having a better margin opportunity on specific products than it is about a change in demand that you are seeing for some of those products is that right ryan ryan benton yes there is elasticity there in some of those products and so when you talk about percentages of the business again i think originally we would think the number of advanced would be higher but some of the other parts of the business are going to their best to keep pace operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line christopher longiaru with sidoti  company christopher longiaru hey guys ill add my congratulation nice quarter so my question is to do with the operating cost structure here so you have all these opportunities can you give us kind of look at how you are  what you are thinking about doing just in terms of operations where your plans are for adding additional talent and just kind of a long term way to think about that ryan benton yes so i mean look i made a couple of important reference where because of the divesture of the iml business leaves us with the few holes that we are in the process of filling so we are  we have  we are hiring sign out in the couple of key areas which is we are adding to our technology team particularly in taiwan and in fremont and then in terms of the sales and marketing team weve been really out to attract top talent in sales and marketing are for over a year now we are going to continue to add that team so from a dollars perspective id expect that rd would grow a bit from here as we look at fiscal year we try and keep the sga kind of similar  at similar level but its clear that what we are finding is somewhat of embarrassment of riches of opportunities and we have to make sure that we have the ability to kind of match that christopher longiaru and just how the visibility changed with your business mode changing i mean i know that lot of sales go through  but just i mean have you essentially elongated your visibility so and what are your turns requirements for your guidance for the quarter james lougheed well this is  christopher this is james here so id expecting to get a lot more visibility out of the tier  engagements because there will be more direct we will get lot more line of site into they ramp and et cetera but i think what weve learned is that sometimes this easy visibility and understanding  customers and just by market area would by market trend which way its going to go we are seeing that some of the tier  ramps they can ramp a lot faster than they thought or lot slower than they thought and sometimes they didnt even know exactly when these things are going to ramp so i dont think we are there yet i think as  i think as lot of the program ramp and they are in full production i think then we will have a much better idea and made visibility into what our businesses are going to look like over the longer term but i wouldnt say that unnecessarily there yet christopher longiaru okay that makes sense and just what are the turns expectations for hitting the midpoint of the guide james lougheed well we dont really look at the turns because we got the two pieces of business in terms of we got our sell through business and we got our commodity type business so the commodity business is only a small or getting the smaller percentage to  smaller percentage of our total business what i can say though is that the booking that we have right now well ahead of where they were last quarter so much less turns needed to hit the pop side of the business or the broken cost channel side of the business those turns needed less ryan benton yes this is ryan id like add  ill add to that which is  this  the quarter we just closed i think everyone from inside would kind describe it as drama free kind of close of the quarter so thats what we were talking gone this far christopher longiaru and then just in terms of that booking being well ahead do you think thats because the inventory the channel correction is nearing an end and there is less inventory in the channel or do you think that it is because of the product that are being ordered can you just give us an idea of how you  why you think those bookings are well ahead of last quarter james lougheed i think that some of that has to do with the operations that we put in place where we have certain work week that we wanted to close down all the orders by so to ryans point we are not rushing around at the last week of the quarter so we are getting a lot of those orders in a lot earlier weve also pre negotiate with our distributors when we think that their inventories should be and i think that as when on incentivizing our distributors to take more inventories with lower prices they tending to put orders on the books for a longer period of time knowing that the asps they are not going to be drop to incentivize there appeared to be no further questions at this time id like to turn the call back over to ryan benton for any additional or closing remark ryan benton thanks operator on the behalf of the exar board of directors and our entire team id like to
