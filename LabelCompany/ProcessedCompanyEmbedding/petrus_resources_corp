  the companys unaudited interim financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern these conditions raise substantial doubt as to the companys ability to continue as a going concern  the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations   in order to continue as a going concern the company will need among other things additional capital resources managements plan is to obtain such resources for the company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity andor debt financing however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern                      petrus resources corporation notes to financial statements unaudited september       note  – related party transactions   the
