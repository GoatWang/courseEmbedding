net loss available to stockholders of  million or  per share for the same period last year excluding special items alon recorded net income available to stockholders of  million or  per share for the first quarter of  compared to net loss available to stockholders of  million or  per share for the same period last year alan moret ceo commented we are very pleased with our strong operational performance in the first quarter of  with both of our refineries setting quarterly total throughput records our operations were complemented by an improvement in our benchmark gulf coast crack spreads relative to the fourth quarter of  and the same quarter last year our first quarter results also benefited from the reduction to rins expense that was booked during the quarter we have been encouraged by the positive trends we have seen in refining into the second quarter of  including improved discounts for midlandpriced crudes and improved crack spreads the big spring refinery achieved record quarterly total throughput of almost  barrels per day in the first quarter of  the refinery operating margin of  per barrel benefited from a strong wholesale marketing environment direct operating expense was only  per barrel as a result of efficient operations we expect total throughput at the big spring refinery to average  barrels per day for the second quarter of  and  barrels per day for the full year of  the krotz springs refinery ran very well in the first quarter of  with total throughput exceeding  barrels per day setting a new record under our ownership the refinery operating margin of  per barrel does not include the  million benefit from the renewable fuel standard exemption as was previously announced in february  the epa approved a small refinery exemption for the krotz springs refinery from the requirements of the renewable fuel standard for the  calendar year on an aftertax basis the impact of the exemption was  million or  per share the krotz springs refinerys direct operating expense of  per barrel was very low and reflects continued efforts to control costs at the refinery we expect total throughput at the krotz springs refinery to average  barrels per day for the second quarter of  and  barrels per day for the full year of  turning to our retail segment our fuel sales volumes increased by  percent in the first quarter of  relative to the same quarter last year despite a lower store count in the first quarter of  samestore fuel sales volumes were up  percent in the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  we continue to expect this business to improve as activity in the permian basin accelerates and as summer driving season begins shai even senior vice president and cfo commented the profitability of our california renewable fuels facility in the first quarter of  was negatively impacted by the expiration of the federal blenders tax credit on december   as a result the facility generated a small operating loss in the first quarter of  however if the blenders tax credit is reinstated and becomes effective retroactively to the beginning of  we will record additional pretax income of  million before the effect of noncontrolling interest total throughput for the first quarter of  averaged approximately  barrels per day first quarter  special items reduced net income by  million for the first quarter of  primarily as a result of employee retention expenses of  million and expenses related to the delek merger of  million partially offset by gains of  million related to an asphalt inventory adjustment and  million associated with gains recognized on disposition of assets before income tax and noncontrolling interest impacts of  million special items increased net loss by  million for the first quarter of  primarily as a result of employee retention expenses of  million unrealized losses of  million associated with commodity swaps and  million associated with losses recognized on disposition of assets before income tax and noncontrolling interest impacts of  million the combined total refinery average throughput for the first quarter of  was  barrels per day bpd consisting of  bpd at the big spring refinery and  bpd at the krotz springs refinery compared to a combined total refinery average throughput of  bpd for the first quarter of  consisting of  bpd at the big spring refinery and  bpd at the krotz springs refinery during the first quarter of  both of the big spring and krotz springs refineries reported the highest total quarterly average throughput since their respective acquisitions the reduced throughput at our big spring refinery during the first quarter of  was the result of planned downtime to complete a reformer regeneration and catalyst replacement for our diesel hydrotreater unit the reduced throughput at the krotz springs refinery during the first quarter of  was the result of our election to reduce the crude rate in order to optimize the refinery yield refinery operating margin at the big spring refinery was  per barrel for the first quarter of  compared to  per barrel for the same period in  this increase in operating margin was primarily due to a higher gulf coast  crack spread and a widening of the wti cushing to wts spread partially offset by the increased premium in wti midland compared to wti cushing increased rins costs and a reduced benefit from the contango market environment which increased the cost of crude refinery operating margin at the krotz springs refinery was  per barrel for the first quarter of  compared to  per barrel for the same period in  this increase in operating margin was primarily due to a higher gulf coast  high sulfur diesel crack spread and reduced rins costs partially offset by the increased premium in wti midland compared to wti cushing and a reduced benefit from the contango market environment which increased the cost of crude in february  the epa approved a small refinery exemption for the krotz springs refinery from the requirements of the renewable fuel standard for the  calendar year resulting in a reduction to rins expense of  million in the first quarter of  the average gulf coast  crack

to adjusted net income loss available to stockholders utilized in determining adjusted earnings loss per share excluding aftertax employee retention expense aftertax expenses related to delek merger aftertax gains on asphalt inventory adjustment aftertax unrealized losses on commodity swaps and aftertax gain loss on disposition of assets adjusted net income loss available to stockholders is not a recognized measurement under gaap however the amounts included in adjusted net income loss available to stockholders are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements our management believes that the presentation of adjusted net income loss available to stockholders and adjusted earnings loss per share excluding these items is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful measurement for evaluation of our companys operating results for the three months ended march    dollars in thousands net income loss available to stockholders     exclude adjustments

adjusted ebitda represents earnings before net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest income tax expense benefit interest expense depreciation and amortization gain loss on disposition of assets and unrealized losses on commodity swaps adjusted ebitda is not a recognized measurement under gaap however the amounts included in adjusted ebitda are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements our management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry in addition our management believes that adjusted ebitda is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of adjusted ebitda generally eliminates the effects of net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest income tax expense benefit interest expense gain loss on disposition of assets unrealized losses on commodity swaps and the accounting effects of capital expenditures and acquisitions items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are • adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments • adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt • adjusted ebitda does not reflect the prior claim that noncontrolling interest have on the income generated by nonwhollyowned subsidiaries • adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs and • our calculation of adjusted ebitda may differ from ebitda calculations of other companies in our industry limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations adjusted ebitda should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally the following table reconciles net income loss available to stockholders to adjusted ebitda for the three months ended march   and  for the three months ended march    dollars in

dividing the margin between net sales and cost of sales exclusive of certain adjustments attributable to each refinery by the refinerys throughput volumes industrywide refining results are driven and
