excavating contractor meet tight tolerances excavation is a precise business tolerances are tight many times inch or less to be successful contractors must utilize machines equipped to efficiently meet projects specs with no rework tec inc tatum excavating company texarkana texas utilizes cat® machines and services to help meet demanding tolerances and better measure machine operation and efficiency a cat m motor grader was purchased recently in part because the blade position is automatically controlled to help the operator meet each project’s exacting grade specifications utilization of a gps grade control system greatly improves the m’s accuracy and efficiency with the technology grade stakes are eliminated and fewer passes are needed to achieve target specifications sensors provide realtime blade position which is compared to a threedimensional electronic site plan the hydraulic system and operator are signaled to raise or lower the blade to achieve design requirements the m as well as a dk and a dk dozer used the gps grade control system for site prep work at a foot expansion of an existing rail spur in pittsburgh texas tec inc duties at the job included construction of  feet of new rail spur associated drainage earthwork ditches the installation of riprap as well as reconstruction of a section of existing rail “on another project we were running  grade tolerance on a onemile road a slipform paver came in right behind the m” says ross sarine vice president “it doesn’t get any better than that” high uptime the company has utilized s•o•ssm fluids sampling for the past  years to help keep its fleet operating at peak performance fluid sampling accurately charts machine performance prevents minor problems from escalating and keeps uptime high “when a component is out of spec we can immediately diagnose the source of the problem before we have a catastrophic failure” sarine says “or it can be as simple as an engine oil fuel cap not sealing properly and it’s letting dust in it gives us a heads up that the naked eye would never catch”  tec measures machine operation cost per hour including repairs and service costs to be sure that machines are working efficiently tracking costs tec inc management knows with certainty that the  cat machines the company owns are the least expensive to own and operate per hour compared to other brands in its mixed fleet “we code all repairs and operational expenses to each machine historically cat machines perform much better in longterm owning and operating costs than other brands cat machines have fewer repairs and better uptime” sarine says he cited a dk dozer purchased in  as an example of the highquality lowmaintenance cat machines in the company’s fleet “the dk had its first system  undercarriage replaced at  hours that’s a huge cost advantage  we replace undercarriages for other brands at  hours” sarine says the rotating bushings in the dozer’s undercarriage increase the component’s life in the highly abrasive sandy environment in which the machine works the dk’s high uptime and long life were key factors in the company’s decision to purchase a dk dozer in  helping hands outstanding support from caterpillar and their local dealer holt cat are important factors when purchasing new machines “having machines working on the job every day is essential the dealer provides the support to help us meet demanding schedules” sarine says “we use holt cat for key repairs and field service even some inshop repairs and service” parts delivery also keeps uptime high “caterpillar has without question the best parts network we can order a part and have it the same day or next morning cat support is ” sarine says tec inc uses its own machines approximately  percent of the time and rents a specialty piece or an additional piece from holt cat to supplement the fleet “that’s when we look to our cat dealer” sarine says “we commonly rent support equipment like compactors we also rent specialty equipment like longreach excavators that we don’t keep in the fleet” in a field where precision is of the utmost importance tec inc has built a reputation for highquality workmanship outstanding production and customer satisfaction “that’s what keeps customers coming back” sarine says tec inc completed construction of the first section of the rail spur in pittsburgh texas more than a decade ago the company was hired to do site prep for the update because the customer remembered the contractor’s skill precision and efficiency that is a legacy that would

product cat  crowley maritime testing caterpillar technology for vessel monitoring  diagnostics  caterpillar engine product  service announcements crowley maritime testing caterpillar technology for vessel monitoring  diagnostics houston tx – calling it “the next logical step in marine technology” crowley maritime corporation is installing cat® asset intelligence software on one of its vessels the tugboat guide a shipassist vessel operating out of seattle is being fitted with a custom vessel monitoring and diagnostics solution which will keep watch over its main engines generators thrusters and critcal systems   while completely automated from data capture through analysis and advisory recommendations for each piece of equipment the caterpillar marine asset intelligence team will provide advisory and management reports including recommendations for individual equipment as well as additional ways crowley can save money and incrementaly improve operations “it’s a robust system that does all the key monitoring and analysis we need” said bill metcalf vice president of strategic engineering for crowley maritime “we’re looking at it as the next level of management and optimization and we want to see how it can help us increase reliability safety and efficiency onboard our vessels” unlike technologies that only monitor engine performance cat® asset intelligence services provide monitoring and diagnostics for an entire vessel including many of its critical operating systems dedicated fleet advisors then use the aggregated data and automated analytics to provide customers such as crowley with actionable advisories to increase vessel productivity and improve equipment management “it’s very scalable and customizable that’s one of the things we liked about this technology” metcalf said “plus cat® asset intelligence will monitor and analyze anything—not just cat® products that was a big selling point as we like many others have a wide variety of equipment that is critical to our success” with the software monitoring and analyzing guide’s key systems crowley maritime expects to see value in a number of areas “it can give us early warning of a catastrophic failure so we can schedule maintenance it can save us time and money during the inspection process it can help us keep our vessels and people out of harm’s way” metcalf said “we’re also looking at fuel savings that’s not likely to be a big issue on guide because of its size and application but it could be huge for our larger vessels” on smaller vessels like guide which operate with a limited crew cat®asset intelligence software’s remote monitoring capabilities play a critical role “guide is a fourman boat which means the chief engineer also serves as a deckhand when he’s on duty” metcalf said “this technology will make his job easier and as its accessable for our engineering staff adding  another set of eyes on the vessel another level of comfort for the captain and operations team”  crowley maritime has established a governance committee to analyze the software’s performance onboard guide and if it proves valuable hopes to expand vessel monitoring and diagnostics to other ships in its fleet “we consider crowley maritime an important partner and we’re working through the cat® asset intelligence journey together” said leslie bellfriedel global business manager for caterpillar marine asset intelligence “there’s a real team mentality in place to ensure they get as much value from this technology as possible” metcalf is confident the addition of cat® asset intelligence technology will help crowley maritime maintain and enhance its reputation as a leader in the areas of safety reliability and efficiency “caterpillar has been a good partner with crowley for many years and they’ve been at this for a long time” he said “this process is in place in mines and factories it’s the next logical step in marine technology and we want to be early adopters if it adds value”

accugrade™ it took almost a year to convince eren insaat to implement the cat® accugradetm grade control system on its equipment fleet—but nearly  million usd in cost savings later the turkish company is a believer with the government of turkey as its customer eren insaat took on a kilometer section of a kilometerlong irrigation canal project when finished the canal will transport water from the ataturk reservoir to irrigate agricultural land in the summer months unfortunately the project started slowly with losses mounting every month the rocky terrain slowed accurate grading and eren insaat could only work during daylight hours due to the need for continuous grade checking five grade checkers were required per machine the fine grading process also required multiple passes plus fuel consumption was extremely high—a significant issue in turkey where fuel prices are among the world’s most expensive company leaders had been exposed to accugrade but internal resistance held them back surveyors didn’t believe the technology could achieve the required accuracy on such large equipment the machine chief wasn’t convinced machine operators could handle such sophisticated systems and the project coordinator was concerned about the required investment—about  million usd—on a project with tight budgets and timeframes ulimately though eren insaat made the decision to move forward installing accugrade on  excavators one motor grader and one dozer the impact has been immediate “previously the grading process was holding up the paving work but this is no longer the case now that we are using accugrade” says yasar eren eren insaat’s chairman “the efficiency is about  percent greater with the gps control—the men can work not only faster but also more accurately” with efficiency gains like these—and significant reductions in the number of machines and workers required on site—eren insaat expects to finish the job about  percent faster than originally scheduled that translates into fuel savings of  million usd and salary and general cost savings of more than  million usd “you have increased my productivity  percent because i’ve seen the possibility of working  hours” eren

gamechanging technology delivers confidence and cost savings  caterpillar gamechanging technology delivers confidence and cost savings don taylor project manager at mcaninch corp an iowa highway utility and heavy construction firm has seen some big breakthroughs in his day—from cable to hydraulics to gps now he’s ready to add another one to the list machine drive power mdp “it’s a gamechanger” he says mdp is a machineintegrated soil compaction measurement technology that evaluates rolling resistance that resistance provides an indication of soil stiffness and loadbearing strength—and whether compaction is adequate to hold the road parking lot building or whatever is planned for a site this proprietary technology is catching the attention of contractors because it works on all soil types including cohesives and can enable a compactor to act as a proof roller even when not vibrating plus mdp can eliminate the need for multiple passes of a compactor and deliver considerable cost savings in altoona iowa mcaninch is putting mdp to the test to determine proactively if compaction is adequate to support a new onoff ramp structure operators inside the mdpequipped cat® csb soil compactor can view realtime results on a monitor in the cab a green area on the display means the area was covered and targets were met a red area indicates troublespots and alerts the operator to make adjustments here’s an example realizing that one red area likely resulted from too much moisture one of mcaninch’s operators switched from the compactor to a tractor and disk and spent about  minutes turning the soil so it would dry more quickly then he took another pass with the csb and the screen turned green “it gives you confidence that you’ve reached density and can move on” taylor says he and others testing mdp say it is a more accurate indicator of stiffness and loadbearing strength than anything they have seen to date perhaps in part because of the high clay content of the iowa soil—though it works well in other materials too “you can add a lot of road life with uniformity” taylor says “states spend a lot of their transportation money on maintenance if the base has no weaknesses you’ll only have to replace a wear course from time to time that is a huge cost savings at a time when every dime is being watched” mcaninch estimates a  percent savings on pass count and a  percent reduction in testing costs using mdp on this project even better there was zero rework—because the company was able to identify potential problems while the base was still open “you can’t leave technology like this on the shelf” taylor says “you would have better measurements and better roads at a lower cost those are tough points to argue” cat® machine drive power cat
