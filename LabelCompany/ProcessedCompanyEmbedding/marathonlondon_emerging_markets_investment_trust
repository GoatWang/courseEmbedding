states international emerging markets fixed income portfolios economies markets rates politics investors in  are facing a world in transition the result of the us presidential election and the earlier vote by british citizens to leave the european union potentially reflect populist sentiment that appears to be challenging the decadeslong march of globalization what’s more investors are recognizing that aggressive central bank stimulus may have reached its limits and a transition to fiscal policy is at hand where should investors turn in such an environment our  outlook takes a trip around the globe detailing the most important economic and investment themes as well as the portfolio implications from investing in a changing world the global economy continues along its lowgrowth path but there are a number of bright spots in the us despite the political uncertainty a strengthening consumer is driving stronger growth a large fiscal stimulus under the new administration could well provide another boost to the us economy and in many emerging markets the rebound that began in  appears to have momentum supported by higher commodities prices and structural reforms europe remains challenged by uncertainty about the future of the european union low growth and high unemployment a sevenyear equity bull market has lifted stock valuations in the us but many parts of the world are trading at discounts emerging markets and international markets are both below their year average pricetoearnings ratio political and economic uncertainty remains but there are bargains to be found for active investors seeking solid companies at attractive prices us government bond yields are near record lows but are actually quite high relative to the rest of the world currently year treasuries yield more than  of developed market sovereign debt even if us rates rise and the new presidential administration’s policies are inflationary the “lower for longer” trend seems sustainable well into next year while europe and japan continue to experiment with negative policy rates and quantitative easing results from the us presidential election and britain’s vote to leave the european union highlighted a year where political populism gained momentum but even amid that uncertainty markets climbed a wall of worry in  the lesson for this it’s better to stick to your longterm plan and not get distracted by the latest political drama looking ahead policy changes will affect individual businesses in different ways so active investors will have an opportunity to build attractive

certify that you have read and agree to our privacy policy next step home blog the fed to perpetuate a strong dollar conversations with professor siegel the fed to perpetuate a strong dollar  jeremy schwartz  director of research tweet share feedback last week professor siegel and i chatted with marc chandler head of global markets strategy at brown brothers harriman about his views on divergent central bank policy actions implications for the us dollar euro and yen as well as his thoughts regarding emerging markets em below is a summary of our conversation spotlight on the federal reserve fed and the european central bank ecb markets have become increasingly convinced that the fed will embark on interest rate normalization at its policy meeting today professor siegel agreed it would happen barring a large market swoon early in the week as a result divergent central bank policy in the developed markets is anticipated to be in focus with the ecb pledging to extend its quantitative easing qe program and taking its monetary policy rate deeper into negative territory and the bank of japan boj in the midst of qe the question remains how policy divergence will impact their local currencies understanding fed funds futures the fed funds target rate implied by futures market pricing is the average effective rate over the course of the month many pricing models assume the fed will target its effective rate at the midpoint of the fed’s target range currently  to  basis points bps  but that is not necessarily the case and the fed may actually target a lower half of the range when setting the policy rate given that the board includes a large number of doves this may be the more likely scenario in which case the federal funds futures market probabilities estimating a rate hike—those based on the midpoint of the range—are understating the actual chance of a hike that said a hike today is widely anticipated and it would be more disruptive to markets if the fed did not move would a rate hike be good for stocks professor siegel and marc chandler both believe that markets may continue to perform well despite a rate hike from the fed chandler states that investors have had a long time to digest this rate hike and it could be seen as good housekeeping where the economy is strong enough to withstand policy normalization while the markets do not typically respond well to tightening policy rates the removal of uncertainty over this hike may become a positive force going into the end of the year interest rate differentials to drive euro lower interest rate differentials are a large driver of currency trends chandler outlines the current market environment at the end of  germany’s twoyear bund yielded more than  basis points higher than the us twoyear today the us twoyear yields more than  basis points above the german twoyear bund this could drive capital flows to the us against the backdrop of the fed’s continuing to hike next year and the ecb potentially having to do more qe if inflation remains low interest rate differentials may stay in favor of the us as a result it is likely that the us dollar will remain well supported from the perspective of interest rate differentials challenging environment for em currencies while em currencies are currently inexpensive based on historical measures of valuations chandler states that they are likely to get even less expensive there are a host of factors that contribute to this general pessimism the first of which being lowerforlonger commodity prices that are likely to push em currencies lower additionally lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in companies’ profitability—particularly in the metals mining and energy sectors—which have subsequently led to cuts in dividends em currencies can account for a large chunk of underperformance across both the equity historically onethird of returns and fixed income asset classes historically twothirds of volatility in returns secondly there are serious geopolitical issues in the em block the geopolitical landscape for many em countries—russia brazil south africa turkey and malaysia to name a few—makes the perspectives for em currencies less encouraging china unlikely to drastically weaken currency chandler believes it is more likely that china will weaken its currency only modestly while a strong dollar is appropriate for the us it is increasingly inappropriate for china given the country’s growth considerations—having pegged its currency to a large degree to the us dollar chandler believes it is likely for the chinese yuan to experience a slow depreciation possibly moving – next year given china’s large trade surplus which ranges between  and  billion per month the political backlash may be severe if china depreciates its currency drastically bottom line in summary divergent central bank policies in developed markets are likely to result in further us dollar strength against the euro and the yen while the current market environment may be challenging for em a first rate hike from the fed and a subsequent slow pace of hikes may provide the region with some temporary reprieve
