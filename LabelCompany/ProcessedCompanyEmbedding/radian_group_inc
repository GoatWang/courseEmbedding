once you’ve established trust and alignment then you can develop and implement plans that fully leverage every stakeholder’s marketing dollar at radian we understand both sides of the table and our process helps balance the retailersupplier equation “we need help building our internal teams capabilities in category business planning and execution in terms of processes and tools” radian will customize our processes tools analyses and deliverables to meet the retailers’ specific needs and baseline capabilities we will train the retailer’s category management and sourcing teams on the new processes and go through a planning cycle to ensure effective implementation “i need better integration of my suppliers into my planning and execution  we arent leveraging our suppliers as well as we should” radian works with suppliers to extend our or the retailers category business planning to key suppliers this includes supplier summit meetings common category measures and analytics and initiative planning and execution  “we need to do a better job on promotion planning and execution  were not getting the best roi on our promotional investments” radian assists the retailer in developing the most effective promotion planning structure and process radian will then customize our promotion analytics toolset to support the process analytics elasticity sales  volume  margin optimization etc “our investments in shopper basket and consumer research arent translating to practical action at the shelf level” radian translates the retailer’s shopper information and analytics

to roi the merger “this category plan provided significant benefits for our customers and the bottom line we were particularly impressed with the depth of the merchandising plan and the ability to communicate the complete story in a clear and concise way  including the financial impacts” challenge the merger of two large retailers required a new integrated approach to category business planning that addressed both the commonalities and differences in the divisions in terms of customer needs and retailer processes capabilities solution radian led a nineweek category planning process for packaged salads the client’s top produce category integrating input from the recently merged divisions and multiple suppliers radian provided assortment optimization processes and tools promotional effectiveness recommendations price elasticity modeling category financial projections and overall project management support project impact the implementation of the category plan resolved product gaps in each division’s assortment promotional frequencies product bundling and promotional depth and adjusted value pricing to drive sales and margin growth results were substantial sales growth rates over  year over year and a  improvement in margin declining sales “i worked with radian at a previous retailer and knew that they could help our organization work more closely with our strategic supplier partners to develop innovative and successful initiatives that benefit both the retailer and the supplier” challenge sales were declining in a number of fresh categories with no substantial changes in pricing or promotion over the last two quarters the organization needed some innovative ideas and a better way to measure the impacts of merchandising changes we selected the fresh chicken category due to an  sales decline and the relative consumer importance for meal preparation solution radian developed comprehensive category analytics and scorecards that exposed the most significant problems for chicken in a single product segment with declining promotional lifts radian leveraged our price elasticity tools to develop a new longterm tpr price plan with the appropriate promotional program changes in depth and frequency total category sales elasticity analysis exposed potential substitute items where price adjustments were needed to minimize cannibalization and maximize overall category results radian worked with the strategic vendor to align the vendor funding to the new promotional and pricing strategies project impact this new pricing strategy was implemented and drove a  improvement in sales dollars and a  improvement in margin for the retailer at the same time the strategic supplier saw a  increase in units creating a substantial win for this new collaboration model promo planning “we leveraged radian’s expertise in promotion optimization to drive real benefits radian enhanced their promotion optimization tool set to work within and across our information systems saving us time and money this allowed us to get benefits much faster than other potential solutions” challenge lack of a robust promotional planning process appropriately defined financial controls and the ability to optimize promotional prices for a regional retailer was causing an inefficient use of promotional investment and significant margin pressure solution radian implemented a promotional planning process with formalized roles and responsibilities throughout the organization and spanned annual quarterly period and weekly planning horizons in addition radian utilized its p optimizertm software to provide promotional price recommendations for all potential weekly ad and tpr promotions optimizing sales and profitability financial metrics radian’s po analytics and optimization process considers past and planned deal information and historical sales and margin data to develop more effective promotion plans project impact the implementation of the new promotional planning process underpinned with more rigid financial controls and the extensive use of the itemlevel price optimization resulted in a  basis point reduction in the overall promotional investment rate leading to a significant improvement in margin rate and net margin dollars integrated strategy “radian has been a great partner in rearchitecting our merchandising vision and establishing core business process and planning capabilities their expertise in food retailing and their analyticallydriven approach to support my teams – from strategic planning through implementation  has resulted in significant measureable sales and margin benefits” challenge sales declines during the recession created significant challenges for this retailer as they had no formal category business planning process and needed to adjust to the new consumer requirements and expectations solution radian established a formal category planning process and supported an accelerated approach for critical categories in addition to longterm staff training and support radian developed and utilized store clustering to customize the assortment and adjust the planogram for improved shopping ease of their quality tiers and brands this assortment ‘overhaul’ was integrated with a comprehensive category pricing and promotional strategy project impact for the coffee category the team developed new own brand products to add lower price point expectations key growth categories were expanded including single cup ethnic and organic products along with pricing and promotion changes this resulted in a  improvement in sales and eliminated the gap to the market trend while increasing the net margin trend by over  cargill tresemmé chiquita colgate sara lee loreal aldi walmart hormel dole supervalu

the time they are instore but also sustain those sales lifts after the events are over radian events have significant impact in elevating the quality image of the retailer – helping carve out a competitive advantage within their markets poor perception “these events are really changing the customer’s perception about our fresh beef program we are making a significant investment in our product quality and item specifications as well as a media campaign – but these events bring it all to life in our stores not only are we winning in beef now but we are converting more customers into the meat department and driving higher basket sales” challenge a large national mass retailer wanted to increase penetration in its premium beef tier to drive more traffic into other categories in the meat department customers and competitors cited the retailer’s lagging quality and service offering as a reason not buy traditional demos were tried but they did not achieve the sales and customer conversion objectives for the retailer solution we worked extensively with merchandising marketing and operations to design a bestinclass fresh beef event program the assortment display fixtures signage and customer talking points were aligned with the overarching marketing and customer strategy radian events sales associates were trained to engage with customers to communicate key product attributes and actively sell items from the event display – or the selfserve case when the events were not in store for maximum longterm benefits project impact the events are not only driving significant sales during the weeks they are instore but also sustaining the sales lift after the events the premium beef tier saw over  growth the total beef program saw  to  growth and the total meat department saw between  and  growth versus the previous year additionally the retailer observed sustained level of performance in the event stores well after the events were run indicating both the initial customer conversion and longterm loyalty for the retailer steep competition “this seafood looks great…i didnt know i could get these kinds of items at this store i usually buy my seafood at another store but now i am buying it here this is going to be a treat for my family and it’s a great value” challenge a limited assortment retailer wanted to drive sales and enhance its image in the perishable departments in a very competitive region against traditional and upscale grocery chains the retailer was known for value in dry goods but had an opportunity in their meat and seafood quality and service image many of the retailer’s existing core customers were shopping for good quality fresh meat and seafood and consequently other basket items with their competitors solution radian events worked with the retailer’s merchandising team to develop the right seafood assortment pricing sourcing signage schedule and instore execution plan we also implemented local market and social media marketing techniques to further educate existing customers and the surrounding trade area about the new offering and quality available at this retailer to drive awareness and customer traffic into the stores project impact radian events generated significant sales growth and customer traffic to the perishables department stores that hosted the “seafood roadshows” realized  to  lift in their fresh seafood items customers were excited to see these products in store and wanted to see both our events and these items in their stores everyday just as important these events helped drive incremental basket sales for the retailer – roughly  to  in incremental basket sales were generated for every dollar purchased out of the seafood roadshow display aligned strategy “until now we have never been able to bring together our marketing strategies store operations and national brands into one easy to understand health and wellness solution for our shoppers these events truly changed the way shoppers view our stores and our hbc department we have been able to educate our shoppers generate sales and increase customer loyalty” challenge executing a large retailer’s ‘health and wellness’ strategy required an innovative approach towards instore display and customer engagement additionally we needed to integrate the brand marketing and promotional support capabilities of national brand hbc suppliers into common themes and customer solutions solution radian events led a comprehensive initiative with the retailer’s merchandising and marketing teams to design events aligned with their health and wellness strategy radian events also worked with the branded health beauty and cosmetics suppliers to integrate key product attributes brand messaging customer education and specific sales targets into the program we provided a turnkey solution for both the retailer and suppliers by bringing together products brand marketing and trained sales associates to activate customer engagement project impact themed monthly events across beauty health and weight loss concepts drove instore theater and significant customer activity into the retailer’s hbc categories and department the events were able to generate sales lifts between x to x for the participating brands in hair care body wash beautycosmetics and weight loss for the retailer these events drove  to  sales lift for the total category and  to  growth for the hbc department product showcase “we are in much better position in our markets thanks to these events before our customers did not believe in the freshness and quality of our perishable departments now these events let us showcase a level of service customer engagement and product quality that our competitors cannot replicate radian events helped us develop rollout and manage this program in all of our banners across the country much faster and more consistently than we otherwise would have done using a traditional approach” challenge a large national grocer was suffering from an identity crisis in their perishables departments especially in seafood the retailer’s goal was to not only close the gap in freshness quality and service but to become a “destination” for seafood this was part of their overall strategy to win in perishables to drive both store choice and total basket sales the retailer needed radian events to act as national program manager to coordinate the program and ensure consistent execution across all of its banners markets and stores solution radian events worked with the lead merchants and the senior teams from key seafood suppliers during the initial ideation and concept development work sessions to identify and define the most important customerfacing issues and opportunities from there we worked extensively with suppliers equipment manufacturers and the retailer’s operations team to develop a program managed by radian events but executed by store staff to meet their service and quality objectives our role included assortment development pricing recommendations promotion planning store scheduling store associate training as well as conducting customer intercepts and program analytics the solution developed was a multiyear program successfully executed for  banners across the country project impact these events had significant impact in elevating the fresh and quality image of the retailer – and helped them carve out a competitive advantage as a “seafood destination” in their markets events routinely drove  to  in sales of fresh seafood beef and other proteins additionally these events actively crossmerchandised high indexing affinity items such as beer wine spices sauces and marinades to generate incremental sales this crossmerchandising and other promotional activity often generated an additional  to  of rest of basket incremental sales over the program life cycle these events generated over  million in target item sales just as importantly the events helped their
