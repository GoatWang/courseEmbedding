the founder of iconic interiors holdsworth has spent nearly a decade researching sourcing and recreating some of the most famous furniture designs in history his first design – a threeseater corner sofa provisionally titled ‘the siena’ – offers fivecornered comfort and iconic’s renowned designer style the siena brings contemporary italian design to the iconic collection with a shape that suits st century living read the full profile the full story when i founded iconic interiors in  i aimed to offer furniture with designer style and great functionality form and function – that’s what great design is all about years later i believe the iconic collection still offers style together with comfort body contouring and durability however after nearly a decade of sourcing and commissioning designer furniture for iconic i knew something was missing from our collection – a truly unique corner sofa corner sofas are ideal for modern living they suit the shape of our homes and our laidback st century home life a welldesigned corner sofa offers comfort relaxation and closeness – exactly what modern homes need i’ve spent many years searching for a model that will compliment the classic designs at iconic but found very few corner sofas that offered both form and function so as the md and founder of iconic interiors i decided to create an exclusive corner sofa for the iconic collection a trip to siena italy inspired me to start sketching and by the time i returned to the uk i had designs for a modern sofa shape that suits st century lifestyles named after its birthplace the siena combines classic design and highend materials to create a thoroughly uptodate relaxation space the siena is a space for enjoying life with family and friends or as a couple the double chaise longue is a unique feature offering a cosy corner for two to relax together or for the family pet to curl up everything about this sofa is comfortable – even the arms have thick cushions for lying or

are here they look stunning we are very happy…thanks see their photographs in our furniture blog istvan budapest feb  the bamberg barcelona chair is an inhouse iconic interiors project the idea came to me when i saw a photograph see below of one of the very early barcelona chairs from  which sold at auction for £ with christies in  the chair looked very old but still beautiful more beautiful i thought than a new chair  which i think can look too pristine i often wonder how one of the first barcelona chairs would have looked i imagine it would have looked a lot more edgy and rugged having visited the mies van der rohe pavilion in barcelona i was fascinated with the barcelona chairs they had on show again they had this very aged appearance extremely lived in but still looking fantastic

st century living read the full profile the full story the photograph below was used by christies auction house in holland in  it pictures one of the original barcelona chairs designed by mies van der rohe the chair finally sold for a staggering £ astonishing this photograph and my visit to the pavilion in barcelona gave me the idea of creating a chair more akin to this early creations i inspected the barcelona chairs very carefully and noticed how coarse they were constructed this to me did not distract from the design one bit for me it enhanced the appearance one thing which struck me was the thickness and rawness of the leather straps the modern barcelona chairs are arguably too clean too perfect when i returned to my work shop in east yorkshire i set about creating my homage to these early barcelona chairs more information and photographs can be found in our designer furniture blog if you have any questions about the bamberg barcelona chair or any of our pieces please email me or
