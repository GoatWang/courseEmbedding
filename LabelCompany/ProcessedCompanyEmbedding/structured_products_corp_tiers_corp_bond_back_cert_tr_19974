yield go corporate bonds corporate bonds are debt obligations issued by corporations to fund capital improvements expansions debt refinancing or acquisitions interest is subject to federal state and local taxes open an account reasons to consider corporate bonds range of choice new issues through corporatenotes programsm find corporate bonds find bonds types features  benefits risks types the range of corporate bonds issued each year allows investors to tailor a bond portfolio around their specific needs the various types of corporate bonds offer different risk levels as well as varying yields and payment schedules fixedrate coupons the most common form of corporate bond is one that has a stated coupon that remains fixed throughout the bond’s life it represents the annual interest rate usually paid in two installments every six months although some bonds pay annually quarterly or monthly the payment amount is calculated as a percentage of the par value regardless of the purchase price or current market value with corporate bonds one bond represents  par value so a  fixedrate coupon will pay  per bond annually  ×  the payment cycle is not necessarily aligned to the calendar year it begins on the dated date which is either on or soon after the bond’s issue date and ends on the bond’s maturity date when the final coupon and return of principal payment are paid investment grade vs noninvestment grade high yield corporate bonds are generally rated by one or more of the three primary ratings agencies standard  poor’s moody’s and fitch these firms base their ratings on the bond issuer’s financial health and likely ability to make interest payments and return the bondholders’ principal rated bonds fall into one of two categories investment grade or noninvestment grade also known as high yield investment grade bonds are considered to be lower risk and therefore generally pay lower interest rates than noninvestment grade bonds though some are more highly rated than others within the category noninvestment grade bonds are considered to be higher risk or speculative investments the higher yield reflects an increased risk of default a company’s financial health can change and when it does its bonds’ ratings may change as well so an investment grade bond could become noninvestment grade over time and vice versa zerocoupon zerocoupon corporate bonds are issued at a discount from face value par with the full value including imputed interest paid at maturity interest is taxable even though no actual payments are made prices of zerocoupon bonds tend to be more volatile than bonds that make regular interest payments floatingrate the coupon on a floatingrate corporate bond changes in relationship to a predetermined benchmark such as the spread above the yield on a sixmonth treasury or the price of a commodity this reset can occur multiple times per year the coupon and benchmark can also have an inverse relationship variable and adjustablerate variable and adjustablerate corporate bonds are similar to floatingrate bonds except that coupons are tied to a longterm interest rate benchmark and are typically only reset annually callable and puttable the issuer of a callable corporate bond maintains the right to redeem the security on a set date prior to maturity and pay back the bond’s owner either par full value or a percentage of par value the call schedule lists the precise call dates of when an issuer may choose to pay back the bonds and the price at which they will do so the callable price is generally expressed as a percent of par value but other allprice quotation methods exist with a puttable security or put option the investor has the right to put the security back to the issuer again at a set date or a trigger event prior to maturity a common example is the “survivor’s option” whereby if the owner of the bond dies the heirs have the ability to put back the bond to the issuer and typically receive par value in return stepup stepup corporate bonds pay a fixed rate of interest until the call date at which time the coupon increases if the bond is not called stepdown interest on stepdown securities is paid at a fixed rate until the call date at which time the coupon decreases if the bond is not called convertible bonds convertible bonds can be exchanged for a specified amount of the common stock of the issuing company although provisions generally restrict when a conversion can take place while these bonds offer the potential for appreciation of the underlying security prices may be susceptible to stock market fluctuations  these types of corporate bonds are not available to purchase through fidelity features  benefits choice the range of corporate bonds issued each year allows investors to tailor a bond portfolio around specific needs investors should however consider that each issuer has its own unique risk profile secondary market an active secondary market exists for many corporate bonds which creates liquidity for investors investors need to remember that some issues can be thinly traded which may impact pricing and may pose a challenge when selling new issues customers are able to access new issue corporate bonds through the corporatenotes programsm each week a limited number of new issue corporate bonds are available for purchase at par in minimum denominations of  without additional trading concessions ratings most corporate bonds are rated by at least one of the major rating agencies fidelity offers both investment grade and noninvestment grade bonds which are classified according to their rating when considering an investment in corporate bonds remember that higher potential returns are typically associated with greater risk yields corporate bonds are among the highest yielding fixed income securities in fact the yield differential over treasuries may be great enough to outpace inflation over the long term because interest is fully taxable buyers should evaluate their tax situations before investing risks when investing in corporate bonds investors should remember that multiple risk factors can impact short and longterm returns understanding these risks is an important first step towards managing them credit and default risk corporate bonds are subject to credit risk it’s important to pay attention to changes in the credit quality of the issuer as less creditworthy issuers may be more likely to default on interest payments or principal repayment if a bond issuer fails to make either a coupon or principal payment when they are due or fails to meet some other provision of the bond indenture it is said to be in default one way to manage this risk is to diversify across different issuers and industry sectors market risk price volatility of corporate bonds increases with the length of the maturity and decreases as the size of the coupon increases changes in credit rating can also affect prices if one of the major rating services lowers its credit rating for a particular issue the price of that security usually declines event risk a bond’s payments are dependent on the issuer’s ability to generate cash flow unforeseen events could impact their ability to meet those commitments call risk many corporate bonds may have call provisions which means they can be redeemed or paid off at the issuer’s discretion prior to maturity typically an issuer will call a bond when interest rates fall potentially leaving investors with a capital loss or loss in income and less favorable reinvestment options prior to purchasing a corporate bond determine whether call provisions exist makewhole calls some bonds give the issuer the right to call a bond but stipulate that redemptions occur at par plus a premium this feature is referred to as a makewhole call the amount of the premium is determined by the yield of a comparable mature treasury security plus additional basis points because the cost to the issuer can often be significant makewhole calls are rarely invoked sector risk corporate bond issuers fall into four main sectors industrial financial utilities and transportation bonds in these economic sectors can be affected by a range of factors including corporate events consumer demand changes in the economic cycle changes in regulation interest rate and commodity volatility changes in overseas economic conditions and currency fluctuations understanding the degree to which each sector can be influenced by these factors is the first step toward building a diversified bond portfolio interest rate risk if interest rates rise the price of existing bonds usually declines that’s because new bonds are likely to be issued with higher yields as interest rates increase making the old or outstanding bonds less attractive if interest rates decline however bond prices usually increase which means an investor can sometimes sell a bond for more than face value since other investors are willing to pay a premium for a bond with a higher interest payment the longer a bond’s maturity the greater the impact a change in interest rates can have on its price if you’re holding a bond until maturity interest rate risk is not a concern inflation risk like all bonds corporate bonds are subject to inflation risk inflation may diminish the purchasing power of a bond’s interest and principal foreign risk in addition to the risks mentioned above there are additional considerations for bonds issued by foreign governments and corporations these bonds can experience greater volatility due to increased political regulatory market or economic risks these risks are usually more pronounced in emerging markets which may be subject to greater social economic regulatory and political uncertainties next steps find corporate bonds choose from  new issue and secondary market bonds  cds and approximately  total offerings with our depth of book learn about fixed income alerts get

are debt obligations issued by corporations to fund capital improvements expansions debt refinancing or acquisitions interest is subject to federal state and local taxes open an account reasons to consider corporate bonds range of choice new issues through corporatenotes programsm find corporate bonds find bonds types features  benefits risks types the range of corporate bonds issued each year allows investors to tailor a bond portfolio around their specific needs the various types of corporate bonds offer different risk levels as well as varying yields and payment schedules fixedrate coupons the most common form of corporate bond is one that has a stated coupon that remains fixed throughout the bond’s life it represents the annual interest rate usually paid in two installments every six months although some bonds pay annually quarterly or monthly the payment amount is calculated as a percentage of the par value regardless of the purchase price or current market value with corporate bonds one bond represents  par value so a  fixedrate coupon will pay  per bond annually  ×  the payment cycle is not necessarily aligned to the calendar year it begins on the dated date which is either on or soon after the bond’s issue date and ends on the bond’s maturity date when the final coupon and return of principal payment are paid investment grade vs noninvestment grade high yield corporate bonds are generally rated by one or more of the three primary ratings agencies standard  poor’s moody’s and fitch these firms base their ratings on the bond issuer’s financial health and likely ability to make interest payments and return the bondholders’ principal rated bonds fall into one of two categories investment grade or noninvestment grade also known as high yield investment grade bonds are considered to be lower risk and therefore generally pay lower interest rates than noninvestment grade bonds though some are more highly rated than others within the category noninvestment grade bonds are considered to be higher risk or speculative investments the higher yield reflects an increased risk of default a company’s financial health can change and when it does its bonds’ ratings may change as well so an investment grade bond could become noninvestment grade over time and vice versa zerocoupon zerocoupon corporate bonds are issued at a discount from face value par with the full value including imputed interest paid at maturity interest is taxable even though no actual payments are made prices of zerocoupon bonds tend to be more volatile than bonds that make regular interest payments floatingrate the coupon on a floatingrate corporate bond changes in relationship to a predetermined benchmark such as the spread above the yield on a sixmonth treasury or the price of a commodity this reset can occur multiple times per year the coupon and benchmark can also have an inverse relationship variable and adjustablerate variable and adjustablerate corporate bonds are similar to floatingrate bonds except that coupons are tied to a longterm interest rate benchmark and are typically only reset annually callable and puttable the issuer of a callable corporate bond maintains the right to redeem the security on a set date prior to maturity and pay back the bond’s owner either par full value or a percentage of par value the call schedule lists the precise call dates of when an issuer may choose to pay back the bonds and the price at which they will do so the callable price is generally expressed as a percent of par value but other allprice quotation methods exist with a puttable security or put option the investor has the right to put the security back to the issuer again at a set date or a trigger event prior to maturity a common example is the “survivor’s option” whereby if the owner of the bond dies the heirs have the ability to put back the bond to the issuer and typically receive par value in return stepup stepup corporate bonds pay a fixed rate of interest until the call date at which time the coupon increases if the bond is not called stepdown interest on stepdown securities is paid at a fixed rate until the call date at which time the coupon decreases if the bond is not called convertible bonds convertible bonds can be exchanged for a specified amount of the common stock of the issuing company although provisions generally restrict when a conversion can take place while these bonds offer the potential for appreciation of the underlying security prices may be susceptible to stock market fluctuations  these types of corporate bonds are not available to purchase through fidelity features  benefits choice the range of corporate bonds issued each year allows investors to tailor a bond portfolio around specific needs investors should however consider that each issuer has its own unique risk profile secondary market an active secondary market exists for many corporate bonds which creates liquidity for investors investors need to remember that some issues can be thinly traded which may impact pricing and may pose a challenge when selling new issues customers are able to access new issue corporate bonds through the corporatenotes programsm each week a limited number of new issue corporate bonds are available for purchase at par in minimum denominations of  without additional trading concessions ratings most corporate bonds are rated by at least one of the major rating agencies fidelity offers both investment grade and noninvestment grade bonds which are classified according to their rating when considering an investment in corporate bonds remember that higher potential returns are typically associated with greater risk yields corporate bonds are among the highest yielding fixed income securities in fact the yield differential over treasuries may be great enough to outpace inflation over the long term because interest is fully taxable buyers should evaluate their tax situations before investing risks when investing in corporate bonds investors should remember that multiple risk factors can impact short and longterm returns understanding these risks is an important first step towards managing them credit and default risk corporate bonds are subject to credit risk it’s important to pay attention to changes in the credit quality of the issuer as less creditworthy issuers may be more likely to default on interest payments or principal repayment if a bond issuer fails to make either a coupon or principal payment when they are due or fails to meet some other provision of the bond indenture it is said to be in default one way to manage this risk is to diversify across different issuers and industry sectors market risk price volatility of corporate bonds increases with the length of the maturity and decreases as the size of the coupon increases changes in credit rating can also affect prices if one of the major rating services lowers its credit rating for a particular issue the price of that security usually declines event risk a bond’s payments are dependent on the issuer’s ability to generate cash flow unforeseen events could impact their ability to meet those commitments call risk many corporate bonds may have call provisions which means they can be redeemed or paid off at the issuer’s discretion prior to maturity typically an issuer will call a bond when interest rates fall potentially leaving investors with a capital loss or loss in income and less favorable reinvestment options prior to purchasing a corporate bond determine whether call provisions exist makewhole calls some bonds give the issuer the right to call a bond but stipulate that redemptions occur at par plus a premium this feature is referred to as a makewhole call the amount of the premium is determined by the yield of a comparable mature treasury security plus additional basis points because the cost to the issuer can often be significant makewhole calls are rarely invoked sector risk corporate bond issuers fall into four main sectors industrial financial utilities and transportation bonds in these economic sectors can be affected by a range of factors including corporate events consumer demand changes in the economic cycle changes in regulation interest rate and commodity volatility changes in overseas economic conditions and currency fluctuations understanding the degree to which each sector can be influenced by these factors is the first step toward building a diversified bond portfolio interest rate risk if interest rates rise the price of existing bonds usually declines that’s because new bonds are likely to be issued with higher yields as interest rates increase making the old or outstanding bonds less attractive if interest rates decline however bond prices usually increase which means an investor can sometimes sell a bond for more than face value since other investors are willing to pay a premium for a bond with a higher interest payment the longer a bond’s maturity the greater the impact a change in interest rates can have on its price if you’re holding a bond until maturity interest rate risk is not a concern inflation risk like all bonds corporate bonds are subject to inflation risk inflation may diminish the purchasing power of a bond’s interest and principal foreign risk in addition to the risks mentioned above there are additional considerations for bonds issued by foreign governments and corporations these bonds can experience greater volatility due to increased political regulatory market or economic risks these risks are usually more pronounced in emerging markets which may be subject to greater social economic regulatory and political uncertainties next steps find corporate bonds
