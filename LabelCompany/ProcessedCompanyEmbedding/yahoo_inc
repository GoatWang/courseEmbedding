iq and yahoo press release  commenting on the results ceo marissa mayer said in a press release we anticipated that we would grow gaap revenue ahead of revenue extac and ebitda and thats precisely what we saw this quarter for the next phase of the transformation we will focus on accelerating our gaap revenue growth while managing our margins and costs what went right mayer is correct to point to topline gains gross revenue was up  before tac or traffic acquisition costs mobile up  and inhouse search up  helped produce the gain we may see even more of this sort of growth in future quarters now that yahoo has reached an amended nonexclusive accord with microsoft nasdaqmsft to pursue search deals on any platform expect mayer to go where the money is  what went wrong growth didnt come cheap tac soared  as search became more expensive specifically searchrelated tac jumped over a hundredfold  from  to just over  million development costs for new and existing apps also surged rising  and taking a bite out of profits separately cash flow from operations or cffo suffered a  billion hit from taxes due on the sale of alibaba nysebaba stock without it cffo was on track to more than double whats next yahoo chose not to provide a secondquarter outlook in its press release analysts tracked by sp capital iq have the company generating  million in revenue and  a share in adjusted profit versus  million and  a share in last years q longer term analysts have yahoo earnings declining an average of  annually over the next three to five years and in terms of the overall business investors should be watching for signs that mayer is making good on her promise to reverse the equation and grow revenue faster than tac if she proves up to the task cash and profits will flow like a

by john shinal published oct    pm et share commentary mayer’s investments have yet to pay off by johnshinal bloomberg marissa mayer logged more than a dozen years at google before taking the helm at yahoo in july  yahoo inc ceo marissa mayer has been hiring product engineers this year with the same gusto as when she was a top executive at google inc the problem with that strategy is that yahoo usyhoo unlike its larger rival goog  isn’t seeing any revenue boost yet from its investments productdevelopment costs surged  in the third quarter compared with the same period a year ago while revenue slipped  on a yearoveryear basis minus trafficacquisition costs or tac that helps explain why yahoo’s thirdquarter operating income showed a yearoveryear drop of  after that important metric had climbed  during the first six months of  yahoo reported its thirdquarter results late tuesday much of that higher spending was due to the acquisition of tumblr which yahoo bought earlier this year for close to  billion and whose operating expenses are now counted on yahoo’s income statement according to cfo ken goldman but mayer has also been on a hiring binge at yahoo especially in engineering bringing  engineers aboard so far this year sales and marketing costs also rose climbing  on a yearoveryear basis while yahoo’s total operating costs in the quarter were held flat from a year ago at  billion they would have risen if the company hadn’t booked a restructuring charge in the yearearlier period mayer and cfo goldman both said during the company’s earnings conference call tuesday that expenses are expected to level off in  that may be just in time for yahoo shareholders since the company also issued a fourthquarter revenue forecast range that was slightly below wall street’s earlier expectations the new forecast signals that yahoo will post either little or no topline growth in  mayer’s first full year at the helm even though the company’s number of paid search clicks rose  in the third quarter the justcompleted quarter saw a huge decline in another important yahoo metric cash flow from operations net operating cash plunged  during the quarter compared with a year earlier and is down  for the first nine months of this year all this might be cause for alarm if not for yahoo’s lucrative stake in alibaba the biggest onlinecommerce company in china earnings wall discuss key earnings announcements before and after results come in learn more some wall street analysts estimate that at least half of yahoo’s  billion market valuation is owed to its alibaba shares which are expected to soar in value with an alibaba ipo sources have told this column that the offering will come next year and goldman said tuesday that yahoo does “expect that alibaba will ipo at some point” though he didn’t offer any time frame yahoo said it had amended a prior agreement with alibaba and will now sell at least  million shares of the company in any ipo down from at least  million shares previously yahoo invested  billion in alibaba in  in exchange for a  stake and still owns about a quarter of the company once it does sell alibaba shares yahoo will be able to book extraordinary gains from those transactions for at least several quarters as it did after selling a large alibaba stake last september yahoo has been using the gains from that sale to fund investments and buy back shares thereby reducing its share count and raising pershare earnings even as it does yahoo will continue to benefit from its equity interests in both alibaba and yahoo japan as it did in the third quarter yet the gains from any alibaba share sales will be booked in a limited number of quarters even as yahoo’s operations continue to struggle and investors just got a preview of what yahoo’s financials might look like after the alibaba gains are gone on a gaap basis yahoo’s net income plunged by  in the third quarter to  million or  cents per share that’s because last year’s thirdquarter earnings line ballooned by  billion with the sale of alibaba shares and  of net income for the third quarter was due to what’s called “earnings from equity interests” on yahoo’s income statement — which is primarily from the investments in yahoo japan and alibaba that line rose to  million in other words less than a quarter of yahoo’s net profit came from its own operations investors whose optimism has helped drive a doubling of yahoo’s share price since mayer took the ceo job in july  should be aware that they’re making a bet on a revenue turnaround that has yet to materialize unless yahoo’s investments begin to boost its top line growth investors should be nowhere near this stock once the company has booked most of the financial gains from its alibaba share

situations quantitative hedge fund managerroundabout asset management llcsummaryspinoff of alibaba shares is a significant valuation catalystupside of  should be realized in less than twelve monthsrecent concerns over taxminimizing corporate transactions has presented this opportunitybackground on january   yahoo inc yhoo released its q earnings as part of the release yhoo informed shareholders that it would spinoff the remainder of its stake in alibaba group nysebaba in a taxfree manner to shareholders based on a sumoftheparts analysis yhoo shares are trading at a significant discount to fair value and provide an attractive opportunity for investors company description founded in  by jerry yang and david filo yhoo is a global internet media company that offers communications content and a community platform that delivers consumer experiences and advertising solutions across digital screens revenues are derived between search  display  and other  the company has struggled in recent years with competition from google facebook and other social media platforms as indicated by revenue contraction in seven out of the past eight quarters ceo marissa mayer was hired in  to turnaround the failing core business but improvements have yet to materialize the significant rise in yhoo shares since her hiring are due to the companys holdings of alibaba group and yahoo japan corp otcpkyahoy spinoff details the spinoff of baba shares to yhoo shareholders is expected to occur in the q after yhoos lockup expires in september  the spinco will house all of yhoos remaining shares in baba and a legacy ancillary operating business of yahoo active trade or business or atb the spinco will assume no debt and yhoo will retain its cash the transaction still requires board irs and sec approval most importantly the company will look to the irs to provide a favorable ruling in regard to the taxfree nature of the deal the proposed transaction is similar in nature to the recent spinoff of liberty tripadvisor holdings inc nasdaqltrpa from liberty ventures nasdaqlvnta in  which we use as a proxy for timing purposes the proforma structure of yhoo and spinco is as follows opportunity   upside in  months the spinoff of ltrpa from lvnta took  days between announcement to completion and i believe this transaction should be no different the valuation framework deployed below contains a few assumptions that err on the side of conservatism given that the spinco will not be a pureplay the shares will trade at a discount to baba shares however given that the atb will likely be immaterial compared with the value of the baba shares  billion and relatively equal liquidity between the spinco shares and baba shares spinco will have  million baba shares vs the  million shares offered in the ipo i estimate that the discount will be minimal and likely in the neighborhood of  assuming this transaction goes forward shareholders can expect yahoy to be spunoff in a similar manner however given the potential taxable event i have assigned a  discount for the core yhoo business i am using the average analyst estimated ebitda for fy and applying a x evebitda multiple this multiple is significantly below comps and below analysts estimates who favor using a higher multiple closer to x by my estimates on a higher  ebitda level according to one analyst the peer group trades at x ebitda implying that i am using a  discount to peers i apply a  discount to yhoos net cash position as while i believe yahoos management will remain good stewards of capital the company has reduced gross shares outstanding by  since  for  billion there could be potential for dilutive spending by management the company has said that it anticipates returning  of the aftertax proceeds to shareholders so we know that at least half of the cash on hand will not be used inappropriately in addition to the individual component discounts i apply a  holdco discount to the remaining yahoy yhoo core business and yhoo net cash as i believe the street will ultimately assess a sumoftheparts discount on the holdco risks core yhoo continues decline revenue extac and adjusted ebitda were down  and  respectively in  and analysts are estimating that revenue and ebitda will fall  and  respectively in  according to bloomberg while mayer has tried to stabilize and grow the business there is no guarantee that she will be successful in the near future the valuation framework used considers this fact and if the core business turns around there is additional upside for shareholders unfavorable irs ruling while yhoo has enlisted the help of tax advisors before announcing the spinoff and even considering the ltrpa spinoff there is no guarantee that the irs will allow the taxfree deal if the irs does not give its approval shareholders are likely to value yhoo assuming baba and yahoy are fullytaxed which could push shares of yhoo down to   downside technical details in order to capture the spread described in the valuation section investors should short  shares of baba for every one share of yhoo and short  shares of yahoy for every one share of yhoo this refers to the shares traded in japan and not the adr that this article references these ratios will ensure yhoo shareholders are not impacted by the changes in baba and yahoy share prices borrowing costs are currently minimal conclusion while the arbitrage community may be somewhat apprehensive about taxrelated deals after the recent fallout from the shireabbvie cancelled merger the spinoff of baba shares from yhoo is far less likely to run into any trouble with the irs and the current upside makes this an attractive situation disclosure the author is long yhoo the author wrote this article themselves and it expresses their own opinions the author is not receiving compensation for it the author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article additional

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this

may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
