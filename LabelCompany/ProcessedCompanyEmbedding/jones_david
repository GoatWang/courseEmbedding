free of posttraumatic stress disorder david jones now has—thanks to thomas dilworth—a biography worthy of his originality and genius” —the washington post among the revolutions of the last century none was more important or potentially more lasting than the one in the arts called “modernism” among the giants of that movement were writers who changed our conceptions of poetry and prose forever now well into the new century we can look back to admire and reflect on figures from that period last year saw biographies of two monumental poets of modernism robert crawford’s first volume on t s eliot and david moody’s concluding third volume on the life of ezra pound we are excited to announce the first fulllength critical biography of the third member too often overlooked of that extraordinary group the beautifully illustrated david jones engraver soldier painter poet by thomas dilworth will stand for generations as the great biography this wonderful artist deserves jones – was a painter a woodand copperengraver and maker of painted inscriptions but it was as a poet that he left his most lasting mark eliot called him “one of the most distinguished writers of my generation” and dylan thomas said he “would like to have done anything as good as david jones has done” auden praised his poem in parenthesis as “the greatest book ever about the great war” and the anathemata as one of the “truly great poems in western literature” his work the whole of it enables him to stand alongside eliot pound and james joyce as an incomparable figure in literary modernism about thomas dilworth thomas dilworth is a distinguished professor at the university of windsor canada and specializes in modern british and irish literature he is a fellow of the royal society of canada he knew david jones personally along with jones’s closest friends and spent thirty years researching and writing jones’s biography he is the world’s leading authority on david jones and has edited and published several academic editions of and books on jones’ work praise “it’s ever so rarely you get a perfect biography a marvellous match of subject and writer—but thomas dilworth’s biography of david jones is just that” —evening standard “an overdue biography    jones’s achievements as a modernist writer rank him alongside t s eliot and james joyce” —the economist “lavishly illustrated and wonderfully well written… dilworth is that rare thing a scholar who has the capacity for great clarity” —rachel cooke the guardian “as professor dilworth makes the backgrounds of jones’s writing clearer and more comprehensible he confirms the power depth and relevance of his work as a whole” —ws merwin “dilworth is deft at tracing two of the essential ingredients in jones’s life and work… a wonderful book” —the spectator “dilworth is a brilliant describer and analyst of the art his descriptions would make individual works vivid to the reader even if they weren’t reproduced in this richly illustrated book” —the guardian “thomas dilworth’s welcome and superbly produced biography will clearly be the point of reference for jones’s life for a long time to come” —new statesman “dilworth’s narrative sympathetically illuminates the workings of a troubled original mind its interplay with midth century english intellectual life and its continuing resonance”

heapanalyticscomanswer wiki answers simon huggins former product manager for sap hybris ecommerce suiteanswered w agoyou need to get your product known in smaller outlets first prove you have something that is growing in popularity yearonyear and try to get market data on the demographics  geography of people who are buying the product so that the retailer can understand that they are not taking on risk by introducing the product and are likely to be making money from their very valuable use of shelf space bear in mind that if they adopt your product then they are having to deny someone else that space so you need to know your competition to ensure you offer something that incumbents in the market are not or that you are introducing something that is genuinely new and there is a proven trend of adoption in the broader marketalternatively get backing from an existing company or financial backer that has presence in that market already  either financial investment or see if you can get them to adopt your product but youll have to go through the same kind of exercise with them more than likelybe careful though  you will need to also prove that you can upscale your operation to provide a larger quantity on demand which may require substantial financial outlay and if your product is summarily dumped then you may have a lot of overheads loans etc but no market to shift your products to  once you get engaged in this scale of market you are at the mercy of the retailers and they will do what they can to reduce your profit margin in favor of making money themselves leaving you with potentially reduced opportunity to further upscaleyou are much better to gradually upscale through smaller retailers  you expose yourself to less risk from large retail outlets get a grass roots following and get to plan your upscaling in a more measured wayalso why the internet is your friend  why not concentrate on this market  its much less risky and again easier to upscale according to demand  reach into new marketsbe very very careful retail is not a market for the fainthearted views · answer requested by  personpromoted by chartiohow is your startup doing

others have commented  you can get in direct contact with the buying department and send them information however sometimes the larger the retailer the harder it is to even get an opportunity to even have your product reviewedone of the best ways to get your product reviewed is to hire a sales company that already has good contacts and track record and knows the correct people to get your product reviewed by depending on the industry theses outside salesmen may be called manufacturers representatives or brokers they are usually  paid on a commission basis only views ·  upvote · answer
