advisory and asset management services to encourage private sector development in developing countries the ifc is a member of the world bank group and is headquartered in washington dc it was established in  as the private sector arm of the world bank group to advance economic development by investing in forprofit and commercial projects for poverty reduction and promoting development the ifcs stated aim is to create opportunities for people to escape poverty and achieve better living standards by mobilizing financial resources for private enterprise promoting accessible and competitive markets supporting businesses and other private sector entities and creating jobs and delivering necessary services to those who are povertystricken or otherwise vulnerable since  the ifc has focused on a set of development goals that its projects are expected to target its goals are to increase sustainable agriculture opportunities improve healthcare and education increase access to financing for microfinance and business clients advance infrastructure help small businesses grow revenues and invest in climate health the ifc is owned and governed by its member countries but has its own executive leadership and staff that conduct its normal business operations it is a corporation whose shareholders are member governments that provide paidin capital and have the right to vote on its matters originally it was more financially integrated with the world bank group but later the ifc was established separately and eventually became authorized to operate as a financiallyautonomous entity and make independent investment decisions it offers an array of debt and equity financing services and helps companies face their risk exposures while refraining from participating in a management capacity the corporation also offers advice to companies on making decisions evaluating their impact on the environment and society and being responsible it advises governments on building infrastructure and partnerships to further support private sector development the corporation is assessed by an independent evaluator each year in  its evaluation report recognized that its investments performed well and reduced poverty but recommended that the corporation define poverty and expected outcomes more explicitly to betterunderstand its effectiveness and approach poverty reduction more strategically the corporations total investments in  amounted to  billion it committed  million to advisory services for  projects in  and held  billion worth of liquid assets the ifc is in good financial standing and received the highest ratings from two independent credit rating agencies in  and  ifc comes under frequent criticism from ngos that it is not able to track its money because of its use of financial intermediaries for example a report by oxfam international and other ngos in  the suffering of others found the ifc was not performing enough due diligence and managing risk in many of its investments in thirdparty lenders  other criticism focuses on ifc working excessively with large companies or wealthy individuals already able to finance their investments without help from public institutions such as ifc and such investments do not have an adequate positive development impact an example often cited by ngos and critical journalists is

download ifc cafeteria – low resolution download creating a contemporary cafeteria at international finance corporation plexineon makes a vital common space modern and welcoming international finance corporation ifc is the largest global development institution in the world a member of the world bank group ifc’s stated mission is to create jobs raise living standards and build a better future for millions of people by offering investment advisory and asset management services to encourage private sector development in more than  developing countries looking toward its own future ifc recently renovated the interior of its squarefoot headquarters in washington dc nearly  staff members work in the triangularshaped building that is located just blocks from the white house among the areas upgraded was the squarefoot cafeteria which encompasses a kitchen as well as a serving and dining area modernizing the space included installing ilight plexineon white x k fixtures as a design element the led fixtures accent the vertical lines of structural columns that are located in the middle of what is now a more welcoming and contemporary common area   the design challenge rather than ignore the columns rtkl the project architect chose to embrace them careful traffic flow planning assures the columns are not a physical hindrance but a solution was still needed to make them less visually obtrusive working closely with rtkl architectural lighting design firm mcla suggested outlining the columns with plexineon which the firm had used successfully on prior projects “we talked about providing an illuminated reveal but we decided a luminous line of light would be more interesting” – frank feist senior designer at mcla   the plexineon advantage plexineon not only provided the even line of bright light that the team was envisioning it also helped that ilight was able to bend the fixtures to follow the four compound curves on each column “the plexineon really does accentuate the hourglass shape” feist says the result is transformative — plexineon adds lightness to the heavy columns accenting their sculptural nature once installed the design team was delighted that the fixtures provide a glow that’s more contemporary than nostalgic feist says “rather than look like neon the plexineon has a modern feel that’s perfect for what we were trying to achieve” the glow of plexineon white adds lightness to the heavy columns accenting their sculptural nature ifc cafeteria – high resolution download ifc cafeteria – low resolution download   project details project ifc
