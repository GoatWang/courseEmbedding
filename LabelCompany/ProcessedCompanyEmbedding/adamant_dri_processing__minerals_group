operations overview we seek to profit by participating in various aspects of the chinese steel making industry including the mining and processing of iron ore and other forms of iron which can be used to produce iron concentrate fines pellets or sinter to date we have been engaged in iron ore processing and the production of iron ore concentrate in the peoples republic of china prc through our variable interest entity vie china jinxin and through the production of dri by our subsidiary china huaxin china jinxin is currently in the process of upgrading its zhuolu facilities and adding the equipment necessary to produce dri on january   we acquired a direct reduced iron dri production facility in haixing county hebei province we completed trial production at this facility and expected to commence commercial production in may  however as a result of environmental initiatives by government authorities in china starting in june  we began upgrading the dri facilities by converting the existing coalgas station systems to liquefied natural gas lng station systems the conversion to lng systems will reduce pollutants and produce higher quality dris with less impurities china huaxin has completed the upgrading and resumed trial production from its upgraded dri facilities as a result of our acquisition of target we own all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of real fortune bvi which in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of real fortune holdings limited a hong kong limited company real fortune hk which in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of zhangjiakou tongda mining technologies service co ltd a chinese limited company china tongda real fortune bvi was established in the bvi in september  to serve as an intermediate holding company real fortune hk was established in hk in april  china tongda was established in the prc in august  and in august  the local government of the prc issued a certificate of approval regarding the foreign ownership of china tongda by real fortune hk china jinxin our operating affiliate was established in the prc in december  we have effective control of the management and operations of china jinxin an iron ore processing and high grade iron ore concentrate producer with a production line located in zhuolu county zhangjiakou city hebei province china through a series of agreements among china tongda china jinxin and its shareholders referred to as vie agreements china jinxin has an annual capacity of approximately  tons under the vie agreements china tongda is entitled to receive the pretax profits of china jinxin table of contents on january   china tongda acquired all of the outstanding shares of china huaxin china huaxin produces direct reduced iron dri at its dri production facility the dri facility in haixing county hebei province about  km from the nearest port using advanced reduction rotary kiln technology with iron sand as the principal raw material china huaxin imports iron sands from new zealand australia indonesia and the philippines the total amount expended to construct the dri facility inclusive of both hard and soft costs was approximately  rmb or  million china huaxin completed trial production in may  however due to environmental initiatives by government authorities in china starting in june  china huaxin began upgrading the dri facilities by converting the existing coalgas station systems to liquefied natural gas lng station systems in the end of  china huaxin completed the upgrading and resumed trial production from its upgraded dri facilities unlike china jinxin which we control through the vie agreements china huaxin is directly owned by china tongda our wholly owned subsidiary to date we have received only temporary manufacturing licenses granted by the agencies of the local government which allowed us to process ore that we obtained from zhuolu mine the mine on which our facility is located or other third parties our ability to profit from our facility in zhuolu is dependent upon our ability to extract and process iron ore from the zhuolu mine and sell the output for a price that enables us to profit to date all of our sales from this facility have been made to a single customer we entered into a tenyear contract with this customer which expires in january  pursuant to this agreement we agreed to sell the customer hsg all of the output from our zhuolu facility which it agreed to purchase the price paid to us by hsg is to be determined by hsg in light of the quality of our product and market prices and is to be such that it results in a proper margin to us thus our ability to profit from our current production facility at the zhuolu mine over the next few years will be determined by the prices we receive from hsg we cannot guarantee that hsg will not offer a price below what it pays to the companys competitors the lower price will reduce our profit margin however if we are not satisfied with the price set by hsg we can attempt to renegotiate the price in an effort to obtain a higher price from hsg we have yet to deliver iron ore concentrate we produced in the fourth quarter of  we are continuing to negotiate with hsg to resolve our dispute over the price to be paid for our output net sales for the year ended december   were  of which  were from china huaxin and  were from consulting services performed by china tongda as compared to net sales of  for the year ended december   from china huaxins trial production all mineral resources in china are owned by the state thus our ability to obtain iron ore depends upon our ability to obtain mineral licenses from the relevant state authorities purchase ore from another party that has mining rights or import ore from outside of china it is generally not feasible to transport iron ore any significant distance before processing we believe as evidenced by our shareholders willingness to finance the construction of our zhuolu facilities there is sufficient iron ore in the vicinity of our zhuolu facilities to enable us to operate them at a profit nevertheless we have yet to obtain long term rights to any iron mine and there is no assurance we will be able to do so although we extracted iron ore from the zhuolu mine where our production facilities are located we do not have the right to do so and can be subjected to various fines and penalties however since we paid geological survey fees on behalf of the local government so it could process applications related to the right to mine the zhuolu mine and has not received any challenges from any authorities regarding our mining activities we believe that even if fines and penalties are assessed against us in the future the amount should be negotiable with the authorities if we are unable to obtain mining rights to the zhuolu mine we will have to acquire iron ore from third parties the failure to obtain iron ore for processing at all or on reasonably acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results we have not yet receive the official mining rights to extract accordingly we made a provision for fixed assets impairment for all the mine extracting and broken equipment and machinery weve been negotiating a sale agreement with a new customer for china jinxin and expecting the agreement to be signed in mid of  to date we have been dependent upon cash advances from our shareholders if we were not to obtain sufficient iron ore for processing it is likely our operations would cease unless our shareholders continue to provide sufficient funds to maintain our plant and equipment until such time as our operations could be resumed we may seek to grow our operations by acquiring mining rights and other production facilities the cash necessary to acquire such rights may exceed that which we have on hand in such event we may seek to raise the necessary cash through bank loans or the issuance of equity to the vendors of such rights our shareholders or third parties there can be no assurance such cash will be available to us on reasonable terms if at all the prices and terms at which we issue equity securities and the performance of any rights or facilities we acquire will determine whether we operate profitably table of contents the profitability of the mining industry in china and of our company in particular is dependent upon the demand for iron ore and other metals within china this demand in turn is influenced by general economic factors such as the rate of growth of the economy and of the construction industry there can be no assurance that china will return to the rapid rates of growth it experienced in the recent past if the rate of growth of the chinese economy remains low or were to slow down demand for iron and steel could fall adversely impacting our operations results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and  dollar percentage increase increase   of sales   of sales decrease decrease sales              cost of goods sold           gross income loss           operating expenses           loss from

ore concentrate we commenced production of iron ore at our zhuolu facility in march  however we ceased production from september  to march  because the local government implemented an energy saving and emission reduction plan to reduce local power consumption we installed power equipment to enable us to maintain a stable power supply to our production equipment and management believes the energy saving and emission reduction plan is onetime event and disruptions to our access to energy will not have a material impact on our production in the future we also ceased production in december  due to a pricing dispute with our major customer and to upgrade our production facilities construction for china jinxins dri facility upgrade was complete as of the date of this report and we are currently in the final stages of adjusting the equipment and making certain modification to the facility after relevant authoritys inspection and testing table of contents we acquired a new subsidiary china huaxin in january  through which we own a direct reduced iron production facility which was recently constructed china huaxin completed trial production and expected to commence commercial production in may  however as a result of environmental initiatives by government authorities in china starting in june  china huaxin has been upgrading the dri facilities by converting the existing coalgas station systems to liquefied natural gas lng station systems the conversion to lng systems will reduce pollutants and produce higher quality dris with less impurities china huaxin has completed the upgrading and resumed trial production from its upgraded dri facilities net sales for the year ended december   were  of which  were from china huaxin and  were from consulting services performed by china tongda as compared net sales of  for the year ended december   from china huaxins trial production cost of goods sold cost of goods cogs sold consists primarily of fuel power direct material direct labor depreciation of production plant items and equipment and accrual of the mining rights which are attributable to the production of iron ore iron ore concentrate and dri cogs for china huaxins trial production were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   gross income loss gross income for the year ended december   was  as compared to a gross loss of  for the year ended december   due to our low sales volume low unit selling prices resulting from the sale of semifinished products and high cogs during the trial production period in  operating expenses operating expenses consist mainly of employee salaries and welfare business meeting and promotion expense depreciation and amortization of items not associated with production utilities and audit and legal expenses operating expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the period in  a decrease of  or  which was mainly due to the absence of trial production related expenses and absence of impairment provision for fixed assets in the year ended december   compared to  of trial production related expenses and  impairment provision for fixed assets incurred in  other expenses other expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the  period the  decrease in other expenses was mainly due to decreased interest expense of  and no loss from the disposal of fixed assets for the year ended december   compared with  of interest expense and a  loss on disposal of fixed assets for the  period net loss we had a net loss of  for the year ended december   compared to net loss of  for the year ended december   the reduction in our net loss year over year results from the absence of trial production expenses and the absence of an impairment provision for fixed assets liquidity and capital resources our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent upon our ability to obtain iron ore and iron sands to process and to maintain the permits necessary to process such ore at our current facilities neither of which is assured if we cannot obtain iron ore and iron sands to process or are no longer able to process ore and sands we would be dependent upon cash infusions from our current shareholders or third parties in the form of loans or equity contributions or a combination thereof to maintain our facilities until we can resume operations one shareholder has indicated she will continue to fund china jinxin although there is no written agreement in place and china jinxin currently owes  million to the shareholder in addition china huaxin borrowed  million from three of our shareholders one of whom is the individual who funded china jinxin and who has loaned  million to china huaxin another of whom is our ceo and who has loaned  million and the third of whom is a shareholder and senior officer who has loaned  million despite such commitments there is no assurance adequate cash will be available from current shareholders or from third parties and if it is available what the terms of any loan or investment might be if we are unable to obtain the funding required we may have to curtail or cease our operations we have no specific plans understandings or agreements with respect to the raising of such funds and we may seek to raise the required capital by the issuance of equity or debt securities or by other means since we have no such arrangements or plans currently in effect our inability to raise funds may have a severe negative impact on our ability to become a viable company table of contents other than current construction in progress which will be funded by one of our shareholders we do not anticipate significant cash expenditures in the immediate future on our current production facilities nevertheless we may require working capital once we resume production at our facilities certain of our shareholders have verbally agreed to continue to provide cash to satisfy our working capital needs however in the future we intend to continue the expansion of operations by acquiring new production facilities and mines the acquisitions will be paid for with cash or our equity securities or combinations of both failure to obtain such financing could have a material adverse effect on our business expansion the issuance and sale our equity securities would dilute the interest of our current shareholders further there is no guarantee of the terms on which such an issuance would occur if at all or whether such terms would be favorable to our current shareholders as

description of business   adamant dri processing and minerals group “adamant’ or “the company” or “group” is a nevada corporation incorporated in july  and successor by merger to uhf incorporated a delaware corporation “uhf”     the company produces direct reduced iron “dri” using advanced reduction rotary kiln technology with iron ore as the principal raw material ‘reduced iron’ derives its name from the chemical change that iron ore undergoes when it is heated in a furnace at high temperatures in the presence of hydrocarbonrich gasses ‘direct reduction’ refers to processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron below the melting point of iron   uhf was the successor to uhf incorporated a michigan corporation “uhf michigan” as a result of domicile merger effected on december     on june   uhf entered into and closed a share exchange agreement or the target share exchange agreement with target acquisitions i inc a delaware corporation “target” and the stockholders of target the “target stockholders” pursuant to which uhf acquired  of the issued and outstanding capital stock of target for  shares of uhf’s common stock and one share of uhf’s series a convertible preferred stock convertible into an additional  shares of common stock  since uhf’s certificate of incorporation only authorized the issuance of  shares of common stock uhf did not have sufficient authorized but unissued shares of common stock to complete the acquisition of target so the board of directors authorized the issuance to one of the target stockholders one share of series a convertible preferred stock convertible into  shares of common stock at such time as uhf amended its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock or merged with and into another corporation which had sufficient shares of authorized but unissued shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion following the closing of the share exchange uhf had outstanding  shares of common stock and one share of series a convertible preferred stock which was converted into  common shares on august     for accounting purposes the share exchange transaction with target and the target stockholders was treated as a reverse acquisition with target as the acquirer and uhf as the acquired party   the shares issued to target’s shareholders were accounted for as a recapitalization of target and were retroactively restated for the periods presented because after the share exchange target’s shareholders owned the majority of uhf’s outstanding shares and exercised significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the consolidated entity and uhf was a nonoperating shell with nominal net assets prior to the acquisition pursuant to securities and exchange commission “sec” rules this is considered a capital transaction in substance rather than a business combination   on july   the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with uhf pursuant to which uhf merged with and into adamant with adamant as the surviving entity the “merger” as a result of which each outstanding share of common stock of uhf at the effective time of the merger was converted into one share of the common stock of adamant and the outstanding share of series a preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock the merger was effected on august     as a result of the acquisition of target and uhf the company now owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of real fortune bvi which in turn owns all of the issued and

likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes if any tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination interest associated with unrecognized tax

measured at the date that the commitment for performance by the counterparty has been reached or the counterpartys performance is complete   earnings loss per share eps   basic eps is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period diluted eps is computed similar to basic eps except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all the potential common shares warrants and stock options had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive diluted eps is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options and warrants were converted or exercised dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for the outstanding options and warrants and the ifconverted method for the outstanding convertible instruments under the treasury stock method options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period or at the time of issuance if later and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period under the ifconverted method outstanding convertible instruments are assumed to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the period or at the time of issuance if later    table of contents   segment reporting

mineral rights from the relevant state authorities purchase ore from another party that has mining rights from the state or import ore from outside the prc it is generally not feasible to transport iron ore any significant distance before processing the company has yet to obtain long term rights to any iron mine and there is no assurance the company will be able to do so although the company has extracted iron ore from the zhuolu mine on which the company’s production facilities are located the company does not have the right to do so and can be subjected to various fines and penalties the company is not able to determine the amount of fines and penalties at the current stage however the company believes the fines and penalties are negotiable with the authorities if the company is not able to obtain mining rights to the zhuolu mine in the future the company will have to cease mining operations at the zhuolu mine and the company will seek to acquire iron ore from third parties the failure to obtain iron ore reserves for processing at all or on reasonably acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results    subsequent event   on april   the company issued a press release announcing the restart of production following a year production modernization period the production was limited to test runs and no revenue was accrued during the first quarter of    item     managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   overview   we seek to profit by participating in various aspects of the chinese steel making industry including the mining and processing of iron ore and other forms of iron which can be used to produce iron concentrate fines pellets or sinter  to date we have been engaged in iron ore processing and the production of iron ore concentrate in the people’s republic of china “prc” through our variable interest entity ‘vie’ china jinxin and through the production of dri by our subsidiary china huaxin   china jinxin’s dri facility upgrade was almost completed as of the date of this report and is currently in the final stage of adjusting equipment and making certain modification to the facility after relevant authority’s inspection and testing    table of contents   on january   we acquired a direct reduced iron “dri” production facility in haixing county hebei province  we completed trial production at this facility and expected to commence commercial production in may  however as a result of environmental initiatives by government authorities in china starting in june  we began upgrading the dri facilities by converting the existing coalgas station systems to liquefied natural gas “lng” station systems the conversion to lng systems will reduce pollutants and produce higher quality dris with less impurities china huaxin has completed the upgrading and resumed trial production from its upgraded dri facilities china huaxin is currently doing equipment debugging and adjustment and expects to resume official production in mid   we own all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of real fortune bvi which in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of real fortune holdings limited a hong kong limited company “real fortune hk” which in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of zhangjiakou tongda mining technologies service co ltd a chinese limited company “china tongda” real fortune bvi was established in the bvi in september  to serve as an intermediate holding company  real fortune hk was established in hk in april  china tongda was established in the prc in august  and in august  the local government of the prc issued a certificate of approval regarding the foreign ownership of china tongda by real fortune hk  china jinxin one of our operating affiliates was established in the prc in december     we have effective control of the management and operations of china jinxin an iron ore processing and high grade iron ore concentrate producer with a production line located in zhuolu county zhangjiakou city hebei province china through a series of agreements among china tongda china jinxin and its shareholders referred to as “vie agreements” china jinxin has an annual capacity of approximately  tons  under the vie agreements china tongda is entitled to receive the pretax profits of china jinxin     on january   china tongda acquired all of the outstanding shares of china huaxin china huaxin produces direct reduced iron dri at its dri production facility the “dri facility” in haixing county hebei province about  km from the nearest port using advanced reduction rotary kiln technology with iron sand as the principal raw material china huaxin imports iron sands from new zealand australia indonesia and the philippines the total amount expended to construct the dri facility inclusive of both hard and soft costs was approximately  rmb or  million  china huaxin completed trial production in may  however due to environmental initiatives by government authorities in china starting in june  china huaxin began upgrading the dri facilities by converting the existing coalgas station systems to liquefied natural gas “lng” station systems in the end of  china huaxin completed the upgrading and resumed trial production from its upgraded dri facilities unlike china jinxin which we control through the vie agreements china huaxin is directly owned by china tongda our wholly owned subsidiary   to date we have received only temporary manufacturing licenses granted by the agencies of the local government which allowed us to process ore that we obtained from zhuolu mine the mine on which our facility is located or other third parties   our ability to profit from our facility in zhuolu is dependent upon our ability to extract and process iron ore from the zhuolu mine and sell the output for a price that enables us to profit to date all of our sales from this facility have been made to a single customer we entered into a tenyear contract with this customer which expires in january  pursuant to this agreement we agreed to sell the customer hsg all of the output from our zhuolu facility which it agreed to purchase the price paid to us by hsg is to be determined by hsg in light of the quality of our product and market prices and is to be such that it results in a proper margin to us thus our ability to profit from our current production facility at the zhuolu mine over the next few years will be determined by the prices we receive from hsg we cannot guarantee that hsg will not offer a price below what it pays to the company’s competitors the lower price will reduce our profit margin however if we are not satisfied with the price set by hsg we can attempt to renegotiate the price in an effort to obtain a higher price from hsg we have yet to deliver iron ore concentrate we produced in the fourth quarter of  we are continuing to negotiate with hsg to resolve our dispute over the price to be paid for our output    there was no production and sales for the three months ended march   and  china huaxin is currently doing the equipment debugging and adjustment and expected the official production in mid    table of contents   all mineral resources in china are owned by the state thus our ability to obtain iron ore depends upon our ability to obtain mineral licenses from the relevant state authorities purchase ore from another party that has mining rights or import ore from outside of china it is generally not feasible to transport iron ore any significant distance before processing we believe as evidenced by our shareholders’ willingness to finance the construction of our zhuolu facilities there is sufficient iron ore in the vicinity of our zhuolu facilities to enable us to operate them at a profit nevertheless we have yet to obtain long term rights to any iron mine and there is no assurance we will be able to do so although we extracted iron ore from the zhuolu mine where our production facilities are located we do not have the right to do so and can be subjected to various fines and penalties however since we paid geological survey fees on behalf of the local government so it could process applications related to the right to mine the zhuolu mine and has not received any challenges from any authorities regarding our mining activities we believe that even if fines and penalties are assessed against us in the future the amount should be negotiable with the authorities if we are unable to obtain mining rights to the zhuolu mine we will have to acquire iron ore from third parties the failure to obtain iron ore for processing at all or on reasonably acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results we have not yet receive the official mining rights to extract accordingly we made a provision for fixed assets impairment for all the mine extracting and broken equipment and machinery we’ve been negotiating a sale agreement with a new customer for china jinxin and expecting the agreement to be signed in mid   to date we have been dependent upon cash advances from our shareholders if we were not to obtain sufficient iron ore for processing it is likely our operations would cease unless our shareholders continue to provide sufficient funds to maintain our plant and equipment until such time as our operations could be resumed   we may seek to grow our operations by acquiring mining rights and other production facilities the cash necessary to acquire such rights may exceed that which we have on hand in such event we may seek to raise the necessary cash through bank loans or the issuance of equity to the vendors of such rights our shareholders or third parties there can be no assurance such cash will be available to us on reasonable terms if at all the prices and terms at which we issue equity securities and the performance of any rights or facilities we acquire will determine whether we operate profitably   the profitability of the mining industry in china and of our company in particular is dependent upon the demand for iron ore and other metals within china this demand in turn is influenced by general economic factors such as the rate of growth of the economy and of the construction industry there can be no assurance that china will return to the rapid rates of growth it experienced in the recent past if the rate of growth of the chinese economy remains low or were to slow down demand for iron and steel could fall adversely impacting our operations     results of operations   comparison of the three months ended march   and                        dollar   percentage         of sales       of

ceased production from september  to march  because the local government implemented an “energy saving and emission reduction plan” to reduce local power consumption we installed power equipment to enable us to maintain a stable power supply to our production equipment and management believes the energy saving and emission reduction plan is onetime event and disruptions to our access to energy will not have a material impact on our production in the future we also ceased production in december  due to a pricing dispute with our major customer and to upgrade our production facilities construction for china jinxin’s dri facility upgrade was complete as of the date of this report and we are currently in the final stages of adjusting the equipment and making certain modification to the facility after relevant authority’s inspection and testing   we acquired a new subsidiary china huaxin in january  through which we own a direct reduced iron production facility which was recently

in our net loss results from the increased operating and other expenses   liquidity and capital resources   our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent upon our ability to obtain iron ore and iron sands to process and to maintain the permits necessary to process such ore at our current facilities neither of which is assured if we cannot obtain iron ore and iron sands to process or are no longer able to process ore and sands we would be dependent upon cash infusions from our current shareholders or third parties in the form of loans or equity contributions or a combination thereof to maintain our facilities until we can resume operations one shareholder has indicated she will continue to fund china jinxin although there is no written agreement in place and china jinxin currently owes her  million in addition china huaxin borrowed  million from three of our shareholders one of whom is the individual who funded china jinxin and who has loaned  million to china huaxin

will be available from current shareholders or from third parties and if it is available what the terms of any loan or investment might be if we are unable to obtain the funding required we may have to curtail or cease our operations we have no specific plans understandings or agreements with respect to the raising of such funds and we may seek to raise the required capital by the issuance of equity or debt securities or by other means since we have no such arrangements or plans currently in effect our inability to raise funds may have a severe negative impact on our ability to become a viable company     other than current construction in progress which will be funded by one of our shareholders we do not anticipate significant cash expenditures in the immediate future on our current production facilities nevertheless we may require working capital once we resume production at our facilities certain of our shareholders have verbally agreed to continue to provide cash to satisfy our working capital needs however in the future we intend to continue the expansion of operations by acquiring new production facilities and mines the acquisitions will be paid for with cash or our equity securities or combinations of both failure to obtain such financing could have a material adverse effect on our business expansion the issuance and sale our equity securities would dilute the

policies and estimates   our managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which were prepared in accordance with us gaap while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis   emerging growth company   on april   the jobs act was signed into law the jobs act contains provisions that among other things reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies as an “emerging growth company” we may under section ab of the securities act delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards would otherwise apply to private companies we may take advantage of this extended transition period until the first to occur of the date that we i are no longer an emerging growth company or ii affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this extended transition period we elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards until the date we are no longer an emerging growth company or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by securities act section ab upon issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to our financial statements and that has a different effective date for public and private companies we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for nonemerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard the jobs act also provides exemption from auditor reporting on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as required by section b of the sarbanes oxley act of    basis of presentations   our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap and the requirements of regulation sx promulgated by the

addition we have refused to sell our iron ore concentrate to our sole customer because of the low price offered for our product the price of iron ore concentrate is still in decline these conditions raise substantial doubt as to whether we can continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty one shareholder has indicated she will continue to fund china jinxin though there is no written agreement in place and the company currently owes  million to the shareholder in addition china huaxin borrowed  million from three shareholders and borrowed  million from certain companies owned by its major shareholder despite such commitments there is no assurance that adequate cash will be available from current

liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period

procedures   a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures    management of adamant dri processing and minerals group is responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the company files or submits under the securities exchange act of  the “exchange act” is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms in addition the disclosure controls and procedures must ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required financial and other required disclosures   at march   an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de of the securities exchange act of  the “exchange act” was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures they concluded that at march   such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective  this was due to our limited resources including the absence of a financial staff with accounting and financial expertise and deficiencies in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected our disclosure controls and that may be considered to be “material weaknesses”   we plan to designate individuals responsible for identifying reportable developments and to implement procedures designed to remediate the material weakness by focusing additional attention and resources in our internal accounting functions however the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively   b changes in internal control over financial reporting    there have been no changes in our internal
