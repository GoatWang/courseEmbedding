management wealth management  minute read happiness  planning a comprehensive look happiness  planning a comprehensive look wealth management  minute read most people think of estate planning as the process of arranging their affairs in anticipation of death and that obviously is the main focus of estate planning but done properly estate planning can help increase our own happiness we all want to be happy that seems to be why we do everything isnt it its especially true with respect to our financial lives and yet some of us cant figure out how to get there there have been many books published on the science of happiness particularly in the last  to  years and although none of them answer the question definitively the findings they cite give us some signposts about financial happiness what impacts our happiness many factors contribute to our lack of financial happiness to begin with our perception of what we need to be happy dictates how we behave and how we pursue our goals however it turns out that our perceptions are often faultywe think we have far more control over future events than we do our memories tend to be faulty our brains after having experienced something will fill in “facts” that didnt actually exist with the result that we build a past that never happenedlack of true imagination is common we find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think want or feel differently than we do nowwe treasure our own uniqueness we see ourselves as better more intelligent more effective in business or even worse more selfish but never average as a result we fail to learn from the experiences of others money and happiness we have a difficult relationship with money we have been told that money alone does not equal happiness however it is possible that in some cases money can add to happinessthe national academy of sciences reported that peoples emotional wellbeing increases along with their income but only up to about  per year on the other hand it also seems that incremental increases in income once a person is safely above the poverty level or perhaps above the annual  level do not result in incremental increases in happiness studies of other countries levels of happiness bear this out people in latin american countries for instance where average income levels are much lower are more or less on par in the happiness department with americans who have the highest per capita incomeit may be that americans are not as happy as their income level would suggest because we live in a culture of stress we are overworked and our consumer culture like our biology posits that feeling good is the main purpose in life rather than a byproduct of living right planning our way to happiness so what can we do with this information because selfcontrol is so critical for happiness it would seem that indepth planning for your financial life is an important component to happiness if you have adequate information about your financial situation and can use that information to formulate a road map for where you want to go then you are likely to have greater autonomy or control and therefore may have a greater potential to be happiergood planning is not merely “financial” planning this is true because money alone does not make a person happier rather solid planning is built on a basis of solid discovery that is to formulate a plan that may truly improve your life you must first discover those key goals and issues that really motivate you and then compare your existing financial situation against these goals to see how prepared you are to meet those goals once youve uncovered what is most important to you you can begin to formulate a plan that really makes sense and that can potentially lead you to greater happinessthis kind of planning cant be done on a website or with software it requires soulsearching and possibly some help from professionals who know how to ask the right questions and interpret the answers but the reward for doing it the right way just might be a greater degree of happiness ready set plan put in more tangible terms we strongly recommend planning that proceeds in the following steps note that the first four steps arent really planning at all but rather discovery steps that are necessary before any meaningful planning can take placeidentify your key goals and issues make them specific and start with the nonfinancial ones one author identified seven factors that included things like family and personal relationships meaningful work friends and values as being key drivers of happiness think of those kinds of goals first what might retirement look like to you will you be the kind of person who will always have to work — not for the money but to keep you from going crazy if maintaining community and personal relationships is important to you do you really need that second house let personal valuesbased decisions drive the financial ones complete your own personal balance sheet having a personal and detailed balance sheet lets you see at a glance what your total financial picture looks like including assets that you might not otherwise consider like life insurance and real estateidentify your risk sensitivity weve now endured the great recession and we know viscerally how that feels in light of that experience what is your emotional reaction to risk this is less about how a financial professional might describe it and more about your reaction to itassemble a list of your estate planning documentsbegin the planning process with all this

new retirement a new investment plan for a new retirement retirement  minute read five ways you may want to adjust your retirement plan as people live longer more active years thanks to medical advances more people are living longer and with an eye on a healthy lifestyle thats terrific news for everyone but a longer more active life also means rethinking traditional views of your needs for retirement and that should include a critical look at how your portfolio is put togetherit used to be that as individuals and investors got close to and entered retirement they changed their portfolios to have less exposure to equities and more to fixed income in order to protect what was built over the years drew denning retirement strategist for wells fargo advisors notes that now however you may need retirement income for  or more years and he adds that with an inflation assumption of  your costs will double in  yearsso how do you help ensure you stay as financially healthy as you are physically fit for all those wonderful years of retirement denning outlines five suggestions to rethink the way you invest in retirement  reconsider your risk for starters denning advises that you revisit your risk tolerance for those transitioning from working to retirement this advice is even more important “the loss of a regular paycheck can cause more aggressive investors to become even more nervous when a market correction occurs if you cannot either emotionally or financially withstand a market correction without withdrawing from the market then your portfolio is too risky” says denningthis doesnt mean however that you should move to  bonds “keeping a healthy dose of exposure to stocks andor equities can help a portfolio keep pace with inflation” he adds  keep a cash reserve most people know the importance of keeping an emergency fund during your working years but what about when youre drawing down on existing funds conventional advice about establishing a cash reserve bears repeating according to denning when a market decline occurs or when you have an emergency expense your cash reserve can be a resource not only financially but also emotionally denning points out that analysis shows that this reserve should cover anywhere from one to three years of essential expenses  adjust your habits for market conditions “consider using adaptable spending if your budget allows” counsels denning “when your portfolio declines in value reduce your planned withdrawals and when the market increases increase your withdrawals or spending” this approach he adds “can dramatically increase the longterm sustainability of your portfolio”  focus on fixed income although its important to maintain an allocation of stocks bonds and cash in your portfolio pay special attention to your bond allocation denning advises in todays lowinterestrate environment many analysts are predicting a slow and steady increase in rates during the next five to  years while increasing rates are desirable to retirees it can also have a negative impact on the value of your bond portfolio“for instance if interest rates rise by  a bond portfolio with a year duration will decrease in value by ” denning says a possible solution “i would suggest selecting a bond portfolio with a twotothreeyear duration where a  increase in rates would only result in a  to  decline in the value of the portfolio”  build your health care plan as life spans and the number of years you spend in retirement increase you likely will be subject to a corresponding increase in health care expenses according to a  report from healthview insights the average lifetime health care expenses for a yearold healthy couple retiring in  and covered by medicare parts b d and a supplemental insurance policy will be more than  once outofpocket medical expenses are added into the equationregarding this somewhat sobering statistic denning advises to pay attention to your health and address any medical issues before they have a chance to become major concernsits not your parents retirement — the same strategies that worked for them may not be right for you if youre looking at spending  or

balanced approach wealth management  minute read dont let your focus on building and preserving wealth negatively impact your family relationships and personal health if youre in your prime earning years your focus is likely on building the wealth you will need to live well in retirement americans are living longer and health care costs are rising investing enough money to provide sufficient income to sustain your current lifestyle can help pave the way for a more secure retirement but too much focus on meeting future income needs can be stressful particularly when you are in your s s and s and may be facing many family commitments how do you find a balancestart by realizing that its normal to feel a nervewracking pull between enjoying your life today and accumulating sufficient wealth to cover all your expenses in retirement “thinking about how much income you will need in retirement can be very daunting” says tracie mcmillion cfa head of global asset allocation at wells fargo investment institutefor most people prime working years are also prime family years — the time when children are growing up and older family members may begin to need medical care having a singleminded focus on wealthbuilding at the expense of family priorities can cause major stress which can even impact your health more than just an annoyance chronic stress raises the risk of heart disease high blood pressure diabetes depression anxiety disorder and other illnessesburying your head in the sand isnt the answer either “people tend to focus more on the present than the future” says margie e lachman phd professor of psychology and director of the lifespan initiative on healthy aging and lifespan lab at brandeis universitywhile it can be fun to live in the moment the secret to building wealth without damaging your health lies in taking a balanced approach here are six ways to find a worklife balance that allows you to enjoy today while saving for tomorrow  dont wait if you don’t think that you will be able to meet your income needs in retirement dont waste time beating yourself up about it meet with your financial team now to take immediate action you may want to consider whether you are accumulating wealth in the most taxefficient accounts and also revisit your regular expenditures having a clear plan in place can help you increase opportunities available to you when you retire  rethink retirement income when interest rates are high many retired investors look to bond portfolios for income but with sustained low interest rates those accumulating wealth for retirement as well as those already in retirement may need to consider other avenues to generate their income“sometimes fear of risk makes people too conservative with retirement savings they dont want to lose what theyve worked so hard for” mcmillion says “but you do want to get a good return on your moneyrdquo because people are living longer in retirement you may want to keep exposure to equities and other growth investments even as you get closer to retirement a portfolio that relies solely on fixed income may not be able to keep up with inflation “talk to your investment specialist to determine which strategies align with your specific needs” offers mcmillion  involve your family take advantage of opportunities to talk with your family about finances when your children are young it can help to explain why its so important for you to save for the future and that sometimes shortterm sacrifices are necessary to make that happen understanding the familys financial realities may help lower everyones stress levels when you occasionally have to make the choice to skip a little league game or gymnastics meet in order to put in some extra hours at work by having regular conversations about budgeting and investing your children will be well informed as they mature and more prepared for their own financial futures  take care of your health neglecting selfcare not only interferes with your quality of life but can also make your postretirement health care costs skyrocket protect your health and your nest egg by eating a healthy diet exercising most days of the week maintaining a healthy weight getting regular health checkups and staying up to date on vaccinations these things do take time and effort but they can have big payoffs later in life  make your money work as hard as you do business owners often have their company’s balance sheet top of mind as they build their business but once the business is passed along their personal balance sheet will need to be structured to sustain them as always diversification and asset placement are key strategies to help plan for growth and income in a portfolio your investment professional can help you evaluate your current allocation against your anticipated needs and recommend adjustments to help keep you on track  think beyond dollars investing cash during your prime earning years is important of course but its also essential to plan in a more holistic way as well “make investments in the future — not just monetary ones but also in relationships health career and education” lachman says “they all can pay

management wealth management  minute read happiness  planning a comprehensive look happiness  planning a comprehensive look wealth management  minute read most people think of estate planning as the process of arranging their affairs in anticipation of death and that obviously is the main focus of estate planning but done properly estate planning can help increase our own happiness we all want to be happy that seems to be why we do everything isnt it its especially true with respect to our financial lives and yet some of us cant figure out how to get there there have been many books published on the science of happiness particularly in the last  to  years and although none of them answer the question definitively the findings they cite give us some signposts about financial happiness what impacts our happiness many factors contribute to our lack of financial happiness to begin with our perception of what we need to be happy dictates how we behave and how we pursue our goals however it turns out that our perceptions are often faultywe think we have far more control over future events than we do our memories tend to be faulty our brains after having experienced something will fill in “facts” that didnt actually exist with the result that we build a past that never happenedlack of true imagination is common we find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think want or feel differently than we do nowwe treasure our own uniqueness we see ourselves as better more intelligent more effective in business or even worse more selfish but never average as a result we fail to learn from the experiences of others money and happiness we have a difficult relationship with money we have been told that money alone does not equal happiness however it is possible that in some cases money can add to happinessthe national academy of sciences reported that peoples emotional wellbeing increases along with their income but only up to about  per year on the other hand it also seems that incremental increases in income once a person is safely above the poverty level or perhaps above the annual  level do not result in incremental increases in happiness studies of other countries levels of happiness bear this out people in latin american countries for instance where average income levels are much lower are more or less on par in the happiness department with americans who have the highest per capita incomeit may be that americans are not as happy as their income level would suggest because we live in a culture of stress we are overworked and our consumer culture like our biology posits that feeling good is the main purpose in life rather than a byproduct of living right planning our way to happiness so what can we do with this information because selfcontrol is so critical for happiness it would seem that indepth planning for your financial life is an important component to happiness if you have adequate information about your financial situation and can use that information to formulate a road map for where you want to go then you are likely to have greater autonomy or control and therefore may have a greater potential to be happiergood planning is not merely “financial” planning this is true because money alone does not make a person happier rather solid planning is built on a basis of solid discovery that is to formulate a plan that may truly improve your life you must first discover those key goals and issues that really motivate you and then compare your existing financial situation against these goals to see how prepared you are to meet those goals once youve uncovered what is most important to you you can begin to formulate a plan that really makes sense and that can potentially lead you to greater happinessthis kind of planning cant be done on a website or with software it requires soulsearching and possibly some help from professionals who know how to ask the right questions and interpret the answers but the reward for doing it the right way just might be a greater degree of happiness ready set plan put in more tangible terms we strongly recommend planning that proceeds in the following steps note that the first four steps arent really planning at all but rather discovery steps that are necessary before any meaningful planning can take placeidentify your key goals and issues make them specific and start with the nonfinancial ones one author identified seven factors that included things like family and personal relationships meaningful work friends and values as being key drivers of happiness think of those kinds of goals first what might retirement look like to you will you be the kind of person who will always have to work — not for the money but to keep you from going crazy if maintaining community and personal relationships is important to you do you really need that second house let personal valuesbased decisions drive the financial ones complete your own personal balance sheet having a personal and detailed balance sheet lets you see at a glance what your total financial picture looks like including assets that you might not otherwise consider like life insurance and real estateidentify your risk sensitivity weve now endured the great recession and we know viscerally how that feels in light of that experience what is your emotional reaction to risk this is less about how a financial professional might describe it and more about your reaction to itassemble a list of your estate planning documentsbegin the planning process with all this

prime earning years your focus is likely on building the wealth you will need to live well in retirement americans are living longer and health care costs are rising investing enough money to provide sufficient income to sustain your current lifestyle can help pave the way for a more secure retirement but too much focus on meeting future income needs can be stressful particularly when you are in your s s and s and may be facing many family commitments how do you find a balancestart by realizing that its normal to feel a nervewracking pull between enjoying your life today and accumulating sufficient wealth to cover all your expenses in retirement “thinking about how much income you will need in retirement can be very daunting” says tracie mcmillion cfa head of global asset allocation at wells fargo investment institutefor most people prime working years are also prime family years — the time when children are growing up and older family members may begin to need medical care having a singleminded focus on wealthbuilding at the expense of family priorities can cause major stress which can even impact your health more than just an annoyance chronic stress raises the risk of heart disease high blood pressure diabetes depression anxiety disorder and other illnessesburying your head in the sand isnt the answer either “people tend to focus more on the present than the future” says margie e lachman phd professor of psychology and director of the lifespan initiative on healthy aging and lifespan lab at brandeis universitywhile it can be fun to live in the moment the secret to building wealth without damaging your health lies in taking a balanced approach here are six ways to find a worklife balance that allows you to enjoy today while saving for tomorrow  dont wait if you don’t think that you will be able to meet your income needs in retirement dont waste time beating yourself up about it meet with your financial team now to take immediate action you may want to consider whether you are accumulating wealth in the most taxefficient accounts and also revisit your regular expenditures having a clear plan in place can help you increase opportunities available to you when you retire  rethink retirement income when interest rates are high many retired investors look to bond portfolios for income but with sustained low interest rates those accumulating wealth for retirement as well as those already in retirement may need to consider other avenues to generate their income“sometimes fear of risk makes people too conservative with retirement savings they dont want to lose what theyve worked so hard for” mcmillion says “but you do want to get a good return on your moneyrdquo because people are living longer in retirement you may want to keep exposure to equities and other growth investments even as you get closer to retirement a portfolio that relies solely on fixed income may not be able to keep up with inflation “talk to your investment specialist to determine which strategies align with your specific needs” offers mcmillion  involve your family take advantage of opportunities to talk with your family about finances when your children are young it can help to explain why its so important for you to save for the future and that sometimes shortterm sacrifices are necessary to make that happen understanding the familys financial realities may help lower everyones stress levels when you occasionally have to make the choice to skip a little league game or gymnastics meet in order to put in some extra hours at work by having regular conversations about budgeting and investing your children will be well informed as they mature and more prepared for their own financial futures  take care of your health neglecting selfcare not only interferes with your quality of life but can also make your postretirement health care costs skyrocket protect your health and your nest egg by eating a healthy diet exercising most days of the week maintaining a healthy weight getting regular health checkups and staying up to date on vaccinations these things do take time and effort but they can have big payoffs later in life  make your money work as hard as you do business owners often have their company’s balance sheet top of mind as they build their business but once the business is passed along their personal balance sheet will need to be structured to sustain them as always diversification and asset placement are key strategies to help plan for growth and income in a portfolio your investment professional can help you evaluate your current allocation against your anticipated needs and recommend adjustments to help keep you on track  think beyond dollars investing cash during your prime earning years is important of course but its also essential to plan in a more holistic way as well “make investments in the future — not just monetary ones but also in relationships health career and

as people live longer more active years thanks to medical advances more people are living longer and with an eye on a healthy lifestyle thats terrific news for everyone but a longer more active life also means rethinking traditional views of your needs for retirement and that should include a critical look at how your portfolio is put togetherit used to be that as individuals and investors got close to and entered retirement they changed their portfolios to have less exposure to equities and more to fixed income in order to protect what was built over the years drew denning retirement strategist for wells fargo advisors notes that now however you may need retirement income for  or more years and he adds that with an inflation assumption of  your costs will double in  yearsso how do you help ensure you stay as financially healthy as you are physically fit for all those wonderful years of retirement denning outlines five suggestions to rethink the way you invest in retirement  reconsider your risk for starters denning advises that you revisit your risk tolerance for those transitioning from working to retirement this advice is even more important “the loss of a regular paycheck can cause more aggressive investors to become even more nervous when a market correction occurs if you cannot either emotionally or financially withstand a market correction without withdrawing from the market then your portfolio is too risky” says denningthis doesnt mean however that you should move to  bonds “keeping a healthy dose of exposure to stocks andor equities can help a portfolio keep pace with inflation” he adds  keep a cash reserve most people know the importance of keeping an emergency fund during your working years but what about when youre drawing down on existing funds conventional advice about establishing a cash reserve bears repeating according to denning when a market decline occurs or when you have an emergency expense your cash reserve can be a resource not only financially but also emotionally denning points out that analysis shows that this reserve should cover anywhere from one to three years of essential expenses  adjust your habits for market conditions “consider using adaptable spending if your budget allows” counsels denning “when your portfolio declines in value reduce your planned withdrawals and when the market increases increase your withdrawals or spending” this approach he adds “can dramatically increase the longterm sustainability of your portfolio”  focus on fixed income although its important to maintain an allocation of stocks bonds and cash in your portfolio pay special attention to your bond allocation denning advises in todays lowinterestrate environment many analysts are predicting a slow and steady increase in rates during the next five to  years while increasing rates are desirable to retirees it can also have a negative impact on the value of your bond portfolio“for instance if interest rates rise by  a bond portfolio with a year duration will decrease in value by ” denning says a possible solution “i would suggest selecting a bond portfolio with a twotothreeyear duration where a  increase in rates would only result in a  to  decline in the value of the portfolio”  build your health care plan as life spans and the number of years you spend in retirement increase you likely will be subject to a corresponding increase in health care expenses according to a  report from healthview insights the average lifetime health care expenses for a yearold healthy couple retiring in  and covered by medicare parts b d and a supplemental insurance policy will be more than  once outofpocket medical expenses are added into the equationregarding this somewhat sobering statistic denning advises to pay attention to your health and address any medical issues before they have a chance to become major concernsits not your parents retirement — the same strategies that worked for them may not be right for you if youre looking at spending  or more active years as a retiree taking a thorough look at your investment strategy may help ensure youll be enjoying every one of those years
