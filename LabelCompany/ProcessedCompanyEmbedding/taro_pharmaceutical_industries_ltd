alessandro villadei longshort equity macro value currencies summarytaro is a dominant generic drug manufacturer with a strong balance sheettrades at significant discount to peers despite much higher marginscatalysts include new drug approvals and  billion of drug patents expiring by target price and rationale taro pharmaceutical nysetaro is a recommended buy with a price target of  the company markets over  generic pharmaceutical products in over  countries and is largely known for its dominating influence in the generic dermatology segment over the last three years taro has experienced an ample growth in terms of sales that increased around  and significant margins expansion taro has concentrated its efforts on reducing costs eliminating debt increasing profitability and efficiency and in committing more capital to research and development taro currently has zero debt but a substantial net cash position of around  billion cost of sales accounts for less than  of revenues while sga expense accounts for less than  of revenues decreasing cogs zero debt and low sga expenses significantly reduced the cost structure of taro enabling the company to sell its products at a discount compared to competitors taros commitment to delivering new quality products through rd investments is one of its central priorities in fact the company increased its number of products in preregistration from  in  to  currently taros gross margin is  while its net profit margin is  free cash flow per share is around  and operating margin is around  by running a fairly conservative dcf valuation it can be evinced that taros current intrinsic value is around share additionally there are several catalysts likely to happen that will further improve taros position in the market relevant comps taros most direct competitors are teva pharmaceutical nyseteva akorn nasdaqakrx merck nysemrk and sandoz novartiss nysenvs generic subsidiary all of the aforementioned companies have a substantially higher cost structure more debt and lower margins compared to taro however they are all trading at higher multiples taros pe is  its evebit is  compared to the peers mean of  this indicates that the company is being valued relatively cheaply for each  of ebit ebitev is  compared to peers mean of  catalyst the main catalysts likely to happen with regard to taros operations are taros has committed an increasing amount of capital on developing new medicines and accelerated its anda abbreviated new drug application filings currently  of taros andas are being reviewed by the fda one of which was tentatively approved taro recently filed  andas with the fda of which four were first to file moreover there are multiple products for which either developmental or internal regulatory work is in process in august  novabiotics entered into an exclusive global licensing agreement with taro for the clinical development manufacturing and marketing worldwide of novexatin a product aimed at the treatment of fungal infections of the toenail onychomycosis based on recent studies novexatin will deliver high cure rates and rapid cosmetic benefits with only  days of treatment against  days for the existing topical treatments my view is that the market is not correctly discounting the possibility that novexatin will successfully launch in  in fact from taros latest f report it can be evinced that the company has recently received patents and obtained an exclusive license in the united states and other countries for a variety of products processes and methods of treatment including a novel antifungal compound for onychomycosis that statement which was not reported on the  and  f files gives a major hint about the several steps forward that have been done regarding novexatin revenues are expected to be in the range of  billion once novexatin is launched as the market for such infection is relatively large and given the efficiency of the treatment around  billion worth of drug patents will expire by  which will allow generic drug producers to introduce new and cheaper products in the market investment summary and recommendation taro pharmaceutical is a recommended buy with a price target of  taro pharmaceutical industries ltd taro the company is a sciencebased pharmaceutical company the company markets over  pharmaceutical products in over  countries and is largely known for its dominating influence in the generic dermatology segment over the past three years taro has experienced stable growth along with operating and financial improvements metrics such as sales net income free cash flow profit margins all improved while debt was reduced to zero additionally the company has a meaningful net cash position of  billion albeit the betterment of its operations the market is pricing taro at low valuations company description taro pharmaceutical industries is a multinational sciencebased pharmaceutical company established in israel in  taro is a leader in both the marketing and production of generic drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredient api and sells its products in over  countries the company operates principally through three entities taro pharmaceutical industries ltd taro israel and two of its subsidiaries taro pharmaceuticals inc taro canada and taro usa sun pharmaceutical otcpksmpqy currently controls  of the voting power in taro generic pharmaceuticals are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of brandname drugs and are typically marketed after the patents for brand name drugs have expired generic pharmaceutical products must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceutical products although they are generally sold at prices that are substantially lower than those of their branded counterparts taros generics including semisolids formulations such as creams ointments and other dosage forms such as liquids capsules and tablets are the bedrock of its business and consist of more than  stockkeeping units the majority of which are developed along with taros own api division the therapeutic categories that taros generic drugs cover are dermatology  of sales neuropsychiatric  of sales cardiovascular  of sales antiinflammatory  of sales and others  sales taro manufactures api internally in its manufacturing facilities in israel and canada this allows the company to control the quality of its products and to adopt an efficient and flexible approach to control supply the vertical integrated production process of both generics and api enables the company to have a substantial cost advantage compared to peers operating features over the last three years taro has experienced an ample growth in terms of sales that increased around  and significant margins expansion the company has concentrated its efforts on reducing costs eliminating debt increasing profitability and efficiency and in committing more capital to research and development taros increase in profitability was mainly driven by the introduction of new and high quality drugs in the market and by adjusting the prices of its products due to limited market availability of the respective drugs these pricing adjustments existed given these products were and continue to be of high quality and cost effective to patients compared to alternative treatment options available in the market taros revenue in the united states accounted for  of total consolidated net sales taros market presence is balanced its customer pool is diversified among drug wholesalers store chains mass merchandisers food and retail chains medical care providers and generic drug distributors research and development expenses are allocated  to generic pharmaceuticals  to proprietary pharmaceuticals and delivery systems and  to organic and steroid chemistry over the last two years rd expenses grew  taro increased its number of products in preregistration products that have passed the phase  clinical trials and are awaiting regulatory approval before being launched for sale from  in  to  currently cost of sales accounts for less than  of revenues while sga expense accounts for less than  of revenues moreover the company has lower labor force expenses and higher revenues per employee than most competitors decreasing cogs zero debt and low sga expenses significantly reduced the cost structure of taro enabling the company to sell its products at a discount compared to competitors increasing the companys market share and consequentially its free cash flow and cash position cash flow from operations for the nine months ended december st  increased  compared to the same period last year i expect free cash flow to be around  million for the fiscal year that ended on the st march  increasing at an average annual growth rate of  over the last four years taros gross margin net margin and return on net capital are as follows taros roe is  and by analyzing it under a dupont profile it can be seen that it is driven by a large net profit margin and asset turnover rather than leverage which is essentially not existent competitors not only have a substantially lower roe but such value is principally driven by leverage rather than profitability and efficiency market features in recent years the market for generic pharmaceuticals has grown and is expected to keep expanding at a cagr of  by  the growth has been fueled mainly by the following factors the constant increase in brand drug prices is pushing demand for generics efforts by governments employers thirdparty payers and consumers to control healthcare costs increased acceptance of generic products by physicians pharmacists and consumers the increasing number of pharmaceutical products whose patents have expired and are therefore subject to competition from and substitution by generic equivalents moreover around  billion worth of drug patents will expire by  which will allow generic drug producers to introduce new and cheaper products in the market additionally taro is mainly focused on the market for generic drugs aimed at treating dermatological diseases such as eczema and psoriasis of which around  of the us population is affected such market is a nichehigh barrier to entry market this allows taro to sustain its extremely high margins by exploiting its predominant position as a leader provider of such generic medicines a niche market will not persuade other large competitors that will have to commit extra capital in order to develop new drugs and that will be unable to sell at taros low prices because of their higher cost structure and operating leverage management operatus taros management has been able to execute a strategy focused on delivering high quality products taros commitment to delivering quality products through rd investments is one of its central priorities and management has stated that building a strong and superior quality pipeline will continue to be its focus in  taro received the supply chain excellence award from cardinal health and the rbc  manufacturers award additionally compensation expenses are relatively lower than the companys peers taros board of directors has recently announced that it approved a new  million share repurchase program following the successful completion of the previous  million share repurchase program completed in august  taros management currently intends to retain the majority of its earnings to finance the development of its business in fact the company has recently expanded the production capacity of its israeli and canadian operations to meet anticipated greater demand for taros products in future years in may  taros management announced that it will now make keveyis the first medicine approved by the fda for the treatment of primary hyperkalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis and related variants available to distributors at no cost for the treatment of primary periodic paralysis in order to make the drug less expensive to clients management has a tendency to operate conservatively for example from taros latest f report it can be evinced that the company does not ship products that have  months or less to expiration in order to reduce its exposure to any risk associated to a temporarily slowing demand for its medicines such peculiarity was not found on taros most direct competitors financial reports competition taros most direct competitors are teva pharmaceutical akorn merck perrigo nasdaqprgo  k form not yet provided and sandoz novartiss generic subsidiary all of the aforementioned companies have a substantially higher cost structure more debt and lower margins compared to taro however they are all trading at higher multiples valuation taro is an efficient performing business that is however barely covered by wall street analysts and thinly traded free cash flow per share is around  a value that is  to  times higher than closest competitors moreover evebit is  compared to the peers mean of  this indicates that the company is being valued relatively cheaply for each  of ebit ebitev is  compared to peers mean of  by running a fairly conservative dcf valuation it can be evinced that taros current intrinsic value is around share investment thesis taro has recently experienced an increase in pricing pressure the market is expecting a decrease in sales and the challenging pricing environment for taro to continue for the foreseeable future hence its low valuation of  pe however my view on the companys future is different my investment thesis core tenants are as follows taro has committed an increasing amount of capital on developing new medicines and accelerated its anda abbreviated new drug application filings currently  of taros andas are being reviewed by the fda one of which was tentatively approved taro recently filed  andas with the fda of which four were first to file to the extent that taro is the first to market the generic version of a significant product and particularly if the company obtains the day period of market exclusivity for the us market provided under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act sales and profitability can experience a sharp increase moreover there are multiple products for which either developmental or internal regulatory work is in process in august  novabiotics entered into an exclusive global licensing agreement with taro for the clinical development manufacturing and marketing worldwide of novexatin a product aimed at the treatment of fungal infections of the toenail onychomycosis novexatin will be the first fungal nail infection therapy to address both the underlying cause of the condition and the cosmetic issues associated with the infection based on recent studies novexatin will deliver high cure rates and rapid cosmetic benefits with only  days of treatment against  days for the existing topical treatments my view is that the market is not correctly discounting the possibility that novexatin will successfully launch in  in fact from taros latest f report it can be evinced that the company has recently received patents and obtained an exclusive license in the united states and other countries for a variety of products processes and methods of treatment including a novel antifungal compound for onychomycosis that statement which was not reported on the  and  f files gives a major hint about the several steps forward that have been done regarding novexatin the market for such infection is about  billion a year affecting  of the global population capturing around  of such market will lead to an increase in revenue of about  billion per year such scenario is relatively conservative considering the quickness and effectiveness of the treatment taros competitive advantage lies in its proven compliance in manufacturing very high quality products taro has an ability to sell at lower prices than competitors given its cost structure in addition to the pharmaceutical patents that have expired there is a significant amount of patents related to dermatology that will expire in the following years allowing taro to capture additional market share taro has been able to sustain higher margins than almost the entirety of its competitors for an extended period of time this means that the company is able to keep a competitive advantage in different market conditions nearterm pricing pressure is being offset by increasing volume and by the launch of new products significant return on assets of  suggests that its operating results are sustainable taro currently has zero debt but a substantial net cash position of around  billion taros internal vertical integration process gives it a meaningful competitive

dilip shanghvi thank you bill welcome all of you and thank you for joining us today for taro’s earnings call after the announcement of the fourth quarter and full year fiscal   financial results as we have stated for quite some time we were cautious about the longterm sustainability of some of the product prices that we were experiencing in the us we continued to see a difficult generic pricing environment particularly in the us given by more intense competition among manufacturers new entrants to the market buying consortium pressures and higher anda approval rate from the fda this product specific pricing pressure is expected to continue in future as well despite these challenges taro continues to invest in rd to develop a differentiated product pipeline which will help us in getting new business in future taro continues to be a preferred supplier with high standards of customer service it also enjoys healthy market share for many of the products in the us approximately  of taro’s product lines rank number one and number two within the product segment itself i believe that taro will maintain its leadership position delivering high quality products and creating longterm shareholder value i will now hand over the call to abhay abhay gandhi thank you mr shanghvi welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today q has been a difficult quarter for taro as indicated in the past we have faced pricing pressure in some of our products which has impacted the performance while we are faced with a challenging market environment we did a number of significant accomplishments during the year our facilities are fully compliant with regulatory agencies during the year we had two successful fda inspections health canada and a health inspection which have gone very well  key customer orders that were all successful our new jersey the distribution facility was vwag certified we continue to focus on rd we had the leading number of generic topical fda approvals in  among our competitors our customer service is our spending with  service levels taro received the supply chain excellence award from cardinal health and the rbc  manufacturer of the year award we repurchased a total of  million shares during the year returning significant value to shareholders with a large portion of our current authorization remaining finally we are encouraged by the  volume increase in the quarter our third consecutive quarter of increase as compared to the prior year quarters and by the overall  volume increase this year with cash of approximately  billion we will continue to evaluate business development opportunities with appropriate targets however we will remain disciplined in our approach for deploying this cash ensuring that our financial and operational targets are met in summary i believe we are well positioned in our target markets our strategy is solid with the leadership position in many of our key molecules the continuing focus on rd investment a healthy pipeline effective new product launches a strong balance sheet and excellent manufacturing and customer service capabilities i will now handover the call to mariano mariano balaguer thank you abhay hello everyone and welcome let me discuss some of the key financial highlights the comparisons that i will discuss are with comparable prior year periods first the q highlights followed by the full year comparison q net sales were at  million a decrease of  million or  the result of continue increased competition and challenging pricing environment overall volumes increased  driven principally by the us generic business gross profit of  million decreased  million and as a percentage of net sales was  compared to  rd expenses of  million remained in line with the comparable quarter selling marketing general and administrative expenses of  million decreases slightly as we continue to actively manage and remained disciplined with our spending and seek efficiencies wherever is possible operating income of  million decreased  million and as a percentage of net sales was  as compared to  in the prior year quarter as the result of the above q ebitda decreased  to  million ebitda margins were  compared to  for q last year foreign exchange expense decreased  million to  million principally the result of the weakening of the us dollar versus canadian dollar at a lower rate than prior period and increased us dollar cash and intercompany balances the fx is mainly balance sheet driven by us dollar denominated bank accounts and intercompany accounts receivable balances on our canadian subsidiary books tax expense decreased  million to  million resulting in an effective tax rate of  compared to  net income attributable to taro was  million as compared to a  million as the decrease in operating income was offset by the decrease in fx expenses and tax expenses and slightly increased in interest income resulting in diluted earnings per share of  compared to  for the same period last year let me now briefly discuss the full year performance and comparison to last year net sales of  million decreased  million or  while overall volumes increased  on this trend of our generic basis cost of goods increased  million the result of high volume and product mix gross profit of  million decreased  million as a percentage of net sales was  compared to  while the margin obviously they are still very strong and amounted best in the industry rd expenses of  million decrease slightly sga expenses decreased  million to  million principally as a result of a reduced keveyis spend as well as remain disciplined with our overall expenses operating income of  million decreased a  million or  versus last year ebitda of  million with a decreasing margin from  to  again is helping margin to highlight fx income increased  million to  million principally driven by the strengthening of us dollar versus canadian dollar at a slightly lower rate as compared to the prior year fx again is mainly balance sheet driven other gain of  million increased  million primarily driven by the sale of keveyis in the fiscal third quarter of fiscal  tax expenses increased  million principally the result of certain tax benefit in the prior year not realized in the current year resulting in an effective tax rate increase to  from  net income attributable to taro was  million compared to  million and  million decrease as the decrease in operating income was partially offset by the increase of fx and the interest income resulting in diluted earnings per share of  million compared to  our cash flow and balance sheet remain extremely strong cash provided by operation for the year ended march   of  million as compared to  million for the year ended march   cash including shortterm bank deposit and marketable securities of  billion increased a  million from march  despite of a  million impact on the company share repurchase in fiscal  recently we entered in two agreements one of them on april  of  we entered into a development and commercialization license agreement with crescita therapeutics under which crescita has granted taro an exclusive license to the right to serve and distribute pliaglis in the us for a secondgeneration enhanced version with patent pending while these are relatively small transactions that demonstrate our willingness to pursue opportunities which might farther with our portfolio we return value to our shareholders through our share repurchase program in august we successfully complete our  million share repurchase program repurchasing  million shares in open market transactions of which  million were purchased subsequent to april   during the fourth quarter the company repurchased  shares at an average price of  in total during the fiscal year ending march   the company repurchased  million shares at an average price of a  we still have unutilized buyback authorization of  million i will now turn the floor back to abhay gandhi abhay gandhi thanks mariano before we open the floor to your questions i want to briefly address the doj investigation while we have nothing new to report on this we take this matter very seriously and we continue to work with our counsel to cooperate doj we also remain committed to strong corporate governance and fostering a compliance culture at taro finally i would like to thank the entire taro team and all of our employees for their continuing outstanding efforts throughout the year during these very challenging times i’m confident that taro is well positioned for the future and that we will continue to meet these challenges to move the company forward with this i would like to open the floor up for your questions thank you questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions the first question from the line is gregg gilbert from deutsche bank sir your line is now open gregg gilbert yes thank you good day i was hoping you could speak to your expectations for revenues and margins for the coming year and if you can’t be specific could you at least talk qualitatively or directionally around the challenges you’re facing now and whether you expect them to sort of abate and stabilize in the next year or so thanks a lot abhay gandhi thanks gregg for your question i think directionally i think the challenges that we have seen in the last quarter were continued in the new financial year going ahead also i think what we talked about in the readout and what we all know in the consolidation of the buyer groups which has now down to three buyers with indiscernible also joining the wbad group and then the higher number of approval that we are seeing from the fda i think the pressure on the business is going to continue and i think the challenge for us is to find ways and means to hold onto the business that we have and keep increasing the volumes and market share in products where we can get a sensible kind of price gregg gilbert let’s hope that the pressure from the consolidation of the buyers will sort of anniversary in  versus ’ and result in pricing going down next year versus this year abhay gandhi difficult to estimate we cannot predict how it will pan out but logically when you have a consolidation of buying in the hands of just three conglomerates which will account for  of the total market your guess is as good as mine operator and our next question comes from the line of prakash agarwal from axis capital your line is now open prakash agarwal just trying to understand with the approval that has come during the last quarter and approval that we’re expecting given the  plus ndas that we have so how good is this to offset the increasing pricing pressure because we saw the increased pressure in q and if we analyze in fiscal ’ that could be further markdowns so i’m just trying to understand how confident in terms of number of products or qualitatively any key approvals that we are looking at which could help arrest this fall thank you abhay gandhi the new product that we will get during the year will be available of course through the course of the year at different periods of time but as the pricing pressure that we see will be for the duration of the year so not really sure whether the products that will come in and can entirely mitigate the pricing pressure that we are talking about on the size and the scale of the business that we are seeing our objective of course will be to launch a new product and keep up with the track record that taro has that we wish to be either number one or number two with each of the product launches that will be our task going ahead and it’s a track record that we have worked hard to maintain going ahead operator thank you and our next question comes from ram selvaraju from rodman  renshaw sir your line is now open unidentified analyst hi there this is mitchell on for ram thanks for taking my questions can you outline the development timeline for shigamab and do you have the total breakdown of  sales by pliaglis abhay gandhi i couldn’t get the second part of your question so i’ll answer the first part and then maybe you could repeat the second part for my benefit so the first product i think we should we able to file during the current financial year that’s our expectation and what other question on crescita you said unidentified analyst do you have the breakdown of sales for  generated by pliaglis abhay gandhi i mean we have clearly but not something that i can share on this call operator and our next question comes from the line of anubhav aggarwal from credit suisse your line is now open anubhav aggarwal yes so one question with the new environment of more competition can you give some color of how taro’s rd program will change from now in the sense that do you want to spend more on rd from now or less in terms selection of products some colors will be useful on the rd program in the new context abhay gandhi i think in the readout and release also we have said that investment in rd will continue it is not something that we look on a quarteronquarter basis so i think on a longterm perspective i think we have good rd team in place we are excited about the projects that we are working on and the investment in rd will continue and directionally i don’t want to take a standard increase or remain same but its depends on the projects and the product that we have in the pipeline and how much each one of them will require to be invested but it’s a continuous investment for the future that we will continue to do operator and our next question comes from the line of indiscernible sbi capital your line is now open unidentified analyst just a couple of few things one would there be any impact of new shelf stock adjustment for prior quarter deliveries that came into the fourth quarter and second with the new pricing pressure and competitive pressure that you’re seeing in your core area of dermatology would your rd programs taking new direction in terms of other therapeutic areas or other product lines et cetera abhay gandhi i’ll answer the second part of your question and it’s a continuation on the earlier question which was asked of me i think and we will continue to invest on rd most of our rd is derm focus but we also have some products which are not exactly in dermatology which is especially being developed for the generic part of the business so no there is no sudden change in our rd strategy that’s the question you’re trying to ask for the first part i think mariano would you like to answer mariano balaguer it was difficult to understand you do you mind please to repeat your question abhay gandhi the first part of your question sorry could you please repeat your first part of your question dilip shanghvi okay we will take it later can we go to the next question please operator our next participant called by the name of neha manpuria from jp morgan your line is now open neha manpuria thank you for taking my question sir given we have about  billion of cash in our books we have done some smaller deals but how are we looking at inorganic growth opportunities particularly given the generic dermatology and business is becoming more tough with the competition abhay gandhi so i don’t know that i heard you correctly i heard organic opportunities neha manpuria inorganic sorry abhay gandhi inorganic opportunities neha manpuria inorganic abhay gandhi yes yes thank you clearly neha i mean we continue to look for opportunities with the same kind of discipline that we have always talked about if we can find a product or a business which we think and grow in our hands and we can make is successful and at the right kind of financial metrics and payback that we all just talk about i think we definitely keep looking out for that neha manpuria so your preference would be for a more product like approach rather than business because those are the kind of deals that you seem to be doing on more on the specialty side would that be fair to say abhay gandhi no we have no such preference i mean we’ll keep looking for opportunities and whatever helps us to grow we will be open so no preference really operator and our next question comes from the line of nimish mehta from research delta advisors your line is now open nimish mehta yes hi thanks for taking my question i just wanted to clarify i heard and wanted to make sure you said that the price erosion was more pronounced in few products at this quarter is that right and second also wanted to know was the price erosion in general more aggravated or it was more aggravated for derma as a segment than the other segments of generic industry thank you abhay gandhi i think the price erosion does not differentiate between therapies so it’s equally bad and i think all therapies that we are looking at as far as taro is concerned we are more worried about what happens in the derm space and naturally in a particular product where you have two or three or four approvals coming in in a particular quarter that those are the kinds of products where the price erosion is far more than the others so the buyer consolidation being like a constant the other factor which then impacts you is the number of approvals that come in the quarter for a given product nimish mehta so it was more because of i mean this quarter was more impacted because of few products abhay gandhi last two quarters the rate of approvals have gone up much higher than what we normally used to see so what we saw in the q the impact of that would be really felt in q because for the products to then become available get some share from customer so you see a little bit of a lag so as far as approvals are concerned we saw in the peak in q slightly less in q but overall for the last six months far higher than what we would normally see nimish mehta so it was across the board right it was not concentrated in few products is what i am trying to understand abhay gandhi no i don’t know what you mean by across the board i mean i cannot guarantee then each and every molecule that we are marketing there were large number of competitors which came in for example  new approvals came in q and approximately  new approvals came in q those are the numbers i can give you but whether it is for each and every molecule that we are marketing that’s not really true operator our next question comes from the line of elliot wilbur from raymond james sir your line is now open elliot wilbur good morning with respect to price erosion could you quantify that number for the fourth quarter i mean understand obviously reported sales growth and you gave volumes but just trying to tease out the differential between price impact on the portfolio and then what the contribution may have been from new products and i guess if its possible to discern the difference between the negative impact of new competitive of new competitive launches against your existing portfolio versus the impact of the consolidation of the buyers group maybe not a specific quantitative measure but if you could talk about qualitatively which of those you think have the greater impact over the last couple of quarters thank you abhay gandhi i actually don’t know any methodology by which i can differentiate the pricing pressure how much of that is because of buyer consolidation and how much of that is because of new approvers so overall if you want to see what kind of an impact we have then you should directly look at what is the volume increase we have see in the business and overall decline in the revenues that will give you a fair indicator of by how much the prices have come down because overall we have run a tight shift so on expenses we haven’t really increased rd we continue to invest so the difference is essentially because price erosion mariano balaguer indiscernible mix as well elliot wilbur okay but no no significant positive benefit from new products than yearoveryear abhay gandhi i’m sorry can you repeat that please elliot wilbur so there wasnt really a significant positive impact from new launches yearoveryear in terms of the reported revenue number abhay gandhi we did around one significant product during the year but just remember on the scale that we are talking about one new product in the very first year doesn’t really help us to move the needle operator and our next question comes from the line of girish bakhru from hsbc your line is now open girish bakhru hi just again on the approval side abhay any i mean concern on some delayed approvals on certain products given that we have seen some of the markets have gone generic with taro not getting approval in those products despite all facilities being clear abhay gandhi actually no girish if i see our own rd productivity i think during the course of the year we have been the number one company in terms of the number of approvals that we have received so i think overall i think we are happy with the rd productivity the quality of our filing and therefore i think the approvals that we get from the fda i think the task for all of us is to being able to do that sustainably yearonyear girish bakhru actually related question on that is in the pipeline of  andas i mean how do you basically judge then going forward is these pipeline of products are more technical even though they maybe derm products or they something of the sort where you would see the number of approvals on one day would not be more than one or two is there a possible color that you can give on that abhay gandhi no i mean we have our best guess but that’s about it we would not know for a given molecule how many would have filed and we can only guess operator our next question comes from the line of sameer baisiwala from morgan stanley your line is now open sameer baisiwala hi thank you so much just a quick one if i look at your financials were in last six quarters they have been coming off say on the top line and on the operating profit line but last quarter was quite peculiar like early it was some gradual  million  million sort of time down but last quarter it came down  million plus on top line and also on operating profit so the question here is was anything oneoff in the quarter and second are should we start working from this new base of roughly  million on top line and  million dollar on the operating profit for the current business assuming no new approvals abhay gandhi sameer there is no oneoff so this is a market reality and the challenge which all of us in the space are going to face and we do our best to try and mitigate these circumstances so there is no oneoff sameer baisiwala okay and just a related question i can send competitive intensity but just on the buyer consolidation and the three consortiums which are there is it something to say that you know this is at some point i am behind us or is this a recurring theme that every year there is shop up on your door and then give you a  million tap what is the right way to think about this pressure abhay gandhi i don’t know i’m trying to understand your question little more clearly i know it used to be five then four then three now whether that three will become a two i could not know you and i should pray together on this one sameer baisiwala no abhay what i mean to say is assuming it remains three is it something to say that they work towards a certain goal and the method in terms of their cost savings or is this a recurring theme with just three around that they will come and ask for their pound of flesh every year hope for a foreseeable future so its a recurring pressure abhay gandhi it will be sameer a recurring pressure i think rather than look at it as how do they want to run the business or we want to run the business i think the logic is simple if you have your sales spread across just three buyers and even if you loss one for a particular product then the loss is very significant for any company so you would try and do your best to protect your existing business and that is where i think any tradeoff between keeping a share of the market or losing a little bit of value on price so it’s more to do with handling of the large buyer groups as an organization in a competitive environment so it’s not that they come with the prefix step every year you have to give me this kind of a reduction its more to do with what kind of tradeoffs happen in the process of trying to keep your shade operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of kartik mehta from deutsche bank your line is now open kartik mehta yes hi i just trying to understand this so abhay is it fair to assume that  volume which we deal now its more out of an option which we have to i mean just to ensure that we also participate to maintain and increase our market share in an event where three overall buyers are consolidating im just trying to understand here that from where did the volume gain happened in this quarter thank you abhay gandhi i think irrespective of the buyer consolidation or otherwise i think any good business would like to focus on volume gain as a strategy so that you have more people using your product you have more customers who are using your products and buying your products so i think it’s a strategic objective of any organization to try and increase volumes wherever they can i am not saying every time the company would be successful but clearly if you ask me that would be an objective right kartik mehta yes because we have seen in q this is driven by  now  and previously the commentary and the results have been either the volumes have seen very marginal increase or they have decreased so im just understanding is this a new way in which taro is approaching existing competition indiscernible abhay gandhi it’s not a new way it’s not a new way what i’m trying to say is that it’s been always an objective maybe we are seeing the result of it operator our next question comes from the line of rahul deshmukh from private investor your line is now open unidentified analyst hello hi this is rahul deshmukh again thank you for taking my call my question for is more some of ownership structure and this is to do with the sun taro relationship right now i believe that sun owns about  of voting rights of taro so my question is how does taro management look at this ownership and what are their thoughts once sun reaches  of the ownership sun has the right to own taro completely so how is does taro management looking at this abhay gandhi the taro is an independent company and all decisions that we take are with the best interest of the taro as a company and our employees work for the business so that has been our overarching principle of operations anyway so i don’t think there is any kind of pressure or directive from the sun ownership to try and influence the way taro functions so that’s very clear and i don’t think theres any ambiguity on it unidentified analyst okay appreciate your response abhay gandhi i think we differentiate ownership from management of the company and i think we manage the business and taro in the best interest of the company unidentified analyst okay appreciate that and my second question was regarding the phase ii product that the clinical trials were completed about  months ago on novexatin for the onychomycosis treatment of the fungal toe infection and we havent seen any update whatsoever from taro and yet and we are monitoring the clinical trial sides and stuff but we dont see anything all we know is the trials are completed the phase iib and no updates have been provided by taro as yet and its a big market opportunity abhay gandhi rahul i can give you brief right now so when you see that the study we did the singles are positive but we are going to do a larger scale of phase b study and that study is completed only then we can say that any degree of confidence of the products will meet the expected efficacy and safety parameter the initial results of course are encouraging and we hope for the best the previous examples practically like phase iia so it helped to design certain parameters in phase iib which is the current one and right now we are in the middle of  sorry you wanted to ask the question when i am answering unidentified analyst no sorry sorry go ahead please abhay gandhi okay so we are in the middle of recruitment of the patients and due to the fda requirement and the clinical nature of onychomycosis we do not think study will end before the  calendar year operator and our next question comes from the line of chirag dagli from hdfc mutual fund your line is now open chirag dagli yes thank you for the opportunity so there is volume growth of  for the full fiscal is this from new product launches or is this existing product that youre gaining some share abhay gandhi mix of both actually chirag dagli okay meaningfully tilted towards i mean i know the number is too small but this one product that you launched has that materially contributed to this volume growth or is it that the existing basis abhay gandhi logically as i said one product will not on total volumes mean an increase of  that’s why i said it’s a mix of both chirag dagli okay fair point and sir what would be your tax rate guidance abhay gandhi no we don’t give any tax rate guidance chirag dagli but this i mean is there some is there an element of you know unsustainable tax benefit in this mariano balaguer i think when you see our announcement in the press release you can see  were some oneoff benefit there we do not provide any tax item but we also believe our sustainability of our current situation operator and our next question comes from the line of sameer baisiwala from morgan stanley your line is now open sameer baisiwala yes thanks for the followon quick question abhay is there any thoughts on geographic diversification taking your high class for a portfolio outside of united states and what you’re doing in canada and israel abhay gandhi constantly evaluating in a couple of products we are filing in the eu during the course of this year sameer baisiwala okay but looks like a little incremental i mean is there a plan to take whatever   products to latin america europe or any other geography abhay gandhi from what i see right now it will not be a big bank sameer baisiwala okay and second question very quickly on that list looks like the patent is going to expire in  i think it was approved in  if i’m not wrong so the key attraction is the newer version of the product i mean is that the key motivation behind this deal abhay gandhi i think it’s a good product and it fits into our basket and also allows us to get into a little bit of a specialty space and that’s what the major attraction is often i don’t recall which year the patent expires you may be right its  but i think it’s a product where we don’t expect at least at this point in time too much of competition so we feel we can do well fits into our portfolio and gives us the specialty look sameer baisiwala okay so and you’re referring to the end market product abhay gandhi yes operator and our next question comes from the line of rahul deshmukh private investor your line is now open unidentified analyst thank you again much appreciated so my second question was regarding this  billion of cash that taro is sitting and obviously over the years you have been very frugal and prudent with your investment approach focusing more on rd my question though is now looking at the us market yes definitely the pharma market was highly inflated at some point but right now with big the companies pretty much generic big companies and big trouble it must have become very lucrative so my question for you is at this point what is your thought process in defining what does it mean that whatever acquisitions you may explore are lucrative because you have been saying that many times that we are monitoring and stuff but what time that monitoring becomes action abhay gandhi i really couldn’t understand your question rahul unidentified analyst sorry my question was you have  billion in cash and now a lot of assets out there in the pharma sector have become lucrative from an acquisition perspective just because of the fact that their prices have dropped dramatically so when now are you going abhay gandhi as i said rahul we don’t look at what is an asset cost today and is it lucrative in as you saybut it also has to fit into what we are good at doing is there a way for us to grow that business is that a way to make it profitable if it is not so all those things come into consideration we would not just go and buy something just because it is available at cheap or at the right kind of valuation it also has to do with how does it add value to taro unidentified analyst so then maybe what i can ask you is what kind of areas would add value to current taro business line what was therapeutic area abhay gandhi i think on the other cause itself this question has been answered we really aren’t a global company so the business that we are looking at has to be us focus it can be in term it can be in areas which are specialty and yes these are the two basic criteria that we will look at or it has product portfolio which has to be complementary to what we have and we think we can do good with that operator and our next question comes from the line of ram selvaraju from rodman  renshaw your line is now open unidentified analyst hi there it’s mitchell on again i was just wondering if you guys are open the business development opportunities and the orphan disease and medical esthetics domains if you guys are actively looking or plan to look abhay gandhi open to both those options if there is something happy to look at operator and thank you ladies and gentlemen that was our last question i will now hand the floor back to mr coote for closing remarks william coote thank you thank you everyone for joining us today and taking the time to be on our earnings call we look forward to speaking to you again after our  the release of our second quarter earnings and this concludes our conference again thank you and have

pharmaceutical industries ltd  last revised  august  fluorouracil fluorouracil creamtaro pharmaceutical industries ltd for topical use onlynot for ophthalmic oral or intravaginal use descriptionfluorouracil topical cream is a topical preparation containing the fluorinated pyrimidine fluorouracil an antineoplastic antimetabolite fluorouracil topical cream contains  ww of fluorouracil usp in a cream base consisting of methylparaben polysorbate  propylene glycol propylparaben purified water stearyl alcohol and white petrolatum chemically fluorouracil is fluoroh hpyrimidinedione it is a white to practically white crystalline powder which is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol one gram of fluorouracil is soluble in  ml of propylene glycol the molecular weight of fluorouracil is  and the structural formula is chemical structure clinical pharmacology there is evidence that the metabolism of fluorouracil in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid in this manner fluorouracil interferes with the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid dna and to a lesser extent inhibits the formation of ribonucleic acid rna since dna and rna are essential for cell division and growth the effect of fluorouracil may be to create a thymine deficiency which provokes unbalanced growth and death of the cell the effects of dna and rna deprivation are most marked on those cells which grow more rapidly and take up fluorouracil at a more rapid rate the catabolic metabolism of fluorouracil results in degradation products eg co  urea αfluoroβalanine which are inactive systemic absorption studies of topically applied fluorouracil have been performed on patients with actinic keratoses using tracer amounts of  clabeled fluorouracil added to a  preparation all patients had been receiving nonlabeled fluorouracil until the peak of the inflammatory reaction occurred  to  weeks ensuring that the time of maximum absorption was used for measurement one gram of labeled preparation was applied to the entire face and neck and left in place for  hours urine samples were collected at the end of  days the total recovery ranged between  and  with an average of  indicating that approximately  of the topical dose was absorbed systemically if applied twice daily this would indicate systemic absorption of topical fluorouracil to be in the range of  to  mg per daily dose of  mg in an additional study negligible amounts of labeled material were found in plasma urine and expired co after  days of treatment with topically applied  clabeled fluorouracil fluorouracil indications and usagefluorouracil is recommended for the topical treatment of multiple actinic or solar keratoses in the  strength it is also useful in the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinomas when conventional methods are impractical such as with multiple lesions or difficult treatment sites safety and efficacy in other indications have not been established the diagnosis should be established prior to treatment since this method has not been proven effective in other types of basal cell carcinomas with isolated easily accessible basal cell carcinomas surgery is preferred since success with such lesions is almost  the success rate with fluorouracil cream and solution is approximately  based on  lesions in  patients twentyfive lesions treated with the solution produced  failure and  lesions treated with the cream produced  failures contraindicationsfluorouracil may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman there are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women with either the topical or the parenteral forms of fluorouracil one birth defect cleft lip and palate has been reported in the newborn of a patient using fluorouracil as recommended one birth defect ventricular septal defect and cases of miscarriage have been reported when fluorouracil was applied to mucous membrane areas multiple birth defects have been reported in a fetus of a patient treated with intravenous fluorouracil animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with fluorouracil fluorouracil administered parenterally has been shown to be teratogenic in mice rats and hamsters when given at doses equivalent to the usual human intravenous dose however the amount of fluorouracil absorbed systemically after topical administration to actinic keratoses is minimal see clinical pharmacology fluorouracil exhibited maximum teratogenicity when given to mice as single intraperitoneal injections of  to  mgkg on day  or  of gestation similarly intraperitoneal doses of  to  mgkg given to rats between days  and  of gestation and intramuscular doses of  to  mgkg given to hamsters between days  and  of gestation were teratogenic andor embryotoxic ie resulted in increased resorptions or embryolethality in monkeys divided doses of  mgkg given between days  and  of gestation were not teratogenic doses higher than  mgkg resulted in abortion fluorouracil should not be used in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase dpd enzyme deficiency a large percentage of fluorouracil is catabolized by the dpd enzyme dpd enzyme deficiency can result in shunting of fluorouracil to the anabolic pathway leading to cytotoxic activity and potential toxicities fluorouracil is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant during therapy if this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while using this drug the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus fluorouracil is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its components warnings application to mucous membranes should be avoided due to the possibility of local inflammation and ulceration additionally cases of miscarriage and a birth defect ventricular septal defect have been reported when fluorouracil was applied to mucous membrane areas during pregnancy occlusion of the skin with resultant hydration has been shown to increase percutaneous penetration of several topical preparations if any occlusive dressing is used in treatment of basal cell carcinoma there may be an increase in the severity of inflammatory reactions in the adjacent normal skin a porous gauze dressing may be applied for cosmetic reasons without increase in reaction exposure to ultraviolet rays should be minimized during and immediately following treatment with fluorouracil because the intensity of the reaction may be increased patients should discontinue therapy with fluorouracil if symptoms of dpd enzyme deficiency develop see contraindications section rarely lifethreatening toxicities such as stomatitis diarrhea neutropenia and neurotoxicity have been reported with intravenous administration of fluorouracil in patients with dpd enzyme deficiency one case of life threatening systemic toxicity has been reported with the topical use of fluorouracil in a patient with dpd enzyme deficiency symptoms included severe abdominal pain bloody diarrhea vomiting fever and chills physical examination revealed stomatitis erythematous skin rash neutropenia thrombocytopenia inflammation of the esophagus stomach and small bowel although this case was observed with  fluorouracil cream it is unknown whether patients with profound dpd enzyme deficiency would develop systemic toxicity with lower concentrations of topically applied fluorouracil precautions general there is a possibility of increased absorption through ulcerated or inflamed skin information for patients patients should be forewarned that the reaction in the treated areas may be unsightly during therapy and usually for several weeks following cessation of therapy patients should be instructed to avoid exposure to ultraviolet rays during and immediately following treatment with fluorouracil because the intensity of the reaction may be increased if fluorouracil is applied with the fingers the hands should be washed immediately afterward fluorouracil should not be applied on the eyelids or directly into the eyes nose or mouth because irritation may occur laboratory tests solar keratoses which do not respond should be biopsied to confirm the diagnosis followup biopsies should be performed as indicated in the management of superficial basal cell carcinoma carcinogenesis mutagenesis impairment of fertility adequate longterm studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with fluorouracil studies with the active ingredient of fluorouracil fluorouracil have shown positive effects in in vitro tests for mutagenicity and on impairment of fertility fluorouracil was positive in three in vitro cell neoplastic transformation assays in the cht clone  mouse embryo cell system the resulting morphologically transformed cells formed tumors when inoculated into immunosuppressed syngeneic mice while no evidence for mutagenic activity was observed in the ames test  studies fluorouracil has been shown to be mutagenic in the survival count recassay with bacillus subtilis and in the drosophila winghair spot test fluorouracil produced petite mutations in saccharomyces cerevisiae and was positive in the micronucleus test bone marrow cells of male mice fluorouracil was clastogenic in vitro ie chromatid gaps breaks and exchanges in chinese hamster fibroblasts at concentrations of  and  µgml and has been shown to increase sister chromatid exchange in vitro in human lymphocytes in addition fluorouracil has been reported to produce an increase in numerical and structural chromosome aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes of patients treated with this product doses of  to  mgkg administered intraperitoneally have been shown to induce chromosomal aberrations and changes in chromosome organization of spermatogonia in rats spermatogonial differentiation was also inhibited by fluorouracil resulting in transient infertility however in studies with a strain of mouse which is sensitive to the induction of sperm head abnormalities after exposure to a range of chemical mutagens and carcinogens fluorouracil was inactive at oral doses of  to  mgkgday in female rats fluorouracil administered intraperitoneally at doses of  and  mgkg during the preovulatory phase of oogenesis significantly reduced the incidence of fertile matings delayed the development of preimplantation and postimplantation embryos increased the incidence of preimplantation lethality and induced chromosomal anomalies in these embryos single dose intravenous and intraperitoneal injections of fluorouracil have been reported to kill differentiated spermatogonia and spermatocytes at  mgkg and to produce abnormalities in spermatids at  mgkg in mice pregnancy teratogenic effects pregnancy category x see contraindications section nursing mothers it is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk because there is some systemic absorption of fluorouracil after topical administration see clinical pharmacology because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue use of the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother pediatric use safety and effectiveness in children have not been established adverse reactions to fluorouracilthe most frequent adverse reactions to fluorouracil occur locally and are often related to an extension of the pharmacological activity of the drug these include burning crusting allergic contact dermatitis erosions erythema hyperpigmentation irritation pain photosensitivity pruritus scarring rash soreness and ulceration ulcerations other local reactions cases of miscarriage and a birth defect ventricular septal defect have been reported when fluorouracil was applied to mucous membrane areas leukocytosis is the most frequent hematological side effect although a causal relationship is remote other adverse reactions which have been reported infrequently are central nervous system emotional upset insomnia irritability gastrointestinal medicinal taste stomatitis hematological eosinophilia thrombocytopenia toxic granulation integumentary alopecia blistering bullous pemphigoid discomfort ichthyosis scaling suppuration swelling telangiectasia tenderness urticaria skin rash special senses conjunctival reaction corneal reaction lacrimation nasal irritation miscellaneous herpes simplex overdosagethere have been no reports of overdosage with fluorouracil the oral ld for the  topical cream was  mgkg in rats and  mgkg in dogs these doses represented  and  mgkg of fluorouracil respectively studies with a  topical solution yielded an oral ld of  mgkg in rats and  mgkg in dogs corresponding to  and  mgkg of fluorouracil respectively the topical application of the  cream to rats yielded an ld of greater than  mgkg dosage and administrationwhen fluorouracil is applied to a lesion a response occurs with the following sequence erythema usually followed by vesiculation desquamation erosion and reepithelialization fluorouracil should be applied preferably with a nonmetal applicator or suitable glove if fluorouracil is applied with the fingers the hands should be washed immediately afterward actinic or solar keratosis apply cream twice daily in an amount sufficient to cover the lesions medication should be continued until the inflammatory response reaches the erosion stage at which time use of the drug should be terminated the usual duration of therapy is from  to  weeks complete healing of the lesions may not be evident for  to  months following cessation of fluorouracil therapy superficial basal cell carcinomas only the  strength is recommended apply cream twice daily in an amount sufficient to cover the lesions treatment should be continued for at least  to  weeks therapy may be required for as long as  to  weeks before the lesions are obliterated as in any neoplastic condition the patient should be followed for a
