purchasestarting with the great stuff this powerpointbook conveys information visually long term trends jump at you immediately i hope this is an emerging trend among nonfiction authorsmore specifically this book conveys excellent information regarding the rising costs of social entitlements medicare medicaid social security and health care costs medicare and medicaid are the main causes why usa inc incurs rising yearly budget deficits and has a negative net worth of  trillions social entitlements will consume  of the federal budget by  slide   of the federal budget by  slide  and  by  when adding net interest expenses slide  the related health care costs are rising due to an aging population expensive technology and rising utilizationthe choice of corrective actions increase in taxes and reduction in benefits to render social security sustainable are modest slide  but the ones to shore up medicare are draconian slide  end of life care is exorbitant as last year of life accounts for  of all medicare spending slide  returning medicare and medicaid to long term solvency will prove challenging reducing reimbursement rates to health care providers is tough since hospitals already incur net losses of   of revenues for medicare patients and   for medicaid ones slide  hospitals make up those losses by cost shifting to privately insured patients where they make up staggering profit margins of   this is one of the main causes of the health care crisis associated with skyrocketing insurance premium employers dropping insurance coverage benefits and a rising uninsured populationthe international health care cost comparison slide  and  demonstrates how our prehealth care reform system was egregiously more expensive and less effective than any other major oecd country we pay a lot more and get less health than anyone else there is no doubt the system should be reformed we also bear responsibility for our health care costs as our rate of obesity has skyrocketed since  see map of the us slide  costs related to obesity amount to  of overall healthcare coststhe study of the drivers of the fiscal budget    and     gdp growth on the tax receipt side and government policy and demographic changes on the spending side is insightful also the benchmarking of growth rates in various tax receipts and government spending is interesting you can see how entitlement expenses growing at  pa over the past  years at twice the gdp rate have swamped everything else our increase in consumer spending from  of gdp to  of gdp since  was driven by health care spending slide  health care and housing spending have nearly doubled as a  of gdp since  slide  and rising unfunded entitlements are often a long term driver of debt crisis for many countries slide  see the fate of the pigs countries on this count slide  all those trends calls for a restructuring of our social entitlement programswithin the section on defense spending    meeker reveals that defense spending is clearly not a fiscal issue as a  of gdp such costs are historically moderate at only  of gdpthe visual explanation of the housing bubble    is excellent you can see the negative correlation between the us personal savings rate and the us homeownership rate something was clearly wrong the related section of freddie mac and fannie mae  and the potential ultimate cost to taxpayers is also excellentwe also have an education crisis even though education spending has risen from  to  of gdp since  our performance ranking among oecd countries has plummetedfor the not so good stuff there are a few arithmetic mistakes slide  describes who pays for health care  government  private insurers  individuals that adds up to  it should add to a  slide  should be taken out it attempts to teach one the difference between a trillion and a billion it suggests a trillion is  times a billion instead it is  on slide  hours work per week cant possibly have decreased by  per year since  yet have remained constant at  to  hoursadditionally comparing government spending to a companys finance as meeker does has limitations in her language any net loss and any debt is bad but in government finance those concepts are not so meaningful instead the key benchmark is whether the debtgdp ratio is sustainable lets say a country wants to maintain a moderate debtgdp ratio of  and has a long term real gdp growth of  and an inflation rate of  this implies a sustainable budget deficit of      of gdp in other words such a country could run budget deficits at  of gdp forever and its debtgdp ratio would remain stable at  this sustainable leverage framework is absent from the book instead meeker asks slide  how can we shore up this business so it can break even or generate a profit within this decade on the next slide she suggests that running net losses budget deficits always boost the debtgdp ratio as clarified those statements are either incorrect or raise the wrong issueanother weakness of the book is to make very long dated historical comparisons that are irrelevant a graph on page xi shows that from  to  federal government spending averaged only  of gdp but any fiscal history prior to the early s when medicare and medicaid were fully operational is not relevant it conveys a misleading message that in former centuries our federal government was run more efficiently at only  of gdp vs  now but there is a huge difference between having no government  of gdp is pretty much that and an efficient government probably around  of gdpall in all this still makes for a great reference if you are interested in the subject i also strongly recommend the the coming generational storm what you need to know about americas economic futureread more comments

wikipedia mary n meeker from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search mary nacol meeker edd – was an american educational psychologist and entrepreneur she is best known for her applying j p guilfords structure of intellect theory of human intelligence to the field of education meeker was born in louisiana and grew up there and in texas she attended the university of texas at austin and graduated with a bachelor of science degree in psychology meeker subsequently moved to california and began graduate studies in educational psychology at the university of southern california where she studied with j p guilford whose work would be central to her career meeker earned a master of science a master of education and in  a phd in education from usc contents  si and soi  soi testing  soi training  later work  articles and books  selected articles  honors and positions  references si and soiedit meekers doctoral dissertation focused on applying guilfords structure of intellect theory si to creating assessments and curriculum materials for use in teaching children and adults the premise of si is that intelligence comprises many underlying mental abilities or factors organized along three dimensions—operations eg comprehension content eg semantic and products eg relations in this threedimensional model each intersection of the three dimensions represents as a unique intellectual ability such as comprehension of semantic relations that is understanding analogies during meekers studies she saw the potential of applying si in the field of education based on a twofold premise  intelligence can be precisely measured using a test that identifies an individuals aptitude on the multiple intellectual abilities identified in the structure of intellect model and  the individuals intellectual abilities can be remediated or improved using learning materials that target each particular ability meeker called her application of guilfords theory soi soi testingedit soi assessment materials including the soi learning abilities or soila test instrument measure intelligence corresponding to those intellectual abilities from guilfords si model that meeker determined to be most closely correlated to educational and professional success she excluded other si abilities from soi due to their perceived difficulty of assessment or their lack of correlation to educational requirements after she normed and validated the soila instrument in the late s and early s she began producing tests and corresponding remedial materials for school districts and private clinics in many states the soila is accepted for screening students for admission into gifted and special education school programs and worldwide soila is used in private clinics soi trainingedit soi learning materials are useful in addressing learning disabilities in early childhood education basic school tasks such as reading or arithmetic are actually complex tasks that require application of multiple underlying abilities because children who fail at these classroom tasks often lack the underlying abilities to succeed at them attempts to teach those children to perform such tasks are not successful some children who cannot read may lack the underlying intellectual ability to associate a word ie a series of graphical figures with its meaning ie a semantic unit and some children who cannot perform arithmetic may lack the underlying intellectual ability to associate a digit a numeric unit with its meaning a symbolic unit soi training can remediate these underlying intellectual abilities to enable mastery of reading and arithmetic the soi model is designed to address learning disabilities in stages an soi test assesses the individuals underlying intellectual abilities including the constituent abilities enabling performance of the targeted task then after the individuals soi profile is compared against the intellectual abilities that enable the targeted task such as reading or arithmetic specific intellectual abilities are identified for remediation finally soi curriculum materials train the identified abilities so that after the abilities are remediated the individual may learn to perform the more complex task the soi model can be useful in assessing learning styles because the soila test includes separate measures of visual and auditory learning abilities soi has been related to the multiple intelligences theory promulgated by howard gardner later workedit in  meeker and her husband robert meeker opened the soi institute a business producing soi tests and educational materials and conducting training for educators and related research during the s and s meeker developed a wide reputation in the field of educational psychology and continued to run the soi institute during this time meeker was engaged as a consultant for the state departments of education in california idaho louisiana mississippi nevada new mexico ohio oklahoma oregon south carolina texas virginia washington and wisconsin in the s meeker worked extensively with bridges learning systems a commercial enterprise founded by former us senator william e brock to implement school programs based on meekers soi work and on the integrated practice protocol ipp she developed with her husband robert meeker ipp comprises soirelated assessments and learning and teaching materials that incorporate intelligence assessment such as with the soila test vision assessment and sensory integration assessment for example some children who cannot read may lack the underlying ability to visually distinguish one alphabetical character from another this perceptual visual aspect of soi illustrates the extensions of soi application made in ipp by meeker and meeker in later life mary meeker devoted herself semiprofessionally to watercolor painting winning a variety of local prizes her subjects of choice were florals and landscapes mary meeker died in
