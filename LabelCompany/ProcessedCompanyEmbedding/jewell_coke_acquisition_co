cokemaking process started when b ray thompson built three test ovens in vansant virginia in the early ’s a four month test found that coke could be made from virginia coal production was scaled up during the next ten years in   tons of coke were produced per year at what is now our jewell cokemaking facility production continued to expand into the ’s when  large jewellthompson ovens were built increasing capacity by  tons per year in the early ’s suncoke energy improved its technology with enhanced combustion control and oven construction techniques thereby enhancing coke quality then in the late ’s we developed new technologies and processes to monitor and control oven temperatures increasing our coking cycles to  hours with a mature and robust coke oven technology suncoke energy continued to improve its coke quality and coaltocoke yield through the s during that time we also implemented our heat recoverypower generation technology as a result of the design improvements and

gerald warren william b cudlip douglas d roche dickinson wright mckean  cudlip stephen e dawson detroit mich for plaintiffappellee before edwards and celebrezze circuit judges and zirpoli senior district judge edwards circuit judge  plaintiff mclouth steel corporation the tenth largest steel producer in the nation filed this complaint under the diversity jurisdiction of the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan southern division against jewell coal and coke company a virginia corporation with principal offices in knoxville tennessee and its affiliated coal companies seeking enforcement by injunctive relief of a contract for sale and purchase of coke used in mclouths furnaces the contract was executed in  with an initial term of  years and an option on mclouths part to extend same for an additional  years  the district judge who heard this day trial found all issues in favor of mclouth he held the contract to be an unambiguous requirements contract and that jewell was obligated to supply all coke over  tons a month supplied under another contract which mclouth required and ordered he issued a mandatory injunction requiring jewell to furnish coke as mclouth ordered it and to build replacement or new production facilities as needed to accomplish same he reserved for later adjudication any jewell claims of production cost increases due to inflation or antipollution laws he also reserved computation of mclouths claims for breach of contract damages and jewells counterclaims for similar damages he then certified that the judgment was a final one and that there was no just reason for delay of this appeal under rule b  this case reminds us of stories from the klondike gold rush of partners who willingly shared danger cold and starvation in the search for gold and then fought sometimes to the death for sole possession of the gold strike with which fortune favored them  here in the early s at a time when the coal industry was greatly depressed mclouth steel co contracted with jewell smokeless coal corp for jewell to build a coke plant and furnish coke to mclouth for  years the contract being renewable at mclouths option for another  years the unilateral nature of the option which is now the major source of controversy is explicable in that jewell in the midst of lean years approached mclouth with the proposal that mclouth give it a binding contract for coke which would provide jewell with the necessary cash flow to secure the capital required to build a coke plant the parties lived under the contract without major dispute until coal once more became king of the energy producers of the united states and its value went up in multiples then suddenly mclouth wanted to buy more coke than it had ever bought and jewell wanted to supply much less each as might be guessed found reasons this bitter controversy resulted  we find it impossible to describe the contract which is the center of this litigation without employing words which have interpretative shadings in view of its relative brevity we quote it in full with the paragraphs which we believe to be critical emphasized  this agreement made and entered into this st day of august  by and between jewell smokeless coal corporation a corporation organized under the laws of the state of virginia with an office in knoxville tennessee hereinafter called the seller and mclouth steel corporation a corporation with an office in detroit michigan hereinafter called the buyer witnesseth  that the seller hereby agrees to sell and the

excess of said purchases from semetsolvay division allied chemical corporation will average approximately  net tons of coke per month and buyer agrees that in no case shall purchases from seller

circumstance beyond either partys reasonable control shall not subject such party to any liability to the other party hereto  buyer shall have the right to purchase from other sources any part of buyers coke requirements which seller shall fail to supply buyer  in witness whereof the parties hereto have set their hands and seals the day and year first above written  emphasis added history of the  contract  the record discloses that prior to the signing of this contract jewell was in the business of processing cleaning and selling high grade low sulphur metallurgical coal from mines which it held under leases prior to  it had never been in the business of producing blast furnace coke a material which plaintiff mclouth used in great quantity for firing its furnaces  faced with losses in  and an excess of current liabilities over current assets in  the thompson family which owned controlling interests in and ran jewell and its affiliated coal companies contacted mclouth and initiated discussions of jewells undertaking to build a coke plant and supply a portion of mclouths needs for coke the contracting parties understood from these discussions that if jewell built the plant it would need to borrow capital therefor and that the contract would have to contain a minimum take or pay monthly tonnage purchase guarantee from mclouth to jewell all through the negotiations jewell was informed and understood that mclouth already had a year contract with semetsolvay division of allied chemical corporation for mclouth to purchase  tons of the coke it used each month from semetsolvay when it developed that  tons take or pay would probably serve to provide sufficient cash flow for financing the necessary coke plant construction loan for jewell the last sentence of the contract paragraph labeled quantity was drafted by mclouth  mclouth drafted this in terms of buyers requirements of blast furnace coke in excess of the amount which it is presently obligated to purchase from semetsolvay division and concluded with its estimate buyers requirements in excess of said purchases from semetsolvay division allied chemical corporation will average approximately  net tons of coke per month and buyer agrees that in no case shall purchases from seller hereunder average less than  net tons per month  with this contract in hand jewell proceeded to secure the necessary financing from aetna insurance company and to build  mitchelltype nonrecovery coke ovens at a site in vansant virginia which ovens had an approximate capacity of  to  tons of coke per month operations under the contract continued with both parties in reasonable accord as to its operation for some years  in  jewell without consulting mclouth or seeking any contract amendment expanded its coke capacity to between  to  tons of coke per month by adding  ovens of a different type in  mclouth ordered and jewell supplied an average of  tons per month  in  and  however mclouth advised thompson of jewell that its monthly requirements would be substantially increased as a result of a changeover to a continuous casting process and discussed with him the expansion of jewells coke facilities so as to provide an estimated  tons per month mclouth and jewell tentatively agreed to amend the  contract by changing  to  tons and  to  tons thus doubling the minimum take or pay and doubling the estimate in the old contract although there were serious discussions about amendment of the contract to this purpose they broke down on disagreements on other terms meantime relying on mclouths commitment to amend the contract jewell proceeded to build additional capacity up to  tons a month without outside financing the  contract was never formally amended but mclouth exercised its option to extend it for the second year period  during the first six months of  the district judge found jewell shipped to mclouth an average of  tons of coke per month partly from the new ovens which it had built which were known as plant no  thereafter the situation concerning this contract changed markedly in two important respects first jewell became acutely aware partly as a result of consulting stone  webster of the possibility that it could sell coke on the open market in excess of its contract price plus escalation with mclouth second mclouth which had up to then recognized the need to amend the contract to secure jewells commitment to supply  tons per month began to demand  tons per month as a matter of right under the  contract  additionally the air pollution laws of the state of virginia and the federal government began to appear ominously upon the horizon the virginia air pollution control board entered an order requiring jewell to cease and desist operating plant no  by july  and jewell argued before this court that plant no  might be similarly affected by virginias air pollution standards with this outline of the history of this contract we turn to the most important of the legal issues  the district judges findings and conclusions  the district judge held that the contract we have printed above was a requirements contract that it was unambiguous that it was executed in michigan and should be interpreted in accordance with michigan law and that under it jewell was obligated to meet all of mclouths increased requirements which mclouth now estimates at  tons per month he also held that if the virginia air pollution standards or those of the federal government require replacing old cokemaking facilities and building new facilities jewell is required by its contract so to do in all these respects the district judge held for mclouth adding only that if after expansion of facilities it developed that higher construction costs demanded by the necessity of installing machinery to meet air pollution standards imposed an unconscionable burden jewell could move under paragraph  of the judgment entered by the district court for a price adjustment to meet said situation needless to say appellee mclouth supports the district judge in all of these respects appellants contentions  jewell contends that in the first instance the district judge erred in determining the contract to be a requirements contract and particularly erred in ignoring the  ton per month estimate contained therein turning it into a total requirements contract which mclouth now estimates may ultimately mean  tons per month which mclouth may need and jewell under terms of the judgment would be obligated to supply  jewell contends the district judge erred in interpreting the contract under michigan law arguing that it was finally executed in connecticut where the last conditions were fulfilled by aetnas agreement to provide the financing  jewell also argues that the district court erred in ignoring the large mass of parol evidence and holding that the contract did not need explanation by parol evidence since it was unambiguous  in addition jewell contends that the contract should be construed as an agreement for jewell to supply mclouth from the production  to  tons of the mitchell ovens only and that since these ovens can no longer be operated legally the contract is terminated  additionally jewell argues that the district judge has failed to give effect to the portion of the contract which exempted the seller from liability for failure to deliver based upon action by any governmental authority having jurisdiction in the premises or any circumstance beyond either partys reasonable control and cites in this regard the impact of the federal environmental protection laws and the virginia air pollution control standards  finally by motion for rehearing filed after the district judges findings of fact and conclusions of law had been entered jewell argues that the  contract as interpreted and proposed to be enforced by the district judge represented an acquisition of all of jewells assets by mclouth and thus violated §§  and  of the clayton act  usc §§    and §  of the sherman antitrust act  usc §    is this contract subject to michigan law  taking the issues of this case in logical sequence and stating them as we see them we note the district judges conclusions pertaining to the law which controls interpretation of this contract  michigan conflict of laws rules apply klaxon co v stentor co  us   s ct   l ed   under michigan law interpretation of contract provisions are governed by the law of the state in which the contract was entered into chrysler corporation v insurance co of no america  f supp  edmich rubin v gallagher  mich    nw   in michigan a contract is deemed to be made in the state where the last act necessary to make it a binding agreement took place state of ohio v eubank  mich   nw   the last necessary act for the formation of the  agreement between these parties took place in the state of michigan when murphy of mclouth signed the agreement that had already been executed in the state of tennessee insertion of the words the first in the quantity clause of the contract by murphy did not serve to modify the contract nor did it constitute a counter offer this is so because the parties thereafter in writing and by their conduct treated the insertion of these words as a minor change or a slight change which did not affect the substance of the provision and only served to clarify the words immediately following dx   williston a treatise on the law of contracts section   jaeger ed  therefore this agreement was consummated in michigan and is governed by the laws of the state of michigan  we agree with the district judges conclusion on this point under these facts it is clear to us that appellants contention that the district court had no jurisdiction over jewell is erroneous  is the contract unambiguous as viewed by the district judge on this issue the district judge held  the language in the contract binding upon these parties is unambiguous and therefore must be given its natural and ordinary meaning a court may not strain interpretation to find ambiguity where none exists elstonrichards storage co v indemnity insurance co  f supp  wdmich muir v leonard refrigerator co  mich    nw   new amsterdam co v sokolowski  mich    nwd   the parol evidence rule applies after it is established that the written contract is a complete and final expression of the agreement between the parties such an agreement may not be varied or contradicted by proof of an antecedent agreement or prior negotiations the written contract supersedes and nullifies prior negotiations and antecedent agreements or understandings the sole purpose for allowing jewell to submit parol evidence was to permit jewell to prove its contention that the language in the written contract was latently ambiguous goodwin v coe pontiac  mich   nwd   such evidence did not establish an ambiguity and therefore may not now be considered to vary or contradict the plain meaning of the words used in the contract between these parties  we do not agree  the district judges entire findings of fact conclusions of law and declaratory judgment rely upon one sentence of the contract  the coke to be purchased hereunder shall be buyers requirements of blast furnace coke in excess of the amount which it is presently obligated to purchase from semetsolvay division allied chemical corporation  the district judge construed this sentence to represent an undertaking on jewells part to furnish any and all coke over  tons required by mclouth for a period of  years in the event mclouth exercised its option jewells undertaking according to the district judge was absolutely without limit he held that this sentence controlled regardless of other provisions of the contract or the then existing relationships of the parties or the then existing or foreseeable coke needs of mclouths plants or the nature and capacity of the coke production facilities which jewell was to construct or constructed or the amount of coal jewell and its affiliates were capable of mining or having mined or owned or had under lease in fact the district judge construed the contract so broadly in mclouths favor that he enjoined jewell to produce and sell to mclouth    all of mclouths blast furnace coke requirements in excess of  tons per month and to construct further additional coke producing facilities to satisfy such increase in mclouths requirements he also ordered that jewell even if it had first exhausted its own production satisfy mclouths requirements by the alternative means of the purchase of coke on the open market or the carbonization by others of coal from its reserves  we cannot find the contract described by the declaratory judgment of the district judge either in the four corners of the document itself or in the actions relationships words or writings of the parties  far from being unambiguous the contract which we quoted at the outset is actually beyond understanding if interpretation be confined to the words of the document the simplest illustration of this is that it is dated this st day of august  and contains as one critical sentence price  per net ton f o b cars at ovens vansant virginia even though no ovens existed in  it also says in the escalation clause coke plant labor shall also be escalated using as a base the wage scale in effect when the coke plant is placed in production the parties fully understood although the contingency was nowhere expressed in the document that the contract was not to be effective at all until and unless jewell with the mclouth  ton per month take or pay contract in hand succeeded in arranging the necessary financing for the construction of a then nonexisting coke plant it is clear on this record that jewell in  could not have built any coke plant at all absent the mclouth  ton take or pay guarantee  this is by no means the only gap or ambiguity in the contract which requires reference to the surrounding circumstances and the actions and positions of the parties the contract also provides the coal from which such coke is to be derived shall be from sellers present mines     the term present mines is not defined in any manner in the contract and evidence on that score would have to be supplied from outside the contract itself this is particularly true here where jewells mine holdings were and are exercised through a considerable number of affiliated companies and leases this provision also directly contradicts the portion of the district judges declaratory judgment which makes jewell responsible for purchasing coke or coal on the open market in order to supply whatever amount of coke mclouth might order jewell has never been in the coke brokerage business  the clause entitled contingencies particularly the phrase beyond either partys reasonable control bristles with ambiguity  additionally the contract includes as its last operative paragraph entitled contingencies buyer shall have the right to purchase from other sources any part of buyers coke requirements which seller shall fail to supply buyer we find here an explicit recognition of mclouths knowledge that the financing jewell would be seeking would be based on the  ton take or pay guarantee and that the plant would be built to supply the  ton estimate and not all of the coke mclouth might need in the course of  years reading this sentence together with the  ton take or pay provision and the  ton estimate of mclouths requirements from jewell in the quantity clause which we will deal with more fully in the next section of this opinion the contract cannot be properly defined or interpreted under michigan law without reference to the then existing and contemplated plant and equipment of both parties to the contract  in short we believe that the district judge was right when he spent  days of trial listening to all the circumstances surrounding this contract that he was likewise correct in relying on that mass of testimony in drawing his findings of fact but that he fell into legal error when he purported to base his conclusions of law solely upon the limited and frequently ambiguous words of the contract itself  in similar cases of ambiguity michigan law clearly provides for the courts taking and considering evidence pertaining to the situation of the parties at the point of contract and to their contemporaneous and subsequent expressions and actions interpreting the document in marx v american malting co  f  th cir  this court stated what we believe to be the michigan law applicable then and now to the evidentiary question here involved  but the court below took another view of the stipulations of this contract and held that the words amount of malt to be used will be between  and  bushels constituted a limitation upon the words quantity all their requirements to december   accordingly all evidence given or offered to show the conditions and circumstances in which the contract was made and in reference to which the parties were dealing was either directly or by the effect of instructions put aside there could be no complaint of this if the view which the court took of the contract was correct the evidence referred to however was for the information of the court and to enable it to rightly construe the agreement and the effect of the ruling was to say that the language was clear and no aid was needed to interpret it as we have said we reach a different conclusion we think such evidence was competent for the purpose for which it was offered it was not disputed and it disclosed highly important facts in aid of the right construction of the agreement we do not say that all of the evidence offered was admissible for this purpose mere words passing from one to another of the parties about matters which were subsequently reduced to writing were not admissible to alter cut down or enlarge the terms of the contract but whatever had reference to the conditions and the probable requirements of the business which the vendee expected and the knowledge of these conditions and expectations by the respective parties was admissible within the rule we think it was competent to prove by parol evidence that the vendor was informed of the conditions of the vendees business and of the enlargement of the plant and of the probable increase of the requirements resulting therefrom runkle v burnham  us    s ct   l ed  scott v united states  wall   l ed  bell v bruen  how   l ed  nash v towne  wall    l ed   cyc  where it is said  to determine the intention of the parties if the meaning is not clear it is necessary that regard shall be had to the nature of the instrument itself the condition of the parties executing it and the objects which they had in view for which purpose parol evidence is admissible  marx v american malting co supra at  emphasis added  is this an enforceable requirements contract under michigan law  we believe this contract in many ways is sui generis two of the biggest law firms in detroit have labored mightily to find michigan law which can be regarded as controlling and neither has presented a case which comes close to approximating the fact situation presented here the typical requirements contracts cases of the early s which were relied upon by the district judge and are mclouths primary reliance on this appeal involved contracts for one partys requirements of a certain product for a specific period of time usually a year or less most included an estimate of the amount of the product dealt in by the parties  it is clear to us as it was to the district judge that michigan case law up to the effective date of the michigan uniform commercial code in  has treated an estimate in a requirements contract as only that and not as a maximum figure or cap likewise preceding case law varied from the underlined portion of michcomplaws §   ucc   sec   output requirements a term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer means such actual output or requirements as may occur in good faith except that no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements may be tendered or demanded  emphasis added  michigan case law prior to  allowed enforcement of a good faith requirement which exceeded the contract estimate even if it could be termed unreasonably disproportionate to the estimate see marx v american malting co  f  th cir  e g dailey co v clark can co  mich   nw   f b holmes  co v city of detroit  mich   nw   menominee lumber  cedar co v thomson  mich   nwd    in each of these cases however the emphasis of the court was upon the known or foreseeable quantity required by the buyer or produced by the seller the court looked to what the parties knew at the time of contract about each others plant or business rather than to any stated estimate  in f b holmes v city of detroit supra the court said  we find no difficulty in ascertaining the prime object and purpose of these parties as expressed in the writings considered they had in mind so many barrels of cement as the operations of this department would require during this period the exact amount of cement which would be required could not be known at the time of entering into the contract as the first meeting of the board of estimates does not occur until in march  f b holmes v city of detroit supra  mich at   nw at   in menominee lumber  cedar co v thomson supra the court said  the necessity of harvesting and storage was imperative and known to defendant who also knew that ice not requisitioned would be a total loss to plaintiff  menominee lumber  cedar co v thomson supra  mich at   nwd at   in marx v american malting co supra this court said  it is a fundamental rule in the interpretation of agreements that we should ascertain the prime object and purpose of the parties and in case of ambiguity produced by its minor provisions the latter should if possible be so construed as not to conflict with the main purpose it is clear enough that these parties had in mind not the sale of a certain number of bushels of malt but so much as the business of the vendee would require during the period mentioned  marx v american malting co supra at   in e g dailey co v clark can co supra the supreme court of michigan said  many of the improvements now complained of were either then completed or were in progress at the time the contract was made there is evidence to show that clark knew of these improvements that he went through plaintiffs plant that he congratulated plaintiffs manager dailey upon the increase of business that dailey informed him that its business was growing that he wanted a contract to deliver him just as many cans as were needed and that dailey told him the company contemplated building a new brick building so as to further extend the business  e g dailey co v clark can co supra  mich at   nw at   we draw three legal principles from these cases the first is that in michigan prior to the uniform commercial code an estimate in a requirements contract did not control over the good faith needs of the ordering party the second is that good faith need would be judged by the courts on the basis of what each contracting party knew about the nature of the others business at the point of contract the third principle is that requirements contracts were legally enforceable under michigan law in  and  when the mclouthjewell contract came into being  finally we observe that although the mclouthjewell contract is poles apart from the contracts illustrated above in quantity and value and time of performance we find no legal distinction which defeats its enforceability  what requirements are enforceable under the contract  the most difficult question we have to determine is the amount of coke which this contract requires jewell to deliver on mclouths demand in this regard we look to the contract itself the parties known or reasonably foreseeable needs or capabilities and the interpretation of the contract by the parties themselves in the course of its performance  there were four definable stages of contract performance which require consideration they may be designated by the year concerned the  stage  neither party to this dispute denies that the contract which we have quoted in full above was entered into freely and that it became enforceable at least by  when the  mitchell ovens were built and placed in operation as of then jewell could have required mclouth to take and pay for the minimum  tons per month of coke provided in the contract and mclouth could have demanded that jewell provide it with all of the coke the mitchell ovens were capable of producing a figure which this record establishes at between  and  tons per month  the only basis on which jewell now seeks to avoid its commitment to supply mclouth with the approximate tonnage referred to immediately above is because of virginia air pollution controls this issue has yet to be tried and we do not purport to make any disposition of it we do however agree with the district judge that no facts currently before us serve to terminate jewells obligation to perform the contract absent future proofs of impossibility  in short to the extent that the district judges declaratory judgment applied to the originally developed production of  to  tons of coke per month we regard the district judges order enforcing the contract as valid this tonnage is consistent with the specific wording of the contract it is in reasonable accord with the  ton estimate contained therein although michigan law in  did not require such accord it is consistent with the foreseeable needs of the mclouth operation as of the time of the signing of the contract it is also consistent with the interpretation of the parties themselves in carrying the contract into effect the record is clear that jewell readily complied with mclouths orders up to and exceeding  tons the  stage  the critical feature of this contract dispute concerns whether or not the conduct of the parties between  and  shows that the parties themselves interpreted the contract as calling for additional tonnage up to  tons per month the district judges findings which are fully supported by the evidence on this score include these facts  mclouth in  without any basic change in plant increased its orders to jewell to an average of  tons per month  jewell without consulting mclouth built  additional australiantype ovens at the vansant site  jewell received and supplied mclouths requirements for coke up to the  figure and  both parties clearly relied on the  contract for such important matters as price quality and delivery in the furnishing and receipt of the  tons of coke  the michigan supreme court provides this statement concerning the importance of the construction of a contract by the parties actual performance under it  it is to be assumed that parties to a contract know best what was meant by its terms and are the least likely to be mistaken as to its intention that each party is alert to protect his own interests and to insist on his rights and that whatever is done by the parties during the period of the performance of the contract is done under its terms as they understood and intended it should be parties are far less likely to have been mistaken as to the meaning of their contract during the period when they are in harmony and practical construction reflects that meaning than when subsequent differences have impelled them to resort to law and one of them then seeks a construction at variance with their earlier practical construction of its provisions  detroit greyhound employees federal credit union v aetna life ins co  mich    nwd    quoting  amjurd contracts §  at    since the parties themselves freely construed this contract to require delivery of  tons of coke we hold the contract is also enforceable up to this quantity the  stage  starting in  mclouth launched a major change in its steelmaking processes it spent well over  to change over to a continuous casting system concast thus increasing its steelmaking capacity and increasing its need for coke in  mclouth initiated discussions with jewell to increase jewells productive capacity to  tons per month which mclouth felt it would need mclouth recognized concurrently with the development of the continuous casting plan that the additional tonnage which mclouth would want from jewell as a result of the concast development would require a new or amended contract in contrast to the  australiantype ovens which jewell built on its own initiative mclouth this time initiated discussion of jewells expansion what follows is  correspondence between the principal negotiator for mclouth g e gann and the principal negotiator for jewell b r thompson plus an internal memorandum from gann to other mclouth executives which demonstrate conclusively that both parties considered further tonnage expansion to be beyond the terms of the  agreement thus on april   in a mclouth internal memorandum after discussing the possibility of increasing the  tons per month from semetsolvay by another  tons gann turned to consideration of jewell as a prospective supplier for its increased needs and said as follows  the balance of our coke requirements up to  tons per month comes from jewell smokeless coal company on a long term contract ending may   the current price delivered is  also subject to escalation this contract covers all our requirements in excess of the  net tons presently obligated to semetsolvay up to their plant capacity or their ability to produce  jewell smokeless is faced with an air pollution problem that is synonymous with the small mitchell type bee hive oven that he now operates the best way and the cheapest way to lick this problem is to convert all his ovens to the large australian sole flue type ovens which would simplify his smoke problem one hundred of these big ovens would permit him to increase his monthly production rate to above  net tons more than enough to take care of any foreseeable increase in requirements by us  on may   gann wrote thompson the following letter  as a result of our many conversations and discussions about our future coke requirements and the extent of jewell smokeless participation we would like to confirm the following understanding  a from now till june   mclouth will commit to jewell smokeless all of their coke requirements over and above the  tons monthly now committed to semet solvay  b beginning july   mclouth will commit to jewell smokeless all of their coke requirements over and above  tons monthly that will then be committed to semet solvay  these commitments of course will be contingent on the ability of jewell smokeless to perform and assurance to this affect must be forthcoming as soon as possible  under the terms of our present contract we are committed for  to  tons per month we agree our new contract should read  to  tons per month  it would be our intention to simply amend our present contract to cover these changes and to incorporate any other thinking that we might mutually agree upon  in response to ganns may  letter on november   thompson wrote gann as follows  please be advised that jewell smokeless coal corporation has begun construction of  coke ovens size  x  to enable us to manufacture approximately  to  tons of coke per month and we anticipate now that production will begin twelve to fifteen months from this date our exact target date will depend as you know on the availability of materials  we are embarking on this construction program based on your assurance that our supply contract with you dated august   will be amended so as to increase the maximum tons to be purchased thereunder from  tons of coke per month to  tons of coke per month and the minimum to be purchased from  tons per month to  tons per month  we trust that the above is the assurance which you requested of this company in your letter of may    while the letters we have quoted would seem to indicate that both parties were in mutual agreement concerning the new contract the facts proved to be quite different mclouth wanted the contract to be increased to the new quantities at the original  base price plus escalation it also wanted to continue semetsolvay as the supplier of first choice from whom mclouth was obligated to buy the first  or  tons of coke jewell wanted an increase in the per ton price of coke and wanted to be on a parity with semetsolvay in the event mclouth again faced months or years of lower production and lower demand for coke these conflicts were never resolved and no amended contract let alone new contract was ever signed the fact that agreement was not reached does not however alter the mutual recognition in  that the  contract could not properly be construed to cover the mclouth needs produced by the concast system the litigation stage  until now  the coke ovens called plant  which jewell started to build in  in reliance on mclouths promise to amend the contract were completed by  they were built with a technology aimed at compliance with environmental laws they increased jewells coke production by  tons for a time jewell supplied mclouths increased needs from plant  also in the first six months of  the district judge found jewell shipped an average of  tons of coke per month  the parties were however moving farther apart in their interpretation of the contract jewell aware of higher prices for coke on the spot market began selling coke to others some on longterm contracts and began telling mclouth it could not meet mclouths needs mclouth began to take the position regardless of the prior negotiations to amend the contract that it was entitled to all the coke it ordered from jewell on june   it wrote jewell a letter ordering  tons of coke per month under the terms of our contract jewell refused to supply this quantity and after further unsuccessful negotiations mclouth filed the instant complaint on december    pending this litigation the parties continued in business together as a result of what they called a tire patch agreement negotiated may   at least through  jewell has been supplying up to  tons of coke per month on mclouths orders the tire patch agreement however was made without prejudice to the opposing claims of the parties in this dispute  we have previously held that the mclouthjewell contract was an enforceable requirements contract under michigan law we now add that the evidence concerning the needs of mclouth as determined by its steelmaking processes in  and the capability of jewell as determined at the same time plus the evidence concerning how the parties themselves interpreted the contract in  and  necessitate the holding that the  average monthly tonnage found by the district judge for  is the maximum tonnage which under michigan law is enforceable under this contract the contingencies clause  the district judge found and we agree that the  order of the virginia air pollution board upon which appellant jewell relies and which has been stayed pending this appeal should not be regarded as excusing jewells performance of this contract because of the force majeure provisions contained therein  the contract provision at issue reads as follows  contingencies it is understood that sellers failure to deliver or buyers failure to accept said coke in the event and during the continuance of any action by governmental authority whether now or hereafter effective preventing performance of this agreement in accordance with its terms or failure to make or accept deliveries hereunder when due if occasioned by act of god or the public enemy fire explosion flood war riots sabotage strike action of any governmental authority having jurisdiction in the premises or any circumstance beyond either partys reasonable control shall not subject such party to any liability to the other party hereto  clearly to this date no final order by any governmental authority having jurisdiction in the premises has prevented jewells compliance with this contract nor is there any certainty on this record that any governmental authority will in the future the remedy  the district judge found and we agree that the mclouthjewell contract did not contain any limitation of jewells supply of coke to mclouth to any particular plant clearly jewell did not construe the contract as limited to the mitchell ovens it voluntarily and repeatedly shipped to mclouth from other of its coke plant facilities  the district judges declaratory judgment presumably because it found this contract to be a requirements contract without any limit specifically orders jewell to build new coke plant facilities in compliance with virginia air pollution standards to replace the  mitchell ovens or to purchase coke on the open market to fulfill this contract  we see no need at this juncture to face all of the questions which this order would produce the courts declaratory judgment which we are affirming mandatorily enjoins jewell and its officers and agents to continue to perform this contract we have now affirmed this judgment with a maximum which mclouth can demand under the contract of  tons per month  we doubt that enforcement of this judgment as modified will prove to be a problem however if it does contempt proceedings and money damages should prove an adequate remedy jewell surely is collectible damages  we also note the district judges extensive conclusions of law on past contract damage claims these claims have yet to be heard and we decline to review the legal conclusions submitted until the hearing record on damages is completed the declaratory judgment  for the reasons stated above the declaratory judgment is affirmed but only to the extent set forth and as modified see italics below the balance of the declaratory judgment is vacated the declaratory judgment as modified is as follows declaratory judgment count i  permanent injunction pursuant to findings of fact and conclusions of law  entered august    this cause came on to be heard for trial on the verified amended complaint of plaintiff mclouth steel corporation mclouth and the court having heard and considered oral and documentary evidence and having separately filed on may   its findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to  frcivp as to the issues of contract interpretation and liabilities under count i of the amended complaint and the amended counter claim herein  now therefore it adjudged and decreed that declaratory relief  the  agreement hereinafter the agreement is binding upon mclouth and defendants jewell coal and coke company and the present jewell smokeless coal corporation collectively referred to as jewell  this agreement between mclouth and jewell is a requirements contract executed under the law of michigan pursuant to the terms of this agreement jewell is obligated upon reasonable advance notice from mclouth to sell and mclouth is obligated to buy from jewell until april   all of mclouths requirements of blast furnace coke in excess of  tons per month up to a maximum of  tons per month the agreement neither expressly nor impliedly designates a specific battery of ovens nor any other specific asset of jewell as the sole equipment from which jewell is to fulfill mclouths requirements such blast furnace coke is to be of the quality specified in the agreement and is to be sold under the terms of the agreement pertaining to prices escalation duration deliveries weights payments and contingencies permanent injunction  jewell shall commencing on the date hereof and continuing through april   produce and sell to mclouth and mclouth shall buy from jewell all of mclouths blast furnace coke requirements in excess of  tons per month up to a maximum of  tons per month such blast furnace coke is to be of the quality specified in the agreement and it is to be sold under all of the terms of the agreement pertaining to price escalation duration deliveries weights payment and contingencies  in the event that in any month jewell shall be unable to perform its obligation as construed herein mclouth shall have the right to obtain furnace coke from sources other than jewell in sufficient quantity to make up the difference between the quantity shipped to mclouth in that month by jewell and mclouths requirements less  tons any differential between the contract price and the delivered price paid for the coke purchased in accordance with this paragraph shall be adjusted between the parties in the following month by adding to or subtracting from the total payment to be made by mclouth to jewell in that month mclouth shall make available for inspection by jewell at mclouths offices in detroit all invoices freight bills and shipping records relating to any such cover purchases  in the event that jewell asserts that the cost of compliance with its obligation to supply coke as set forth herein will cause an unconscionable burden upon it jewell shall be afforded an opportunity to introduce evidence to establish its costs to supply the coke required under the agreement provided however that jewell can first establish that it has in making such deliveries exhausted its entire production capacity from its existing facilities and provided further that any additional coke which it supplied was in fact supplied by the least expensive means available if such cost for delivery after compliance with these provisions is so substantially disproportionate to the price then being paid under the agreement as to create an unconscionable result as asserted by jewell the court may adjust the price to be paid for such coke supplied to avoid such result  during the remaining duration of the agreement the defendants their directors officers agents employees and attorneys and all other persons in active concert or active participation with them to whom knowledge of the order shall come shall absolutely desist and refrain from  a terminating delaying interrupting or otherwise failing the making of regular and timely sales to mclouth of the quantities of coke ordered by mclouth up to the maximum specified herein  b in any way harassing threatening and attempting to intimidate or economically coerce mclouth with respect to termination delay or interruption of regular and timely deliveries of all coke required to be sold under the terms of the agreement  while we have already clearly implied rejection of appellant jewells remaining issues we deal briefly with them below remaining issues  we perceive no law or logic to support appellant jewells argument that the virginia air pollution control board is a necessary party to this purely contractual dispute  we find no merit to appellants claim that this contract as interpreted above creates or tends to create any monopoly in the coke market  the disposition we have indicated above also serves to moot appellants contention that mclouth by this contract has violated the antitrust laws by acquiring jewell  we find no merit to appellant jewells contention that mclouth is barred from equitable relief by the fact that at times in the life of the instant contract it bought coke from other suppliers than jewell the findings of fact of the district judge on this issue are not clearly erroneous  further the mclouthjewell contract guaranteed jewell only  tons per month and did not exclude mclouths purchases from others of coke which jewell could not or did not supply any claims that mclouth violated the contract to jewells damage by failing to order its actual requirements over  tons may be adjudicated in the hearing on damages  the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion  honorable alfonso j zirpoli senior united states district judge for the northern district of california sitting by designation  jewell was originally jewell smokeless coal corporation in  its name was changed to jewell coal and coke company and jewell smokeless coal corporation smokeless was formed since then jewells business has been the production and sale of coke and smokeless has held the coal leases operated the coal cleaning and preparation equipment and performed the coal sales  jewell also poured foundations for  other ovens for possible future expansion  there was clearly ample evidence of both contract and contact in michigan to establish the courts jurisdiction over jewell and to apply michigan law to this controversy michcomplaws ann §§    southern machine co v mohasco industries inc  fd  th cir  inflight devices corp v van dusen air inc

acquisition of southwestern virginia coal properties globenewswire mar    pm edt lexington ky march   globe newswire  ramaco resources inc nasdaqmetc ramaco announced today that it has entered into various agreements acquiring through its subsidiary ramaco resources land holdings llc approximately  acres of coal properties in tazewell and buchanan counties virginia and mcdowell county west virginia from jewell ridge coal corporation jewell ridge an indirect subsidiary of the brinks company  as part of the transaction ramaco acquired several coal leaseholds adjacent to its knox creek operations among the assets acquired ramaco became the sublessor of revelation energy llc revelation which now operates several underground coal mines formerly owned by a subsidiary of suncoke energy inc suncoke and which still supply coal to suncokes nearby jewell coke plant however ramaco also acquired significant properties that are not subleased to revelation in close proximity to ramacos knox creek preparation plant and norfolk southern loadout which may be developed in the future in addition to receiving royalty income from the acquired properties ramaco will immediately begin planning development of those portions of the properties not currently subleased to revelation  ramacos management estimates that the acquisition will yield approximately  million mineable tons of metallurgical coal once exploration and reserve analysis efforts are completed  ramaco intends to enter into additional subleases with neighboring coal operators as well as develop its own mid and lowvolatile metallurgical coal mines  ramaco will also explore the potential for remining two existing coal refuse areas which could contain saleable metallurgicalquality material which was a byproduct of processing coal prior to the implementation of more modern coal processing technology michael bauersachs ramacos president and chief executive officer noted that ramacos strong balance sheet was the key driver in completing this transaction  we were able to provide proper assurance to both jewell ridge and our new lessors of our ability to perform in the future which was critical given our posture as a relatively new coal producer  this transaction meets our disciplined criteria of acquiring metallurgical coal reserves near existing operations at a low cost of entry trending

relating to the liability of directors these provisions eliminate a director’s personal liability for monetary damages resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty except in circumstances involving a breach of the director’s duty of loyalty acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law section  of the dgcl pertaining to unlawful dividends or a transaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit the principal effect of the limitation on liability provision is that a stockholder will be unable to prosecute an action for monetary damages against a director unless the stockholder can demonstrate a basis for liability for which indemnification is not available under the dgcl these provisions however should not limit or eliminate our rights or a stockholder’s right to seek nonmonetary relief such as an injunction or rescission in the event of a breach of fiduciary duty by directors these provisions do not alter a director’s liability under federal securities laws the inclusion of this provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may discourage or deter stockholders or
