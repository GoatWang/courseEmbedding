expedited review by delaware court of chancery for lawsuit against allscripts healthcor obtains expedited review by delaware court of chancery for lawsuit against allscripts may    et from healthcor management lp new york may   prnewswire  healthcor management lp healthcor today announced that the delaware court of chancery has granted its motion for an expedited hearing on  the complaint healthcor filed against allscripts healthcare solutions inc nasdaq mdrx allscripts or the company  the court has established a hearing date of june    healthcor stated the following we are pleased that the court has agreed to hear our arguments on an expedited basis  we are bringing this action because the termination of the companys chairman and resignation of three other board members – which occurred after the deadline for stockholders to nominate director candidates for the  annual meeting – we believe constitutes a material and dramatic change to the balance of governance at allscripts  accordingly healthcor contends that an extension of the nomination deadline as well as a delay of the allscripts annual meeting is necessary so that all stockholders be given a fair opportunity to nominate director candidates and exercise their voting rights at this critical time of transition for the company we believe that the potential value of allscripts is significantly higher than the current public valuation  however despite the companys significant underperformance poor execution and internal turmoil the allscripts board has taken no decisive actions to address the considerable issues facing the company and has moved only to entrench itself further  change is clearly needed on the allscripts board and if healthcor is successful in its actions it intends to nominate a slate of three directors in order to provide stockholders the ability to make a meaningful choice at the annual meeting as previously disclosed healthcor filed the lawsuit on may   seeking among other things an extension of the nomination deadline that the allscripts  annual meeting be enjoined to allow stockholders who wish to propose a dissident slate a sufficient period of time to solicit proxies in support of their candidates and that allscripts be required to set a record date for a date after the public disclosure of the boardlevel leadership dispute  richards layton  finger and
