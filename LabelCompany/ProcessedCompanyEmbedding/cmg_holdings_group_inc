to bring cmg shareholders up to date with the most recent company events on june   cmg filed an amended complaint against former employees and officers of xa and the entities owned by them cmg has been grievously harmed by the actions of this group and is determined to make certain this harm is repaired lawrence steckman the attorney representing cmg in this matter is widely admired for his expertise and experience prosecuting civil racketeering cases worldwide and has published extensively on the subject it is his opinion that the case filed on behalf of cmg in new yorks state supreme court against the former employees and officers of xa meets all the qualifications and requirements for a successful and sustained civil rico complaint cmg through the filing of this suit seeks judgment against former xa executives and staff including but not limited to treble damages attorneys fees and other costs under the rico statute in other news cmg has been in discussions with a number of groups pertaining to its subsidiary good gaming an esports gaming and tournament site that targets amateur gamers in late december  good gaming held a recordbreaking debut tournament in coordination with activision blizzard  but as a consequence of cash flow issues related to the massive conversion of assets by the defendants in the pending rico case was forced to throttle back spending on this exciting new startup in the intervening months good gaming has been working inhouse on refining its product and developing new ideas and applications while searching for additional investment  in addition to exploring the creation of a spinoff for good gaming in which cmg would maintain a substantial piece of the new entity formed as our longterm stockholders know until mid xa was an essential asset of cmg with millions of dollars in revenue we anticipate that a successful judgment against the defendants of the current lawsuit will repair a substantial amount of the damage xa suffered as a result of their actions when i accepted the position of chairman at cmg holdings in in april  i had no way of knowing what damage had been done to cmg by a cabal of faithless xa employees over the course of a six year conspiracy  nor any idea that in the first four weeks of my tenure these same employees would complete their devastating plunder of cmg through a series of coordinated thefts and resignations i have spent the last year reviewing and collating the evidence they left behind with a view towards bringing them to justice and restoring the losses shareholders have suffered as a result after months working for no salary against headwinds that sometimes seemed impossible to master it appears cmg may finally be on the verge of profitability and success due in large part to the steadfast belief of our loyal shareholders the determination of a dedicated group of good gaming and new xa staffers and the talents of one of the most respected names in the legal profession  good gaming inc model discussion by vik grover ggis new ceo  hdsi now let’s get down to some math while these are not projections i want to illustrate to you  how powerful the good gaming model is i want to run  scenarios by you so grab your pens  or prepare to type  first our model has multiple revenues streams subscriptions which you can assume for  now at roughly month depending on where we end up pricing the product with  incentives promotions and other tournament entries which we estimate subscribers will  pay anywhere from tournament although frankly i think this can range a lot higher as the  business matures purchases of good gaming credits to use in our mercenary system which  we believe will range between month though we have no data to backup this  prediction and  advertising which is hard to pin down since our members may spend days  and days on our site versus social networking sites which get  minutes a day per user but  let’s call that for now another month with potential upside that adds up to roughly   month per subscriber for many reasons i believe these numbers could be conservative  and over time i predict the results will bear out a higher yield as our site gets populated but  for our math next i will use month per month per subscriber  scenario  we have about k followers of our twitter feed k x month  mm in  monthly revenues or a mm run rate company let’s round up to mm because  sometimes people will just play a tournament and not subscribe for whatever reason  dotcom’s of that revenue scale typically get lower multiples of xx so that’s a mm  market cap company this is something within reach of our business today based on the   tournament slots and our existing followers on twitter it may prove conservative  scenario  in  the  platform held a tournament for hearthstone that was up on the  burner page for  days generating k hits we were promised  days but were cut short  due to a scheduling issue let’s run with k hits which we believe we could have converted  to subscribers if our parent had not run into difficulties and we had been able to run multiple  additional tournaments as we are positioned now over a year later k x month   mm per month or mm per year rounding up to mm for players that do not subscribe  for whatever reason dotcom’s of that scale get a revenue multiple of xx which would  make good gaming a mm market cap company    scenario  using a conservative ½ share of the mm amateur gamer market worldwide as  a base case that suggests roughly  million subscribers mm x month   million  per month or  million per year again this excludes gamers who do not subscribe to our  site and just show up to play tournaments without subscribing let’s call that mm a year of  annual revenue which may be conservative at ½ share of the worldwide market this  suggests good gaming will generate mm in annual revenues and at that scale we project  significant double digit cash flow margins multiples applied to internet companies of that scale  range from xx suggesting a valuation of bn  i wanted to give you a fourth and fifth scenario targeting  of today’s market ranging up to   of a mm gamer market in  years with higher monthly revenues per subscriber of   i was told by mr laken i couldn’t go that far but i have given you the metrics off  which you can make your own model at least as far as revenues go i want to point out that i  believe this is a rising arpu situation where the monthsubscriber will rise to  or more  when we are running  tournaments a week for multiple titles multiple publishers  the numbers are going to get staggering and i want to make one other point my scenarios do  not include any bb deals for licensing or white label whereby we can take our model to a  colleges and universities or a broad range of institutions and offer them the chance to run their  own competitions that’s where the math gets even more nutty but you have to imagine  what that could be worth – good gaming could become the backend for esports tournaments  for major channel partners the upside is staggering and if i say any more you’re going to think  it is just silly   cmgo management glenn laken   member of the board chairman of the board and chief executive officer ceo on april   the board of directors the board of cmg holdings group inc cmg holdings or the the company

it is debt free httpwwwsecgovarchivesedgardatafkformcmgohtm   cmg holdings group inc quick background summary fergusvi the company first caught my eye in february   this is when creative management group inc was reverse merged into pebble beach enterprises inc  there was a change in control a name change to cmg holdings inc  this company was run by the old management alan morell mike vandetty and jim ennis  the future looked bright and the os was around m   they quickly acquired the assets of xa the experiential agency in march  this was exciting because xa was a proven revenue driver the company has been around since  through all markets  xa proved to be their main revenue source as the talent management and commercial rights segments produced very little income  old management started issuing convertible notes most likely to pay their large salaries of yr  in march  they closed on the audioeye acquisition  they paid k cash  million in shares and deferred capital commitments of  million over a few years  although the ip and patents ae possesed at the time were valuable and had good independent valuations history shows that they were ahead of the curve with this purchase and they had a hard time funding ae as ae wasnt able to generate much revenue at that time  it was also difficult to finance a subsidiary under the umbrella of the holding company so with this ae was eventually spun off and became an independent public company trading in the otc under symbol aeye  cmg at the time of spinoff was able to retire senior secured notes give shareholders a dividend and hold around m shares of ae on books and they also had revenue sharing  of future ae sales and revenue there is a lot im leaving out but essentially the company continued old management to issue more and more convertible notes  along the way many organized long shareholders were accumulating millions and millions of shares many from the toxic convertible sales the long shareholders had had enough and took matters into their own hands and effected a change in control and instituted new management and a new direction  since then new management has made some very shareholder friendly moves  mainly they took the company to debt free status as cited above from the jan   k  they also reduced the os substantially returned shares to the treasury and nullified other outstanding convertibles  they appointed powerhouse new management additions to the bod of cmgo and to xa  they acquired good gaming llc and are making an entrance into the ever growing esports sector  links to follow new management sold a portion of their aeye shares back to audioeye with these proceeds they paid off all debt and are debt free no convertible notes  they still retained about million shares of aeye on the books httpwwwsecgovarchivesedgardatafkformcmgohtm   shareholders take back control of company   cmgos recent change in control summary this is very rare in the otc markets   on november th  groups of organized long shareholders sent written correspondence to the then current management indicating they had  majority of the stock and wanted to ammend the corporate bylaws httpwwwsecgovarchivesedgardatafkformcmgohtm on december th  the majority shareholders were successful in taking back control of the company and appointing a new board of directors and giving current

increase in revenues revenues were already up in    months ending revenue million  they also informed shareholdes that ae dividend shares are with ta and ready for distribution around mid feb   also

httpwwwexperientialagencycom     esports subsidiary   good gaming inc      httpgoodgamingcom on twitter httpstwittercomgoodgaminginc on facebook httpswwwfacebookcomgoodgaminginc   i would like to address an affidavit against glenn laken that ive seen posted on this board on a couple of occasions the document filed was never meant for the purpose that was proported it was only drafted by the individual who was trying to hurt cmg its shareholders and the ceo barry mlot authored the affidavit for the sole purpose of getting it into the hands of the attornies representing the hudson gray defendants in the rico case glenn laken cmg and xa agency have ongoing in the courts well since that court filing sol mlot with full knowledge filed an affidavit on oct  establishing for the record to correct misinformation put before the public and expose his sons actions for including additional falsified addendums that again were never seen by sol mlot nor granted permission to incorporate in the subject affidavit i know this for a fact because i had the opportunity to read sol mlots recently filed affidavit almost a month ago i debated hard and long as to whether to go public with this information being that i knew it might cause embarrassment to a  year old man but i decided after having consulted with a friend whos an attorney that i couldnt stand by and watch the reputation of a person that ive known for years as being a hardworking respectable man get continually sullied any longer the irony here is that hes in possession of this affidavit and could have publicly presented it but abstained from doing so i on the other hand felt the record needed to be set straight so ive taken it upon myself to post it here i suggest those indiviuals concerned take a moment to read it and determine for yourselves who is the victim and who is the unscrupulous individual in this whole affair  united states district court southern district of new york     x  cmg holdings group inc as

thirdparty defendants          x  sol mlot declares under penalty of perjury under the laws of the united states as follows   i am a nonparty to this litigation i am providing this declaration to correct factual misrepresentations submitted supposedly in my name and by affidavit by defendants i have never seen certain documents defendants have attached to the subject affidavit and was never told by anyone that this affidavit would be submitted here i strenuously object to statements those who have submitted these documents pretend i support and they never even asked me whether i supported them   briefly mr glenn laken is a cmg principal and i have lived with ms anita laken mr  glenn lakens mother for about i  years my adult son barry mlot has since the beginning our relationship viewed anita as a threat to his inheritance and he has consistently sought to undermine our relationship barry was in fact the only person with access to the subject affidavit and i believe it was he who provided it defendants for his own perceived benefit   briefly  have traded stock for more than  years and i trade today   in april  i asked glenn if he would share his opinions on certain stocks with me and make suggestions as to stocks he thought had growth potential he mentioned cmg and i began to accumulate a position in it along with other recommended stocks   glenn was never my stockbroker he received no compensation from me for his advice    subsequently asked him to trade certain of my accounts and he agreed to do so again for no compensation some stocks glenn recommended began to lose money and i asked him if he would be willing to share in the losses of certain of them including cmg and tnib   he agreed to do so and on june   we memorialized our understanding regarding losssharing in a handwritten agreement   a dispute later developed between us as to which stocks were the subject of this agreement glenn recalling the agreement addressed losses in just cmg and tnib and me recalling the agreement was to cover all stocks glenn recommended or traded on my behalf   in july  barry inserted himself into this dispute and he began making accusations that glenn was manipulating cmgs stock price in response to among other things domestic disputes i was then having with anita i was unaware of any basis for his accusations and am unaware of any today   since i executed the affidavit i have barely communicated with barry it is clear to me that he secretly submitted this document as if he were me never seeking my permission to do so and istate categorically that iwould not have given such permission if asked   i never saw the twopage addendum·• annexed as exhibit  to my affidavi t which my affidavit pretends to ratify inever wrote it inever reviewed it inever approved it and ireject its many innuendos and falsehoods   i have never spoken to defendants·lawyers about this affidavit nor the attached two page addendum nor anything else ihave no idea why they would submit this in a litigation which as iunderstand it has nothing to do with me without contacting me to determine the facts and whether isupported doing so   the affidavit and its exhibit  presents a totally false impression of the facts   i regret that my sons connivance has caused hi m to engage in such behavior in his efforts to undermine mr laken and cmg
