based on a formula evaluating each prospective borrowers credit risk under the new approach lenders no longer determine the loan rate via price discovery in an auction instead they simply choose whether or not to invest at the rate which prospers loan pricing algorithm assigns to the loan after it analyzes the borrowers credit report and financial information the idea for the service is derived from group banking concepts such as rotating savings and credit associations other motivating ideas derive from the concepts of microlending and microfinance prosper publishes performance

cease and desist orderedit on november   the sec found prosper to be in violation of the securities act of  as a result of these findings the sec imposed a cease and desist order on prosper due primarily to the novel nature of the peertopeer lending models the sec after review now treats all peertopeer lending transactions as sales of securities and requires that all platforms register with the sec litigationedit on november   a class action lawsuit was filed against prosper in the superior court of california county of san francisco california the suit was brought on behalf of all loan note purchasers in prospers online lending platform from january   through october   and alleges that prosper offered and sold unqualified and unregistered securities in violation of the california and federal securities laws the lawsuit seeks class certification damages the right of rescission and the award of attorneys’ fees prospers insurer greenwich insurance company refused to pay for defense expenses claiming the matters involved were not covered by the insurance policy on december   judge richard a kramer of california superior court issued a tentative decision ruling for prosper on this limited issue and holding that greenwich is obligated to defend prosper in the classaction suit and to reimburse prospers litigation expenses so far although the decision did not rule on the lawsuit itself or address whether prosper might be entitled to insurance coverage in the event any of the lawsuits claims proved meritorious it relieved prosper of significant legal expenses in the

period they choose prosper reports a  annualized seasoned rate of return net of fees for all loans issued from its reopening after sec registration july   to the th of september  prospers returns for this period have been independently audited by ashland partners  company llp a number of factors including prospers decision to set the interest rates on all loans rather than let investors choose the rates they would accept occurred after prosper registered with the sec and began issuing new loan notes in july  additionally after prosper began setting the rates on all loans itself prosper

recommended reviewed november   loan type refinance services closed loan with this loan officer five star service   customer service like it’s supposed to be  exceptional my introduction to misty kay campbell was a few months ago when i coldcalled capwest mortgage to seek refinancing of my primary residence this was my first refinance as well as my first experience with a lesserknown financing company my previous experiences with mortgage companies when seeking primary funding for a home in years past were poor to say it kindly the most recent was with the mortgage division of a national credit card company whom i’d used for revolving credit for over  years that experience was terrible the closing was delayed  days due to a series of ineptness solely on their part worthy of a good comedy of errors misty and her team at capwest were nothing short of amazing putting aside the contrast between the two companies misty displayed many desirable qualities which few possess these days in any line of business she patiently listed to concerns and questions regarding the circumstances which complicated my refinancing then responded in a friendly and professionally manner in communication instances where i was unclear misty asked for clarification to ensure we understood one another i greatly appreciated the direct and honest way misty provided information and answers to each of my questions regardless of how trivial they may have seemed if she didn’t know something misty took note sought out the information and followed up promptly without me having to ask a second time another testament to misty’s attentiveness was her availability outside of business hours there were multiple occasions when she responded to email messages i had sent in her off hours and on weekends when i signed the closing documents after business hours she made herself available while i was with the notary via phone throughout the refinancing process misty made it seem tailormade to my situation rather than a series of steps which were required to get everything done in time for closing she is one of the few individuals one meets these days who takes pride in their work and cares about the customer when i’m in need of primary loan or refinancing in future years i will contact misty first capwest should be proud to have someone of her caliber in their employment  read more was this review helpful yes no lender review stephen from south haven mi  of  reviewed june   loan type home purchase services closed loan with this lender choose wisdom avoid prospect   i’ll keep this short to make it worth reading prospect has been terrible their rep was difficult to get ahold of and sluggish to move forward without prodding he made us miss the listed closing date and potentially lose the purchase once he finally got the inspection he failed to get me the closing numbers even the day of closing which he delayed to dec  because finding moving help is so simple over christmas he never got me the closing costs until at the signing i then had to drive to the closest bank to get the check and return to finish the deal furthermore he never checked the paperwork and found at pm the night before closing that the address on the loan didnt match the city records he barely made the closing and never even let me know if it all worked out when i called the day of he did not pick up or return the call just after closing we changed insurance companies and come to find out months later he never did the paperwork because he quit two weeks after closing and priority dropped the ball so because the escrow didnt pay which prospect required my insurance was dropped completely on the house i was then forced to pay for the new mortgage companys high premium insurance because prospect sold my loan the first month so prospect now says they cant help and the new lender wont either i eventually paid the entire year again out of pocket so my escrow is growing constantly and my closing payment just disappeared speaking with prospect they just blew me off asked to have some time to get the information then never got back to me they have terrible reps horrible follow through useless support and that is all assuming they dont just dish off your loan leaving you at the mercy of their choosing you have many mortgage options please choose wisely and avoid prospect read more was this review helpful yes no lender review guster from oakland ca  of  reviewed june   missed deadlines multiple times   overall prospect found a great rate and had come highly recommended from one of the agents we worked with we had some good conversations and felt comfortable going into the process unfortunately our mortgage was delayed  times each one more frustrating than the previous time first the appraiser they chose couldnt meet their deadline then the loan process took too long and finally the money wasnt transferred fast enough we were told that the lender paid money out of their own pocket to keep the deal going for the second delay although there were likely benefits to themselves better relationship with the sellers agent and making sure that the deal didnt fall through overall we would have preferred for them to negotiate but it was done without our full discussion and then finally at the last delay however the lender simply said im sorry that we couldnt do anything its out of our hands it was the underwriter  wire transfer time this delay only affected us the buyers and it was more clear where we stood in the process there was a certain amount of trust lost through the process and the final responses of the lender did not help did we like prospects rate yes were they responsive yes most of the time did they meet their timelines no almost none of them i wanted to be able to recommend them and if they had held to their final timeline it would have likely all resolved but the last one showed more of a pattern than we preferred and seeing yelp reviews of other offices outlined a number of the same issues read more was this review helpful yes no lender review voice from moultrie ga  of  recommended reviewed november   very happy   josh is in a class
