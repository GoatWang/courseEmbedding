rockies › carbonate diagenesis    instructors dr peter a scholle and dr dana ulmerscholle new mexico tech  scholle petrographic synopsis carbonate diagenesis includes any physical or chemical changes that occur in carbonate rocks after their deposition it can begin on the sea floor and may include early subaerial exposure syneogenetic continue through possible burial mesogenetic and into possible upliftrelated telogenetic realms since diagenesis has profound effects on the porosity and permeability evolution of the carbonate reservoirs understanding these changes can provide valuable information on both the history of reservoir potential through time as well as the history of fluid flow through the units although many reservoirs produce mainly from original or early formed pores there is a growing understanding that latestage diagenesis can also form excellent productive porosity unlike most courses that consist of only lectures this course provides participants an opportunity to have handson experience using standard petrographic techniques to better understand how diagenesis impacts carbonate reservoirs and how to identify the processes involved and their relative timing this class is designed for participants who have some fundamental knowledge of geology and some minimal petrographic experience ie can identify common minerals like quartz calcite etc under the microscope the course integrating petrography into petrophysical or core studies of carbonate rocks provides unique and important information about their diagenetic history the information garnered from petrographic analyses can be utilized to better understand reservoir trends diagenetic effects that impact reservoir quality and fluid flow through these rocks this course combines halfday lectures with handson petrographic observations of thin sections from a variety of carbonate rocks participants are also welcome to bring their own thin section samples to the class course topics overview of carbonate rocks and their composition syndepositional to early burial diagenesis marine and meteoric processes burial diagenesis upliftrelated diagenesis dolomitization the

diagenesis fracturing and production from monterey formation offshore california diagenesis of the monterey formation includes the opala opalct microcrystallinequartz transformation dolomitization and in some places the formation of brittle vitreous cherts these diagenetic transformations produce a more brittle rock diagenesis is thus considered a major control on the fracture potential of monterey rocks once formed fractures become excellent fluid migration paths fluid migration along fractures creates vuggy porosity adjacent to the fracture and may promote the generation of secondary matrix porosity primarily in carbonaterich lithologies the monterey is characterized by high matrix porosity but very low matrix permeability the vast quantities of hydrocarbons produced from this formation require production from matrix porosity in addition to production from fracture porosity a model is suggested in which matrixbound hydrocarbons migrate into fractures that intersect high porositylow permeability beds these fractures either intersect high porositylow permeability beds these fractures either intersect other fractures the borehole or stratigraphic breccias any or all of these conditions should enhance productivity this model diminishes the problems associated with fluids migrating long distances through a lowpermeability matrix implications of the model include the following  fracturing carbonaterich rocks with matrix porosity should yield the best production  chertrich lithologies with no matrix porosity will produce primarily frommore » fractures  highporosity

northwest china citation details indocument search title diagenesis and secondary porosity enhancement from dissolution of analcime cement in reservoir sandstones the upper permian pingdiquan formation junggar basin northwest china the junggar basin is one of the largest and most important oilproducing basins in china in which upper permian lacustrine oil shales are among the thickest and richest petroleum source rocks in the world the upper permian pingdiquan formation was deposited predominantly in fandelta sequences within a lacustrine setting the pingdiquan formation sandstones constitute the principal oil reservoirs whereas the interbedded black shales are the predominant oil source rocks the early diagenetic mineral assemblage in the sandstones comprises siderite pyrite analcime albite calcite and authigenic quartz as well as trace amount of halite by contrast the late diagenetic minerals are characterized by authigenic kfeldspar ankerite and minor amounts of mixedlayer clay minerals petrographic mineralogical and available paleoecological data suggest that early authigenic minerals in the sandstones were controlled by alternating periodic fresh water and salinealkaline water episodes in a lacustrine environment the cementation of siderite analcime calcite and albite occluded the substantial porosity in the sandstones at an early diagenetic stage however extensive dissolution of analcime cement and labile detrital feldspars occurred during burial diagenesis resulting in a significant secondary porosity enhancement in the sandstones and making them very good quality oil reservoirs the origin of secondary porosity is relatedmore » to the generation of various organic acids due to organic maturation of the interbedded exceptionally organicrich oil shales« less authors zhaohui t  longstaffe fj   parnell j   show author affiliations univ of western ontario london canada univ of belfast united kingdom publication date osti
