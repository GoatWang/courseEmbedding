committee maintains full responsibility for the appointment compensation and oversight of the work of the funds independent registered public accounting firm each funds audit committee has considered whether the provision by the funds independent registered public accounting firm of nonaudit services to the funds investment adviser as well as any of its affiliates that provide ongoing services to the fund that were not preapproved pursuant to rule cii of regulation sx is compatible with maintaining the independent registered public accounting firms independence in connection with deloittes annual required communication regarding all relationships between deloitte and its affiliates deloitte entities and the eaton vance family of funds and their affiliates deloitte informed the audit committee that certain  proxy statement dated january   relationships between deloitte entities and its lenders who are record owners of more than  of the shares of one or more funds  within

prohibits an accounting firm such as deloitte from having certain financial relationships with its audit clients and affiliated entities specifically the loan rule provides in relevant part that an accounting firm generally would not be independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit clients equity securities the funds are providing this disclosure to explain the facts and circumstances as well as deloittes conclusions concerning deloittes objectivity and impartiality with respect to the audits of the funds deloitte advised the audit committee of its conclusion that in light of the facts surrounding its lending relationships deloittes objectivity and impartiality in the planning and conduct of the audits of each funds financial statements will not be compromised deloitte is in a position to continue as the auditor for each fund and no actions need to be taken with respect to previously issued reports by deloitte  deloitte has advised the audit committee that these conclusions were based in part on the following considerations  deloitte entity personnel responsible for managing the lending relationships have had no interactions with the audit engagement team  the lending relationships are in good standing and the principal and interest payments are uptodate and  the lending relationships are not significant to the deloitte entities or to deloitte on june   the sec issued noaction relief to another mutual fund complex see fidelity management  research company et al noaction letter june   the noaction letter related to the auditor independence issue described above  in the noaction letter the sec indicated that it would not recommend enforcement action against the fund group if the auditor is not in compliance with the loan rule provided that  the auditor has complied with pcaob rule b and b  the auditors noncompliance under the loan rule is with respect to certain lending relationships and  notwithstanding such noncompliance the auditor has concluded that it is objective and impartial with respect to the issues encompassed within its engagement as auditor of the funds  based on information provided by deloitte the requirements of the noaction letter appear to be met with respect to deloittes lending relationships described above after giving consideration to the guidance provided in the noaction letter deloitte affirmed to the audit committee that deloitte is an independent accountant with respect to each fund within the meaning of the rules and standards of the pcaob and the securities laws and regulations administered by the sec the sec has indicated that the noaction relief will expire  months from its issuance officers of the

mar   the us municipal bond market posted positive returns for the first quarter of  with the bloomberg barclays municipal bond index the index returning  for the threemonth period after experiencing a significant amount of volatility foll owing donald trumps presidential election victory during the fourth quarter of  the municipal market stabilized during the first quarter during the period shortterm municipal yields declined  basis points while intermediate and longerter m yields were flat to slightly higher after experiencing significantly negative outflows during the last six weeks of  mutual fund flows stabilized and turned positive in january as some investors sought to take advantage of both higher municipal yields and attractive relative valuatio ns despite this expression of confidence at the beginning of the year mutual fund flows for the entire quarter were fairly tepid with overall inflows totaling just under  billion issuance during the quarter declined to  billion compared to  b illion during the fourth quarter of  the slowdown in issuance was largely related to the a decline in refunding activity due to higher interest rates and the uncertainty surrounding president trumps agenda for health care tax reform and infrastruc ture spending compared to the sharp selloff during the fourth quarter the municipal market was relatively quiet during the first quarter treasury yields traded in a fairly tight range and the curve was more or less unchanged meanwhile the municipal yield curve st eepened significantly as two and fiveyear yields declined  and  basis points respectively while year yields increased bp as a result short term municipals outperformed longerterm municipals with the fiveand sevenyear part of the curve le ading the way in terms of credit quality lower quality municipals outperformed higher quality as bbbs within the index returned  compared to aaas up  similarly after underperforming significantly during the fourth quarter the bloomberg barclays high yield municipal bond index returned  significantly outperforming investment grade this outperformance was primarily due to higher carry spread tightening and renewed strength in the tobacco sector which returned  finally puerto rico cred its underperformed significantly following the release of its certified financial plan in midmarch which proved to be more negative for all bondholders than previously anticipated performance summary  eaton vance municipal income trust the trust evn underperformed the index at net asset value for the quarter the funds security selection within zero coupon bonds and electricpower sector bonds hurt performance relative to the index for the qu arter the funds security selection within the idr pcr industrial development revenue and pollution control revenue sector bonds aided relative performance in addition the funds security selection within insured puerto rico bonds bolstered perform ance the funds use of leverage employed through tobs and auction preferred shares aided from performance relative to the index these securities act as a financing mechanism allowing investors to borrow at shortterm rates and invest

attractive on both an absolute and relative level intermediate and longerterm municipals stabilized during the quarter and the  and year municipaltotreasury ratios ended the quarter at  and  respectivel y lackluster mutual fund flows and the ongoing expectation of lower taxes under the trump administration have combined to keep municipal valuations attractive in our view in addition we continue to lack specific details related to the specifics of trump s policies what will get through congress and when as a result there are a wide range of potential outcomes in our view the historic move higher in yields during the fourth quarter of  created an emerging opportunity to lock in higher yields and potentially generate higher future returns after the first three months of  we believe this opportunity r emains in place in recent history the municipal market has proven to be resilient and sharp increases in municipal yields have resulted in buying opportunities and rewarded investors with strong returns in subsequent months therefore we continue to b elieve that municipal yields could move back down a bit in  there are other factors that could cause rates to retrace a bit especially on the longer end of the treasury curve first us treasury yields are still historically low but very attract ive when compared with other developed markets such as europe and japan second following the failure to reform the affordable care act uncertainty surrounding president trumps ability to deliver on the policy front has increased and finally after i ncreasing the fed funds rate by  basis points during the first quarter the federal reserve is forecasting two more rate hikes in  demonstrating a willingness to squeeze off inflationary pressures if necessary given this outlook we believe taxsensitive investors continue to be offered the opportunity to scale into munis at attractive yields and valuations in addition we believe municipals will continue to act as an
