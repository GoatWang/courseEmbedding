johnson administrator of the us environmental protection agency biography october  0 stephen l johnson thank you for joining me this is my first opportunity to participate in an ask the white house forum and im excited to discuss bush administrations efforts in promoting clean and dependable energy solutions today im pleased to kick off energy stars annual change a light change the world campaign consumers have a choice between installing traditional lighting or energy star qualified lights that protect our environment promote greater economic security and put more money in our pockets the change a light campaign is about getting these lights off the store shelves and into peoples homes saving money while protecting the environment is as easy as changing a light by encouraging americans to make smart energy decisions president bush and epa are brightening americas future  literally  one light at a time now id be happy to answer any questions carol from annapolis writes what is energy star stephen l johnsonthanks for the question carol  this is a great place to start energy star is a voluntary federal program run by the environmental protection agency and the department of energy that helps all of us save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices the bush administration is a big supporter of energy star because it is all about delivering economic and environmental results without sacrificing performance last year alone americans with the help of energy star saved  billion on their utility bills and prevented greenhouse gas emission equivalent to those from  million cars  the number of all the cars in california and illinois combined when most people hear the name energy star they probably think about big appliances like refrigerators air conditioners or washing machines but during the change a light campaign were focusing on an energy user thats often overlooked but lights up all the rest  home lighting for more information on a variety of energyefficient products that you can use in your home or office go to wwwenergystargov tim from denton tx writes ive heard a rumor that technology exists which can create lightbulbs that last for years is that true and if so would they be energy efficient stephen l johnsonin this case the rumors are true an energy star bulb lasts about  years versus an incandescent bulb that burns out in six months to a year plus energy star bulbs use  less power than a conventional bulb through energy star president bush and epa are brightening americas future  literally  one light at a time during the change a light change the world campaign we are educating consumers  who like me hate replacing their bulbs every few months  to make smart energy solutions for their environment and their wallets for every traditional bulb you replace with an energy star bulb youll save 0 on your energy bill over the life of the bulb and prevent the emission of 0 pounds of greenhouse gases  and minimize the number of times you have to climb up on your stepstool to replace those burnedout bulbs mark from durham nc writes there is so much backandforth in the media about the nature of global warming i know that we will see some fluctations in temperatures around the globe for a number of reasons but dont know what to think is global warming all hype all horror or somewhere inbetween thanks sir mark stephen l johnsonpresident bush understands that the world is going through a period of warming however the science is still out as to how much it is affected by human activity what we do know is that every individual has the power to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by installing energy efficient products with a smaller climate footprint the bush administration recognizes that america has a significant role to play in reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions we as a country release that is why we are implementing an aggressive yet practical strategy to reduce emissions while growing the american economy since 0 the bush administration has committed over  billion to climate change science technology and tax incentive programs  more than any other country in the world through programs like energy star we are encouraging consumers and businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions while reducing their energy costs  setting an example for the rest of the world to follow cliff from brimfield ohio writes dr johnson they have dancing with the stars and singing with the stars and now we have energy stars and the program with a savings of energy for 0 million homes and greenhouse gases of  million cars i would say this is a program that is giving a lot of bang for the buck and i hope we keep shooting for the stars is this a long term program with white house support thank you stephen l johnsonmy wife says i have two left feet and an american idol i am not but i do know a thing or two about saving energy and saving money through energy star president bush and epa are brightening americas environmental economic and energy future one light at a time today im encouraging all americans to join me in taking the change a light pledge at wwwenergystargov and commit to changing just one traditional light in their home to one thats earned epas energy star label if every american household changed just one bulb we would save enough power to light more than  million homes  thats all the homes in washington dc and the state of maryland combined and by changing just one bulb homeowners can save more than 0 dollars in electricity costs over the bulbs lifetime and prevent more than 0 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions as epa administrator and a consumer i practice what i preach over the years i have designed and served as the general contractor for several of my familys homes in every one i considered their efficient use of water and energy our current home has won an award for energy efficiency  saving my family hundreds of dollars a year on power costs and limiting its impact on the environment chris from sylacaugaalabama writes are you the person that can answer my questions was the president impressed with the e gasoline that hoover police department is using in alabama is this something the president is thinking about using nation wide for our vehicles stephen l johnsonthe president and i applaud any effort to help break americas dependency on foreign sources of energy the president knows our nation is too reliant on foreign energy and the best way to get off this treadmill of dependency is through innovative fuel technology like e president bush set a clear goal in his state of the union address last january when he announced a new national investment in energy innovation to accelerate our nations drive towards energy independence his advanced energy initiative includes a national goal of replacing more than  of our oil imports by the year  president bush and epa are encouraging the advances in energy innovation that power our nations economy and drive our environmental successes since 0 under president bushs leadership our nation has funded nearly 0 billion in developing energy sources that are cleaner cheaper and more reliable epa is building on this progress and will soon announce a program to promote the use of e biodiesel and the vehicles that use them so for now the hoover police department may have a jump on other parts of the country  but epa is working to ensure all americans have access to alternative fuels and are helping us build toward a clean secure energy future david from portland oregon writes i am concerned with the way gas prices have gone and am wondering if this administration has been finding new ways to fuel our vehicles other than with oil i personally like the idea of hydrogen because water is what is left after it is burned are we finding any feasible less expensive ways of fueling our nations vehicles stephen l johnsonthanks david as epa administrator i also envision a future where water is the only emission from our cars although fleets like some postal service trucks here in washington dc are using hydrogen fuel cells to power their vehicles the technology is still costprohibitive for most uses the bush administration is exploring ways to utilize two important alternative fuels  ethanol and biodiesel  renewable fuels that decrease emissions and also decrease our dependency on foreign oil both of these fuels are made from plants  currently ethanol begins life as corn stalks and biodiesel comes from soybeans epa is working to increase the supply availability and competitiveness of these clean fuels as well as the cars and trucks that use them epa and our partners are moving fuel technology breakthroughs from the labs to the streets this summer epa unveiled the most fuelefficient and costeffective delivery vehicle in the world utilizing hybrid hydraulic technology we partnered with ups to develop a truck with 00 better fuel efficiency and 0 lower greenhouse gas emissions as compared to a conventional diesel delivery truck laboratory tests show that this hybrid technology has the potential to save more than  gallons of fuel each year and over 0 in fuel costs over its lifetime imagine the enormous fuel savings for an entire fleet of trucks sandy from ohio writes i am extremely pleased with the all electric geothermal heatingair conditioning system we had installed  years ago everyone told us at the time all electric was too expensive during the  month heating season we are charged significantly less by our electric company per kwhour than homes that are not all electric i am the thermostat watcher in our house to better control your monthly bill youll need to close curtains on windows that let the hot sun shine through youll need to add sweatshirts and or sweatpants during cold weather but were for the most part comfortable ive found it more efficient and more dependable than the heat pump we had our hot water is also optionally geothermally heatedi dont want to mislead anyone it is significantly much more expensive than traditional heatingcooling systems to have installed i believe a 0 tax credit for system and install would generate a lot of interest 0 credit would generate even more and would at the same time make the system more affordable for anyone interested just google geothermal as there is much information available my question why arent you more actively promoting and advertising this type of system i would gladly be your spokesperson o this should be plastered all over the media stephen l johnsonwhats very exciting to see is a range of new and existing technologies to heat and cool our homes the energy star label can be found on the most efficient of these technologies in my own home i have dualstage heat pumps that are very efficient and effective in heating and cooling my home the reason why we are here today is because president bush wants us to promote investments in science and technology that will secure our nations environmental and energy successes geothermal and other energy efficient systems are great examples of technologies that are available today and offer consumers energy efficient solutions jenifer from china writes what have the us goverment done to improve the publics sense of enviroment protection thank you for you service stephen l johnsonus environmental protection agency is celebrating its th anniversary this year our air pollution has been reduced by 0 our water is significantly cleaner today than  years ago and we have cleaned up literally thousands of hazardous waste sites around the united states we have accomplished all of this at the same time as our population has grown 0 and our gdp has grown almost three times so the experience in the united states is that environmental protection and economic growth go handinhand ps i enjoyed my recent visit to china and am actively cooperating with my colleagues there jason from minnesota writes why dont they start making other things more energy efficient like boats lawnmowers and other things we use dailey and use up alot of gas thye boat we use goes through about a tank every 0 hours and that would be  gallons the yachts in florida and on the mississippi river go through event mare then that if we make this more efficient we will cut back the use of gas jason th grade stephen l johnsoni agree and the bush administration is encouraging the development of more fuel efficient engines for boats lawn mowers cars and trucks you might be interested to know that at epa we have a fuel cell car that we are testing it runs on hydrogen and the
