team brought velocity through a process that worked in a highly regulated environment for a wholesale bank services agile coaching product strategy interaction design frontend development rails development content strategy client federal home loan bank of san francisco what we did we worked with the federal home loan bank of san francisco to rebuild their online transaction service and reports via a new member portal the bank provides reliable liquidity to its member institutions to support housing finance community investment and economic developmentthe project involved elements of product strategy design development and content strategy we fine tuned applied and extended the new visual design created by another agency we added streamlined transaction flows new data visualizations report data display and navigation to help member users be more efficient on the development side we used modern tools like ruby on rails and chef implemented continuous delivery with jenkins and supported the banks migration to the cloud   how we did it high level organization it all started with a  week assessment of the bank’s development organizational structure including people processes and technology we recommended changes regarding the bank’s  office space use of agile tools and a strategy for migrating to cloud computing the bank reviewed our recommendations and asked us to implement nearly all of them applying design to meet requirements another agency did the initial user research and the visual design for the bank’s member portal our product and design team extended those goals and standards to the bank’s product and business requirements to meet member needs prioritization we took many “bluesky” concepts and strengthened them by determining what was feasible from a budget and development perspective and worked with the bank to prioritize the delivery of features by facilitating valueeffort trade exercises leading companywide change the member portal project was set up as a pilot to introduce process and tool changes and exceeded expectations by becoming the model for early adoption of new technologies processes and behaviors that other bank teams could incorporate into other projects what we learned we succeeded in making a huge impact for the bank from a tools and process perspective and even in delivering value to the  pilot member banks using the new member portal the pilot users are delighted with the new features we built for them we implemented feature flipping to enable frequent releases to production and to allow specific testers to test features safely in production this technique added some overhead to our process but allowed us to keep a twoweek cadence to our production deployments using design specifications provided by another agency we found the balance between effective and practical design and user and development requirements ultimately providing bank customers with a more streamlined and efficient online experience   this project really highlighted the importance of quality unit test and integration suites the preproduction environments are significantly different from production due to the nature of financial data so having a very robust test suite and the ability to simulate realtime market services proved to be invaluable lab zero takes highcomplexityhighcompliance products seriously and can deliver well as a team with product design and development we were able to redesign the member portal functionality which transacts millions to billions of dollars per day in an agile way we introduced the latest tools and techniques to support userfocused requirements specification and continuous delivery come see us  battery st suite  san francisco ca  call us p  f  or

c williams speeches assessing the new normals presentation to the federal home loan bank of san francisco’s  member conference san francisco california by john c williams president and ceo federal reserve bank of san francisco for delivery on october  download pdf version  kbgood morning i represent the th federal reserve district and that covers a lot of territory—in fact over a third of the country an important part of my job is to travel across the western united states meeting with people and getting grassroots information about how the economy is doing but i’ll admit that once in a while it’s nice to give a speech closer to home and be able to sleep in my own bed tonight that is to say it’s a pleasure to be here today i’m going to talk about where i see the us economy going and what that means for monetary policy in addition to the usual reading of the tea leaves about the nearterm economic outlook i will take a longerterm perspective and focus on how the new normal for the us economy is shaping up before i proceed i should note that the views i express here are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the federal reserve system the dual mandate as a fed policymaker i tend to see virtually everything through the lens of our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability and i’ll describe economic developments through that lens i’ll begin with employment our goal is not to have an unemployment rate of zero instead it’s to be near what economists call the “natural rate” of unemployment that’s the rate we can expect to see in a healthy “goldilocks” economy—one that’s running neither too hot nor too cold it’s impossible to know exactly what that magic number is but it’s generally thought to be between ¾ and  percent today by the way that’s about the same number that economists thought before the recession so this is one case where the new normal is the same as the old as i’ll note later in my remarks this is more the exception than the norm with the unemployment rate at  percent we’re very close to that goal of course the unemployment rate isn’t the only measure of labor market health and it’s reassuring that a range of indicators have been improving and are sending similar signals in particular one labor market indicator that i look to measures what regular people—by that i mean not just economists—say when they are asked how hard it is to find a job those responses are currently right in line with or in fact even a little better than the signal we’re getting from the unemployment rate that’s great news about the job market and it means that we won’t need as much job growth going forward as we’ve seen in the past few years because we’re pretty much at full employment now the future is less about creating an ever stronger labor market than about maintaining a healthy one which means creating enough new jobs to keep up with the increase in the size of the labor force that number depends on things like the number of people retiring this year or graduating from school and entering the workforce these factors can change a lot over time during the s and s the growing youth population and rapid labor force entry by women pushed up labor force growth and the rate of job growth needed to keep up it reached a peak of about  jobs per month in  and stayed close to that level through the s since then with labor force growth slowing due to an aging population stabilization in women’s participation and other factors required job growth slowed substantially i put it at around  a month currently looking ahead estimates that take account of potential labor force trends imply a range from  to a little over  so this year’s pace of job gains of about  jobs a month is more than twice as fast as we need to keep up with the trend in labor force growth and quite honestly is unsustainable in the long run with job gains continuing to far outpace labor force growth i expect the unemployment rate to edge down over the next year bottoming out somewhere between ½ and ¾ percent—a very strong labor market by any standard under these conditions we should expect the pace of job gains to slow and no one should be alarmed when it does—we should only be alarmed frankly if we don’t see that necessary slowdown this slowdown in labor force growth also has important implications for the new normal for economic growth in the long run two factors determine the speed at which the economy can grow in a balanced manner the size of the labor force and labor productivity the congressional budget office projects that the labor force in the us will grow at about ½ percent per year over the next decade as i mentioned the transition of women to the labor force is long complete and the baby boomers are already retiring this is a considerable drop from the pace experienced over the past  years this means that unlike in the s and ’s demographics will hinder rather than boost potential output growth we have also seen a significant slowdown in productivity growth over the past  years totaleconomy productivity growth or gdp per hour has typically averaged between  and ¼ percent per year since the s we’ve only deviated from this pace during the information technology boom of the late s and early s therefore a reasonable benchmark is that totaleconomy productivity growth in the range of  to ¼ percent represents normal incremental growth this view is consistent with research by leading experts moreover since educational attainment per worker is unlikely to rise the way it did during much of the th century the future pace of productivity growth will likely be at the lower end of the historical range that is not much above  percent putting these two ingredients together demographics and productivity in my view the trend growth rate of the us economy is between ½ and ¾ percent per year this is admittedly a far cry from the  percent rates ingrained in our memories from the s and s demographic and productivity trends are difficult to bend in many ways the die has already been cast of course there may be a revolutionary invention or technology just around the corner our crystal ball is hazy about when the next technological revolution will arrive in the meantime it’s more likely than not that slow growth is both real and here to stay and while the days of  percent growth are behind us at least for the foreseeable future it isn’t the end of the world we can still run a strong economy gdp increased about  percent last year yet we added ¾ million jobs and  looks to be a lot like  with continued moderate gdp growth and solid job gains turning to our second mandate of price stability the fed’s monetary policy committee—the federal open market committee or fomc for short—has set a longrun goal of  percent inflation inflation has been running persistently below that goal for several years over the past couple of years the strengthening of the dollar and declines in energy prices have pushed inflation down but these influences should fade over time to cut through some of the noise it’s useful to look at measures of inflation that strip out volatile prices and provide a clearer view of the underlying trend these suggest that underlying inflation is running about ¾ percent so we’re not quite at our target yet but we’re getting pretty darn close the combination of fading transitory factors and a strong economy should help us get back to our  percent goal in the next year or two to sum up the economic expansion remains on the right track the labor market is strong the economy has good forward momentum and inflation is moving towards our  percent goal  what it means for interest rates so what does this mean for interest rates in the context of a strong economy with good momentum it makes sense to get back to a pace of gradual rate increases preferably sooner rather than later let me be clear in arguing for a gradual increase in interest rates i’m not trying to stall the economic expansion it’s just the opposite my aim is to keep it on a sound footing so that it can be sustained for a long time history teaches us that an economy that runs too hot for too long can generate imbalances potentially leading to excessive inflation asset market bubbles and ultimately economic correction and recession a gradual process of raising rates reduces the risks of such an outcome it also allows a smoother more calibrated process of normalization that gives us space to adjust our responses to any surprise changes in economic conditions if we wait too long to remove monetary accommodation we hazard allowing imbalances to grow requiring us to play catchup and not leaving much room to maneuver not to mention a sudden reversal of policy could be disruptive and slow the economy in unintended ways as i said my goal is to sustain the strong economy for as long as possible the best way to accomplish this is by supporting a moderate pace of growth that is consistent with the new normal pace of gdp and jobs growth and that will keep the unemployment rate near the natural rate i fear that if we allow the economy to overshoot this mark by too much eventually we will need to reverse course to bring the economy back on track the experience of past business cycles shows that this is a hard if not impossible act to pull off and ultimately ends in recession a gradual process of removing monetary accommodation reduces this risk    how low can rates stay so far i have talked a lot about the new normal for the labor market and economic growth what about interest rates like job growth and gdp growth the new normal for interest rates is likely much lower than we are used to there is growing evidence of a significant decline in the natural rate of interest or r rstar over the past quartercentury to historically low levels the natural interest rate is the shortterm real inflationadjusted interest rate that balances monetary policy so that it is neither accommodative nor contractionary in terms of growth and inflation while a central bank sets its shortterm interest rate rstar is a function of factors beyond its influence a variety of economic factors have pushed natural interest rates very low and they appear poised to stay that way this is the case not just for the united states but for other economies as well in a recent paper kathryn holston thomas laubach and i estimated the inflationadjusted natural rate for four major economies the united states canada the euro area and the united kingdom in  estimates ranged from about ½ to ½ percent by  on the eve of the global financial crisis these had all declined to between  and ½ percent since then all four estimates have dropped sharply to slightly below ½ percent for canada and the united kingdom about ½ percent for the united states and well below zero for the euro area the underlying determinants for these declines are related to the global supply and demand for funds including shifting demographics slower trend productivity and economic growth emerging markets seeking large reserves of safe assets and a more general global savings glut the key takeaway from these global trends is that interest rates are going to stay lower than we’ve come to expect in the past this does not mean they will be zero but when juxtaposed with prerecession normal shortterm interest rates of say  to ½ percent it may be jarring to see the underlying rstar guiding us towards a new normal of  to ½ percent—or even lower importantly this future of low interest rates is not due to easy monetary policy instead it is the rate expected to prevail when the economy is at full strength and the stance of monetary policy is neutral conclusion although it has been a long hard road back from the recession the american economy is in good shape and headed in the right direction we’re essentially at full employment and inflation is well within sight of and on track to reach our target given the progress we have made and signs of continued solid momentum in the economy and consistent with our agreedupon monetary policy approach it makes sense for the fed to gradually move interest rates toward more normal levels this policy path should be viewed in the context of an economy that has mostly cleared the great recession but faces a future that looks very different from the past in important ways although the natural rate of unemployment appears close to what it was a decade ago demographic trends and a sustained productivity slowdown have pushed down the normal growth rates of jobs and gdp and have lowered the normal rates of interest these developments will shape the economic landscape for years to
