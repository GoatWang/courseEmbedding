citation stanford j and j wilson  stalking snakes days and nights in the life of a brown treesnake rapid responder it has been more than  years since dr julie savidge now of colorado state university and other biologists first took notice of the invasive brown treesnake on guam and its impacts on the island’s native bird life today we are well aware of at least three major impacts of the snake’s invasion legacy on guam first this nocturnal treedwelling snake has caused the extirpation of nearly every species of forest bird and has played a major role in reducing or eliminating several species of native lizards and at least one mammalian species second brown treesnake bites are mildly venomous and often require medical attention especially bites to infants and small children third the snake causes frequent power outages when climbing along utility lines or coming into contact with exposed structure wiring the annual cost associated with snakeinduced power outages on guam was recently estimated to be  million on a populous island with many atrisk ecosystems such as oahu hawaii an established population of brown treesnakes would be even more ecologically and economically damaging with costs possibly exceeding  million per year related projects title completion year investigator fort communications and outreach  katie walters control and containment of the brown treesnake and
