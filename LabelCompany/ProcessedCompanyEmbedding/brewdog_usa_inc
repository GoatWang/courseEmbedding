section history usa history contact us equity for punks work for brewdog choose year             employees   dog hl beer brewed  shareholders  bars martin and i james were bored of the industrially brewed lagers and stuffy ales that dominated the uk beer market we decided the best way to fix this undesirable predicament was to brew our own consequently in april  brewdog was born both only  at the time we leased a building in fraserburgh got some scary bank loans spent all our money on stainless steel and started making some hardcore craft beers we brewed tiny batches filled bottles by hand and sold our beers at local markets and out of the back of our beat up old van our biggest mission when we set up brewdog was to make other people as passionate about great craft beer as we are and that is still our biggest mission today   employees   dog hl beer brewed  shareholders  bars things started getting crazy for us in  they have stayed crazy or perhaps got even crazier ever since we somehow persuaded the banks to give us money to buy loads more tanks and a proper bottling machine we masterminded the uks strongest ever beer tokyo this resulted in a huge media storm and if you believed the headlines the downfall of western civilisation the portman group pretty much banned all of our beers but we started exporting to sweden japan and america we also got to go on tv with oz clark and in only the nd year of brewdog we became scotland’s largest independent brewery   employees   dog hl beer brewed  shareholders  bars by this point brewdog had become the uk’s fastestgrowing alternative beer brand and the punk ipa became the topselling ipa in scandinavia to keep up with the sheer demand for our beers we needed more huge tanks but had no room inside our fraserburgh brewery to put them so when they arrived outside they went we also launched equity for punks in a groundbreaking first we offered people the opportunity to buy shares in our company online over  invested and our antibusiness business model was born we continued to push boundaries and smash peoples perceptions of what beer can be by brewing the worlds strongest ever beer tactical nuclear penguin at  we also aged a beer on the deck of a fishing boat smashed loads of industrial beers with a golf club and grew our business by  in the worst recession for generations   employees   dog hl beer brewed  shareholders  bar  was a veritable roller coaster for us as we continued our mission to spread the craft beer gospel opening our first craft beer bar in our home town of aberdeen was a dream come true and we were blown away by the response from customers we picked up the gold medal for hardcore ipa at the world beer cup and james became scotlands youngest ever entrepreneur of the year we brewed a  abv beer and packed it in roadkill making it the worlds most expensive beer ever as we fused the seldomcolliding worlds of art craft beer and taxidermy we managed to find space for even more fermentation tanks in our increasingly cramped brewery and we also held our first ever agm for our equity punk shareholders in a very snowy aberdeen in december   employees   dog hl beer brewed  shareholders  bars due to the runaway success of brewdog aberdeen we were able to open bars in edinburgh glasgow and a flagship london venue in camden in true brewdog style we announced our arrival in the capital by driving down camden high street in a brewdog tank we also brewed a beer at the bottom of the ocean seriously dispensed a  beer from a modified deers head and grew our business over  again as we started building our new ecobrewery with demand for our beers reaching scary new levels most significantly we also launched equity for punks ii raising over £m to help us continue to grow and welcoming over  new shareholders martin also dressed up as the queen for our year end video blog   employees   dog hl beer brewed  shareholders  bars  was one hell of a year for brewdog we moved from our cobbledtogether brewery in fraserburgh to a state of the art ecobrewery in ellon what started out as a dream five years earlier had become our new reality the worldclass hq enabled us to tighten every aspect of production whilst making even more amazing craft beer than ever before we were able to grow revenues by  and were awarded the fastest growing company in scotland and also listed in the sunday times fast track  as the fastest growing food and drink company in the uk six new brewdog bars opened across the uk with a new london flagship in shoreditch as diageo infamously cheated us from an award for our bars which resulted in another global media storm we also projected ourselves naked onto the houses of parliament made a special beer for the olympics launched the phenomenal dead pony club and hosted  equity punks in aberdeen for our rock ‘n roll agm   employees   dog hl beer brewed  shareholders  bars  was pretty epic we raised £m through equity for punks iii smashing crowdfunding records along the way welcoming almost  new investors from  different countries we recorded the first season of our own brewdogs tv show in the us brewing amazing beers with some of america’s best craft brewers we opened our first ever international bar in stockholm holding a funeral for generic beer in the centre of the swedish capital we were also flattered and bemused in equal measure when a fake brewdog bar opened in china in beer terms we launched the insanely popular jack hammer doubled the size of our brand new brewery and held mandatory company yoga sessions for all our team in the carpark one of these is a lie   employees   dog hl beer brewed  shareholders  bars  was a whirlwind as we continued our mission to make other people as passionate about great beer as we are by adding more beers more bars more customers and more team members to our business our assault on humanity continued with the opening of  new brewdog bars as far afield as brazil and japan as well as our first bottledog and the awesome dogtap at brewdog hq we also updated our branding and hit the headlines for sticking it to the portman group as well as russian premier vladimir putin we released  different brewdog beers unleashed truck norris on the world hit the screens with a second season of brewdogs and shipped our beers to  different countries we did not sleep much   employees   dog hl beer brewed  shareholders  bars in  we launched the largest equity crowdfunding scheme in human history – equity for punks iv – breaking world records in the process we opened  new bars including an epic new location in our home city of aberdeen as well as the triple threat of awesome beer food and bottledog in the form of doghouse in glasgow we also launched our first shuffledog

made the process as easy for you to follow as we are allowed to by law will the stock be listed on an exchange like nasdaq eventually that is our goal  but for now our shares are not publicly traded

 months old sean farrell thursday  august   edt last modified on friday  july   edt brewdog the selfstyled “punk” brewer is seeking to raise up to m £m from american ale enthusiasts to expand in the us despite only having a niche following in the world’s biggest craft beer market and no sales there for the past year the scottish company has launched its biggest crowdfunding campaign by asking us consumers to buy at least two shares for  each of a new us company that will be valued at m the “equity for punks usa” fundraising will sell up to a fifth of brewdog usa inc with the remainder owned by brewdog and its existing  crowdfunded investors brewdog has almost finished building a  sq metre  sq ft brewery in columbus ohio scheduled to open this year the company will use the money to finance production at the site and to open bars depending on the amount raised the aggressive outrageous infuriating and ingenious rise of brewdog read more as in the uk investors will get a range of perks including  off drinks in brewdog bars around the world a free tour of the columbus brewery and two tickets to the us company’s beerfuelled annual meeting brewdog has funded its rapid expansion in britain and construction of the columbus site by raising a total of £m from small investors many of whom were fans of its beer in the past seven years it is now seeking to raise substantially more than that in just six months from us beer fans brewdog’s founder james watt said he thought the share offer would be a success because of the enthusiasm for craft beer in the us and the attraction of owning a stake in a brewery brewdog has also raised its profile with a tv show about beer on the us esquire network presented by watt and his cofounder martin dickie he said brewdog has sold beer in the us since  through chains such as whole foods but watt said transporting the beer from scotland made it more expensive and less fresh than it should be brewdog halted us sales a year ago to differentiate the older pricier beer from the product that will be brewed in columbus watt said “we’ve got a decent but small customer base but the logistics made it unfeasible to scale up our ambitions in the us without making beer there “hey it’s a gamble will we be able to pull this off who knows but it’s a great opportunity for people to make an investment in the business and as we’ve shown in the uk people make a fairly good return on their investment” the us is the fastestgrowing craft beer market in the world with sales of bn according to brewdog while total us beer consumption shrinks craft beer is forecast to grow from  of the market to  by  watt said m was the maximum brewdog hoped to raise but only m was needed to kickstart beer production in columbus “it’s not m or go back to scotland it’s on a sliding scale” he said brewdog chose columbus in the midwest for its us base because craft beer is popular there but the market has plenty of room to grow unlike on the east

cofounder and ceo james watt wrote he said the investment in establishing the brewhouse and opening brewdog brewpubs across the country will be  million and funding raised through the program will go toward those projects i asked brewdog how and if that investment overlaps with the planned  million brewery in canal winchester but have not yet heard back some details are still to come — equity for punks usa will launch in may but the exact date has yet to be announced pricing hasn’t been announced either “our us lawyers and advisors are very confident in the proposed pricing for the us business supported by recent deals such as the  billion acquisition of ballast point the capacity we have built in columbus and our brand reputation and lockedin distribution structure” watt wrote the company

print share facebook twitter tumblr linkedin stumbleupon reddit digg mixx delicious google reprints follow time thanks to a war among european brewing companies its never been easier to catch a healthy beer buzz or get yourself totally sloshed in november brewdog a threeyearold scottish microbrewery released a new brand dubbed tactical nuclear penguin the beer set a new record by weighing in at a scary  alcohol by volume abv more than six times the strength of familiar domestic brands like budweiser as explained in a cheeky video on the companys website warning the clip contains simulated penguin sex the brewery was able to attain the high alcohol content by freezing the beer at a local ice cream factory at temperatures as low as °c °f for  days alcohol freezes at lower temperatures than water and removing water from the solution increased the alcohol concentration jim watt one of brewdogs cofounders says that some  bottles of tactical nuclear penguin are in the process of being shipped to a few stores in california and new york city including a whole foods location about half of the consumers buying beer from the brewdog website are from the us watts eyes are clearly fixed on the american market were keen to push the envelope he says and challenge peoples perceptions of how beer can be enjoyed see time video taste test beer with extra buzz a warning label on the tactical nuclear penguin bottle does state this is an extremely strong beer it should be enjoyed in small servings and with an air of aristocratic nonchalance it is exactly the same manner you would enjoy a fine whisky a frank zappa album or a visit from a friendly yet anxious ghost some alcoholwatchdog groups arent laughing the chief executive of alcohol focus scotland jack law has blasted brewdogs highalcohol products as irresponsible especially at a time when scotland is experiencing severe alcoholrelated problems in december brewdog received a slap on the wrist from a british alcohol regulatory body the portman group which ordered that retailers pull the companys  tokyo beer brand off shelves because of its marketing tactics a note on the tokyo label says it is all about moderation everything in moderation including moderation itself what logically follows is that you must from time have excess this beer is for those times after the beer was pulled brewdog came out with a  abv brew meant to tame the critics its name nanny state see how americans are spending now the drinking games continued in february when a german brewer schorschbrau released a  abv beer called schorschbock the brewdog boys fired back a few weeks later with highoctane concoction sink the bismarck which checks in at  enough to reclaim the worlds strongest beer mantle the name is a notsosubtle reference to the famous german battleship deployed during world war ii for now sink the bismarck is only available for purchase on brewdogs website and the  or so bottles that brewdog has produced are already sold out watt promises that more are on the way because of the painstaking process involved with producing such a strong drink an oz bottle of sink the bismarck costs some  minus shipping tactical nuclear penguin costs about  a bottle and can also be ordered online see reviews of  american wines even if these brands end up being carried by more bars and retailers watt firmly believes that the high prices will prohibit unsophisticated drinkers read high school kids at a kegger or college students on spring break from just picking up the stuff and chugging it but you cant deny that if the beer becomes more widely available in stores or if other brewers mimic brewdogs strategy it could become hazardous since most drinkers dont check the alcohol level on the label like they would the expiration date on a milk carton an unsuspecting soul with money to spare could sip a little too much strong stuff were all for responsible consumption watt says but as we all know beer and responsibility often dont mix so enjoy the beer wars at your own risk see pictures of boston beer company founder jim koch see the best pictures of  microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt
