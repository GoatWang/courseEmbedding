inefficient data collection methods they were using the three decided to create a product that would enable their task to be done more easily in  working in the garage at truchards home the three founded a new company they attempted to incorporate under several names including longhorn instruments and texas digital but all were rejected finally they settled on the current name of national instruments with a  loan from interfirst bank the group bought a pdp minicomputer and for their first project designed and built a gpib interface for it their first sale was the result of a cold call to kelly air force base in san antonio texas because the trio were still employed by the university of texas in  they hired their first fulltime employee kim harrisonhosen who handled orders billing and customer inquiries by the end of the year they had sold three boards and to attract more business the company produced and sent a mailer to  users of the pdp minicomputer as sales increased they were able to move into a real office space in  occupying a squarefoot  m office at  burnet road in austin texas sedit at the end of the s the company booked  in orders recording a  profit in  truchard kodosky and nowlin quit their jobs to devote themselves fulltime to national instruments and at the end of the year moved the company to a larger office renting  square feet  m of office space to

the  million sales mark leading them to move to a squarefoot  m office in  in  national instruments reached an organizational milestone developing their first gpib board to connect instruments to ibm pcs with the arrival of the macintosh computer however the company felt ready to take advantage of the new graphical interfaces kodosky began a research initiative with the assistance of student researchers at the university of texas into ways to exploit the new interface this led to the creation of nis flagship product the labview graphical development platform for the macintosh computer which was released in  the software allows engineers and scientists to program graphically by wiring icons together instead of typing textbased code by allowing people to use a more intuitive lessstructured development environment their productivity greatly increased making labview quite popular the following year a version of labview known as labwindows was released for the dos

and machine vision in  the company sold products to more than  companies with revenues of  billion usd contents  history  founding  s  s  s  products  groups  electronics workbench group  community  see also  references  external links historyedit foundingedit in the early s james truchard jeff kodosky and bill nowlin were working at the university of texas at austin applied research laboratories as part of a project conducting research for the us navy the men were using early computer technology to collect and analyze data frustrated with the inefficient data collection methods they were using the three decided to create a product that would enable their task to be done more easily in  working in the garage at truchards home the three founded a new company they attempted to incorporate under several names including longhorn instruments and texas digital but all were rejected finally they settled on the current name of national instruments with a  loan from interfirst bank the group bought a pdp minicomputer and for their first project designed and built a gpib interface for it their first sale was the result of a cold call to kelly air force base in san antonio texas because the trio were still employed by the university of texas in  they hired their first fulltime employee kim harrisonhosen who handled orders billing and customer inquiries by the end of the year they had sold three boards and to attract more business the company produced and sent a mailer to  users of the pdp minicomputer as sales increased they were able to move into a real office space in  occupying a squarefoot  m office at  burnet road in austin texas sedit at the end of the s the company booked  in orders recording a  profit in  truchard kodosky and nowlin quit their jobs to devote themselves fulltime to national instruments and at the end of the year moved the company to a larger office renting  square feet  m of office space to assist in generating revenue the company undertook numerous special projects working on a fuelpump creditcard system and a waveform generator for us navy sonar acoustic testing by  the company reached the  million sales mark leading them to move to a squarefoot  m office in  in  national instruments reached an organizational milestone developing their first gpib board to connect instruments to ibm pcs with the arrival of the macintosh computer however the company felt ready to take advantage of the new graphical interfaces kodosky began a research initiative with the assistance of student researchers at the university of texas into ways to exploit the new interface this led to the creation of nis flagship product the labview graphical development platform for the macintosh computer which was released in  the software allows engineers and scientists to program graphically by wiring icons together instead of typing textbased code by allowing people to use a more intuitive lessstructured development environment their productivity greatly increased making labview quite popular the following year a version of labview known as labwindows was released for the dos environment the company had  employees by  as part of the companys decision to begin direct sales of its products ni opened its first international branch in tokyo japan in  sedit after growing their staff enough to take over almost the entire building they were renting in  ni moved to a new building at  bridge point parkway which the company purchased in  the building located along lake austin near the loop  bridge became known as silicon hills  bridge point ni received their first patent for labview in  later that year they introduced signal conditioning extensions for instrumentation scxi to expand the signalprocessing capabilities of the pc and in  labview was first released for windowsbased pcs and unix workstations to further assist their customers ni also created the national instruments alliance partner program attracting a worldwide selection of thirdparty developers systems integrators and consultants who could extend the capabilities of the ni hardware and software with labview now available to a much larger audience in  the company reached the milestone of  million in annual sales to attract cc programmers later that year ni introduced labwindowscvi the following year an industrious employee began experiments with the relatively new world wide web and developed natinstcom the companys very first web page as the company continued to grow they began to run out of room in their approximately squarefoot  m campus in  ni broke ground on a new campus located at a acre  m site along north mopac boulevard in northern austin by this time ni had reached  employees the new ni campus which opened in  was designed to be employeefriendly it contains dedicated play areas including basketball and volleyball courts an employee gym and a campuswide walking trail each of the buildings on the campus are lined with windows and feature an open floor plan so that the employees seated in cubicles throughout the building are never far from the sun and views of northwest austin to maintain the focus on equality among the employees even dr t as the employees call their ceo sits in an open cubicle and does not have an assigned parking space employees had been granted stock in the privately held company as part of their compensation packages when the company chose to go public in  over  current and former employees owned stock the company is now listed on the nasdaq exchange as nati by the late s customers had begun using labview in industrial automation applications with labview and the more advanced daq boards provided by the company engineers could now replace expensive fixedfunction vendordefined instruments with a custom pcbased system that would acquire analyze and present data with added flexibility and a lower cost with the companys acquisition of georgetown systems lookout software ni products were further incorporated into applications run on the factoryfloor by  the company had reached  million in annual sales and was named to forbes magazines  best small companies list over the next several years the engineers at ni continued to stretch the boundaries of virtual instrumentation releasing machine vision software and hardware which allow cameras to act as sensors and motion control hardware and software ni also introduced the compactpcibased pxi an open industry standard for modular measurement and automation and ni teststand which provides for tracking highvolume manufacturing tests sedit user traffic and ecommerce rapidly improved after the company acquired the nicom domain and began investing in web technologies to better highlight their products the company quickly introduced online configuration tools to help customers decide which ni products would best interact to solve their problem and introduced ni developer zone which provides the enduser developers access to example programs sample code and development tips as well as forums in which users and ni employees could help answer questions about the products in the s ni began exporting most of its manufacturing overseas by first opening its first international manufacturing plant in debrecen hungary this squarefoot  m plant helped to diversify the companys manufacturing capabilities which had been centered at company headquarters in austin ni now manufactures nearly  of its production in debrecen and has expanded several times in the last decade in  with a multimilliondollar grant from the government ni increased production in debrecen by approximately  with stateoftheart automation processes headcount increased by only  in  the company dedicated the squarefoot  m building c on their mopac campus which became the headquarters for the companys rd operations upon completion of this building the ni campus finally had enough capacity to move all austinbased employees to a single location following the company model of selling directly to customers by  ni had opened  sales offices in europe and  offices in the asiapacific region as well as a multitude of

responsible for creating the electronic circuit design software ni multisim and ni ultiboard which was previously a canadabased company that first produced multisim and integrated ultiboard with it interactive image technologies was founded in  in toronto ontario canada by joe koenig and specialized in producing educational movies and documentaries when the government of ontario needed an educational tool for teaching electronics in colleges the company created a circuit simulator called electronics workbench in  the company started a strategic partnership with another electronic design automation company named ultimate technology from naarden netherlands who was the european market leader in printed circuit board design software with their package ultiboard like electronics workbench founder james post had focused heavily on the educational market and gained pr fame when he organized the distribution of  demo floppy disks via electronics magazines in europe in  the companies merged and renamed itself after its most well known product electronics workbench the then current product line consisted of schematic capture and a simulation product named multisim and the printed circuit board software called ultiboard soon thereafter the combined product suite became worldwide leader in pc based computeraided design in  the company was acquired by national instruments
