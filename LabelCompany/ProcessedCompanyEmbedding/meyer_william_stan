distribution william stanley  was an inventor and engineer he developed the first practical transformer which spurred the development of ac power as well as other developments like an improved electric meter and the first metal thermos bottle vacuum flask he lived most of his life and ran his businesses in western massachusetts during the golden age of electric development stanley is one of the most important inventors of ac power his work puts him on a par with edison westinghouse tesla elihu thomson charles brush and other major personalities of the time like the other great pioneers of the time he loved to tinker and design held a disdain for legal quagmires of patent proceedings and had his own set of friends and rivals in the industry stanley made transformers practical in the way that edison made the light bulb practical  tom blalock historian  life and contributions born in brooklyn new york william stanley attended private schools before enrolling at yale university he began to study law at age  but less than a semester later left school to look for a job in the emerging field of electricity the decision marked the beginning of a productive career whose highlights included the invention of the modern type of transformer and the creation of the business enterprise that was to become general electrics pittsfield works stanleys first job was as an electrician with one of the early manufacturers of telegraph keys and fire alarms he then worked in a metalplating establishment before joining hiram maxim inventor of the machine gun and already a pioneer in the electrical industry as maxims assistant stanley directed one of the countrys first electrical installations in a store on new yorks fifth avenue   stanley was inspired by charles f brushs work on batteries which involved study of electromotive force stanley developed ac power circuit designs in his notebooks but didnt yet have a chance to build prototypes this laid the foundation for his understanding of electromagnetics  the basis of ac circuits and apparatus stanley later wrote of that time i foresaw at that time dimly to be sure but still with suffient accuracy to realisze soemthing of its value that alternating currents could be used to produce and electromotive force upon the circuit to be regulated in place of the battery electromotive forces suggested by brush and the resistance electromotive forces of weston and thomson i do not mean to imitate that at that time i had complete knowledge of the invention  that came later  but that it was the starting point from which i worked until in  the completed system was developed stanley said that in the period prior to industry successes in  it took definite selfconviction to keep working on ac power which was experiencing many setbacks in experiements there were no useful books on the technology and he refers to ac power as a despised and rejected line of work   stanley moves to pittsburgh to work with westinghouse he worked on solving problems in ac distribution but had no alternator to work with he wasted a great deal of time trying to convert dc to ac power for experiments   inventor and industrialist george westinghouse learned of stanleys accomplishments and promoted him as chief engineer at his pittsburgh facility it was during this time that an ac transformer was developed by frenchman lucien gaulard and englishman john gibbsin the spring stanley goes to george westinghouse and asks him to order a siemens generator and gaulard and gibbs transformers from europe stanley believes that the gaulard and gibbs transformer is not commercially useful he believed he could solve the problems in the existing system by having the transformer have each coil operate independently of the others in circuit and have it be selfregulating both in electromotive force and in terms of current transformed george westinghouse jr westinghouse instructed stanley and his assistants albert schmid and oliver b shallenberger to make tests to determine the commercial value of the gaulard and gibbs system he also arranged to have a number of the transformers and a siemens alternatingcurrent generator forwarded from england to pittsburgh stanley working under the direction of westinghouse devised a further improvement which consisted in securing the enclosure of the coils by making the core of eshaped plates the central projections of each successive plate being alternately inserted through rewound coils from opposite sides thus permitting separate winding and consequently the better insulation of the coils   this form was further improved by albert schmid who extended the ends of the arms of the e to meet the central projection when inserting these plates the extensions were temporarily bent upward and upon being released each plate formed a closed magnetic circuit about the sides of the coils schmid was a swiss mechanical engineer working for westinghouse who had worked on some of the earliest dynamos and arc lamp systems in europe above and below stanleys  prototype transformer at the berkshire museum william stanley albert schmid is equipped with knowledge of the european advancements and then develops the first reliable transformer  it uses a soft iron core and adjustable gaps to regulate the amount of electromagnetic field in the secondary winding stanley quickly became unhappy with the siemens generator which he was provided with starting on november th  he developed his own radial pole type alternator and sent the drawings to pittsburgh the move from the sooty city in  ill health almost cut short his career  some say he worked himself too hard stanley had been working in pittsburgh which was andrew carnegies steel town and had the worst air quality in the us it was also known as sooty city and this contributed to william stanleys poor health the move away proved a disguised blessing because it necessitated a move to his family home great barrington massachusetts in those peaceful surroundings he was able to develop some ideas he had suggested two years earlier to his employer george westinghouse who helped finance stanleys lab for a new type of transformer one of  transformers used in the great barrington installation  this work resulted on march   in the demonstration of a prototype system of high voltage transmission employing stanleys parallel connected transformer this system was used by him to provide lighting for offices and stores on the towns main street read more about it in the link below the first full successful ac distribution system in the world read more about william stanleys work in great barrington click here stanley received a patent on his transformer inductioncoil patent no  william stanley explains to franklin l pope adviser to westinghouse and patent lawyer that is design was salable and a great improvement pope disagrees but westinghouse decides to trust stanley anyway these various inventions and discoveries led up within a year to commercial production of transformers of high efficiency and excellent regulating qualities the development was a fine engineering performance in speed and in quality the most important single contribution was by stanley he brought out the parallel connection in which the transformers are connected in parallel across the constantpotential alternatingcurrent system instead of being arranged in series as in the gaulard and gibbs connection he obtained patents on the method involving the construction of transformers in which the counter electromotive force generated in the primary coil of the transformer was practically equal to the electromotive force of the supply circuit this is obvious now but in  when the principles and characteristics of the alternating current were practically unknown it was a wonderful invention and revolutionary in character on this invention stanleys fame largely rests of course stanley did not discover or invent a theory of counter electromotive force before any one else had thought of it such fundamental things seldom happen in invention his claim to great and original merit rests on the discovery of a theory which was new to him and the use of it in making a structure of immense importance in the affairs of men briefly all transformers now made are built upon practically the same principles as those that were developed in these early products of the westinghouse company william stanley photo by alfred a costello prepared by the housatonic river walk great barrington land conservancy westinghouses dysfunctional team in the s and early s george westinghouse had a team of some of the best engineers in the world william stanley louis stillwell albert schmid benjamin lamme oliver shallenberger and nikola tesla meanwhile jp morgan was gathering together the best engineers he could find in the ac field people like charles el brown who was one of the earliest proponents of polyphase ac power westinghouse had a clear advantage controlling much of the patents in the worlds most lucrative marketnorth america however underneath this appearance of success was a pile of eccentric and oddball personalities shallenberger and stillwell worked together well but stanley had differences with some and tesla had trouble working with any of them whether it was egos corporate environment or simple antisocial behavior found in geniuses the eventual result was inventors breaking off to do their own thing while they tried to make as much as possible off of royalties souring relations we will ruin you  unknown person at westinghouse electric george westinghouse came up to see the working system at great barrington with his entourage and was pleased but with time things began to sour between william stanley and westinghouse eventually stanley had a falling out with george over money it was said that westinghouses lawyer franklin pope convinced westinghouse to drop stanleys business ironically pope later was killed by one of stanleys transformers while checking on it in his basement in great barrington stanley had ambitions of creating his own electric company on a scale to compete with thomsonhouston edison and westinghouse he was not deterred by a threat from someone at westinghouse that if he left we will ruin you he set up shop in nearby pittsfield ma stanley produced high quality large transformers with the help of cummings c chesney and john forrest kelly to product the skc line of transformers after becoming disillusioned with the electrical business due to the drawn out patent fights he sold to the roeblings family stanley lost control of his company and it became part of general electric chesney moved to schenectady to continue his work while kelly who was a bit of a loner preferred to work on his own skc transformers from stanleys independent years continued to be in use over  years later in places like middle falls ny general electric years stanleys genius continued to influence the industry as he produced newer and better power distribution systems for general electric the stanley works in pittsfield ma develops new power distribution systems at the birth of the power grid stanleys air blast transformers are used in the folsom powerhouse in  and other ge ac power systems stanleys genius was employed in the making of distribution systems for ac power at niagara falls in a project which divided the job between westinghouse and ge the stanley works in pittsfield ma stanley grew tired of the long legal battles required to protect patents as an engineer he found these proceedings draining and frustrating he spent the later years of his life  experimenting with other technologies he developed a better thermos among other things at times he attended honor ceremonies and photo shoots at general electric for his lifetime of achievement but he had already disengaged from the major transformer works in pittsfield in his final years the legacy of stanleys transformer works lived on in pittsfield ma until  when ge closed the plant at the time they had been producing some of the largest transformers in the world for clients around the planet the works were profitable but were closed anyway as part of ges restructuring ge gave westinghouses transformer operation all  years of technology westinghouses operation was in indiana and some of the workers moved there but that was shut down a year later today the only major transformer manufacturing operation still left in the us

see  click on photo to see the movie a video clip of it runs on water the equinox tv program from the uk  featuring stanley stan meyers dune buggy that ran on water hydrogenoxygen fuel in an ice motor on board electrolysis no hydrogen tanks no bombs onboard just water  it ran  miles per gallon the nd best inventor of the century besides tesla who was and will always be  stan is the mustard seed of water powered cars the video left above is a one timed aired news cast from his home town of grove city  ohio that you are not to view the video screen to the right is a segment of the equinox program about stanley aired back in dec  approx see the entire program entitled it runs on water narrated by arthur c clarke in video clips below it is in  parts made possible by andy the wizardking from blackpool england  update stans dune buggy is in canada it was bought off the holbrook family for a down payment and royalty of the duplicating was to follow but was taken to canada so the corp would not have to ay any more money stephen meyer is alive and knew as much as stan did an eye witness to the dune buggy sale said the vw engine ran beautifully they did not run it for many buyers they told most buyers it did not run it was stored in a  story building with no doors sealed in a room so no ne could steal it stans last experiment with that same buggy was running the engine on charged water from his resonant chamber powered by his vic circuit instead of gas into the carb it ran charged water much like what steve ryan from nz did with is hho running motorcycle the vw engine had to be cleaned out with light oil as to not damage the engine as the charged deuterium level water put out nh fumes ammonia from the burning h and nitrogen from the air had a reaction to produce a putrid smell of ammonia the only draw back though ran well and the timing was set right no gasoline just water you can see why stan was taken out he threatened the national security of the jesuit leaders and would destroy the oil corp petrol dollar empire download stans out of print book  the birth of a new technology   pages is ready for you to download in a pdf file  someday energy will be free to all inhabitants of the earth bro andrew  the holy spirit told me this info that is the goal of waterpoweredcar inc part  • part  • part  • part  download the lastest pdf of how he did it  he was a shame to hear that he was poisoned march  and longer with us he died in the parking lot of a restaurant in his home town of grove city ohio sharks came a week later and stole the the dune buggy and all of his experimental equipment according to his brother steve stan said while he was alive that he was threatened many times and would not sell out to arab oil corps the dune buggy was later found and not stolen the holbrook family hid it away in their garage the holbrooks were partners and friends of stan we hear stephen meyers knows as much as stan does but is afraid and says nothing he is working with hho boosting with semi trucks last info that we received the military was going to use this technology in their tanks jeeps etc he had patents on his invention and was ready for production only  to equip your car see the videos above no gasoline just water stanley said he was offered a billion dollars from an arab to basically shelf his idea stan said no this technology is for the people who you suppose poisoned stan a jealous onlooker do you think the oil corps are happy to see a converted car running for free our own us doe and the present administration are heavily involved in the oil business if gw wanted my respectid have inventors like stan on tv and with me in the white house discussing how to save this dying planet and break the bonds of ruled corruption and greed i have read the does hydrogen  fuel cell technology and they dont mention making hydrogen from pure water until the last page they rather get hydrogen from hydrocarbons they dont mention on board hydrogen electrolysis make the egas as you go they talk about hydrogen gas stations at how much per gallon in the mean time make sure the auto parts like your air filter spark plugs and tune up items to make your car as fuel efficient as possible are up to date so what is happening with stans great invention of the th century absolutely nothing are they manufacturing his invention no why not because it would solve all the worlds problems today that is not how politics work money is the ruler here common sense is not for humans only good for outlaws  so called terrorists huh we live in a time when good is spoken of as evil and evil spoken up as good why do i say that because it is true we were told the us twin towers was taken down by airplanes when the truth is it was taken down by c explosives william rodriguez holds the master key he was there that day he lost his job and  of his friends and colleges connect the dots it is that simple sorry to have shocked you and made your face turn red but building  came down in  seconds not reported in the  commission report no planes hit that building only a few office fires happened it was all too fishy from me and continues to stink like a dead rat all they talk about is hydrogen gas stations run by shell and a canadian oil firm then they talk all about hydrogen fuel cells which take a lifetime of gas burned just to make one fuel cell a hydrogen fuel cell factory is a real smog factory to explain better read on there fuel cells are not as efficient as a on board hydrogen electrolysis fuel cell stan made the gas as he drove no hydrogen tanks no fuel cells no need for shell hydrogen stations he spent  years of research all on his own good news stephen meyer stans twin brother lives he is into the same technology he stays low key because he wants to live why is there only one website on him wccocom news  other resources of information auto wash car cleaner cleaning services industrial cleaner to totally learn this technology go to i have some pdf files for you to download all of stans writings circuits etc stanleymeyercom  recent harassment on a stan meyer cell builder in india  we are familiar with the suppression of freeenergy devices in the usa there have been literally thousands of cases  for example bill williams for running his truck on a joe cell t henry moray for pulling kilowatts out of the environment and ed gray for daring to have a power tube with an output power  times the input power in australia there is intense opposition to anyone using the nitro cell on any engine in new zealand to the magnetic motor of robert adams which is  efficient in the uk to devices for watersplitting and permanent magnet motors in japan to teruo kawai’s patented magnetic motor which is  efficient but in the last week there has been an instance of it in india in spite of the fact that the bus service in mumbai has been run on hydrogen for some years now a man who wishes to remain anonymous in order not to aggravate the current situation has just been picked on he has been running a business for the last  years and has a good relationship with his local commercial taxation office staff he became interested in dave lawton’s replication and decided to try it for himself the seven pictures which i have placed in the files section of the group in the folder “ravzz” show his high standard of workmanship he encountered a minor problem with his implementation of the electronic driving circuit and so contacted dave lawton for technical advice this was given and the problem solved he then emailed dave some pictures showing his progress within  hours his premises were raided by nine people supposedly from the local tax office in actual fact six of them were from the local office and the other three were unknown to the locals who had been ordered to take them along during their search of the place the man was told that he would be well advised to discontinue all work connected to hydrogen that shows clearly that the “raid” had nothing whatsoever to do with taxation and the tax office was just being used as an excuse to invade the privacy of an individual they spent six hours checking everything eventually left taking commercial records with them and subsequently requested that our friend attend their local office on wednesday the day before yesterday he attended sensibly taking people from his business as witnesses the six local officials were there and they returned the records taken stating that there was nothing wrong with the records or the tax position they also said that they were bewildered by the whole affair he asked them about the other three men and they said that the commissioners office had asked them to take them alongand they have no idea who they were he then had a long conversation with the deputy commercial tax officer who had came over to his place he also seemed confused as to why they were hurried up to go over to his place from the commissioners office he said that the commissioners office received a complaint from some higher authorities and these people were given written instructions an unusual thing in itself to go to his office and make some checks usually this happens but the visits are done after  days of the receipt of the letter from the commissioners office based on the time allotment but in this case there were  calls directly from the commissioners office to go over to his place immediately  this is a typical case of deliberate intimidation and it is unusual only because it is in india it also shows that dave lawton’s emails are being intercepted and read as this man did not mention his hydrogen work to anyone else dave once made the mistake of applying for a development grant from his local authority the grant was to help develop one of his inventions he was visited by two unpleasant individuals who took away his written proposal nothing ever came of it and when dave asked for his documents back they lied saying that they has posted them when he pressured them they did eventually send the documents back and the date stamp on the envelope shows that the documents were posted long after they originally claimed that they had been sent it turns out that these men have no connection with the local authority grants section and it seems clear that they fall into the same category as the three “unknown” men in india who carried out the raid presumably dave’s phone calls and emails have been intercepted and monitored ever since and that is what triggered the raid in india the raid in india is very interesting in that it shows clearly that the opposition are very much afraid of stan meyer’s water fuel cell this implies that the cell is capable of producing serious amounts of freeenergy and can break our dependency on fossil fuels february     the banned book download it  free oil corps bought up all these ideas for millions now you take a look i encourage everyone to read and learn to pass this knowledge on an open field of research into free energy stan meyers took  years of research in his invention he know all aspects of hydrogen  oxygen he learned the special frequency to cause  times the explosion of egas production in electrolysis above is stans company logo wpcs logo is similar honoring stans  tongues of flame father son  holy spirit job  have you entered the treasuries of the snow or have you seen the treasures of the hail in which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war stans pdf files download for more info and a great explanation of stans work go to waterfuelcellorg       stanley meyer waterfuel cell inventor  promoter dies suddenly by dr gene mallove another inventor who was murdered stanley a meyer the controversial ohio inventor who had claimed his technology could produce a hydrogenoxygen mixture with a minimal energy input compared with conventional electrolysis died on march   he did not have a worldwide following like he should have few people have heard of him there were also those of adherents and people who had invested in his activities  water fuel cell grove city oh he was famous for his claimed water fueled car which was exhibited symbolically in the bbccbc  documentary on cold fusion too close to the sun we were initially curious about meyers work the late christopher tinsley of the uk and the late admiral of the british navy sir anthony griffin but who became frustrated by being unable  or more to the point not allowed  to confirm or reject meyers claims it makes no sense that after discovering the technological process that he had why there is no way that a reasonable straightforward marketing strategy would have failed to make his technology quickly spread worldwide he could have become very influential and very rich there remains a very strong suspicion that he had no such process from his enemies oil corp cartels even though he conducted a demonstration before this writer and another engineer at the meyer lab in  of the production of copious hydrogenoxygen gas from what visually seemed like a small input power but meyer was exceedingly paranoid and he flatly refused reasonable requests by us and others to test the performance  the inputout power ratio even with the proviso that we did not have to look into his black box of electronics feeding his rather simply constructed stainless steel electrode alternating current and voltage cell the last such refusal  this one in public and recorded on video tape  was at the ane meeting in denver co in  then meyer loudly and falsely protested that he would lose his patent rights if he were to release anything but complete integrated systems  such as a waterfueled vehicle in  meyer lost a longlasting
