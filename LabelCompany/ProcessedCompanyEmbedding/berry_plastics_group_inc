customization for each customer making the prospect of that customer abandoning the business relationship expensive it could even be substantiated that this company can well be the difference between a consumers purchase of its customers products or not thats a company definitely worth a second look for a longterm investor berry plastics nysebery began trading on the nyse in october  but the company has been in business since  berry provides plastic consumerpackaging and engineered materials it operates in four segments rigid open top rigid closed top engineered materials and flexible packaging revenue is spread somewhat evenly across the four segments at  billion  billion  billion and  million respectively based on the trailing twelve months as well no single customer represents more than  of revenue according to the  annual report even the top ten customers represent only  of revenue products include containers closures bottles prescription vials tubes drink cups plates bowls pitchers flowerpots closures overcaps spouts spice containers tapes stretch films foodservice films liners drop cloths trash bags and the like custom solutions for medical applications anticorrosion applications the oil and gas industry and the construction industry are niche markets key to its operations are a vast product library of proprietary and customerspecific molds patents and technologies besides production berry offers conceptual design graphic arts services and a full roster of decorating options including all types of labeling hotstamping and screen printing the breadth and depth of its services are what would make switching suppliers difficult timeconsuming and costly for its customers still berry prides itself on staying on the forefront of technology for the benefit of its customers it also strives to minimize costs for its customers by such activities as being a major purchaser of raw materials and by employing packing technologies to minimize shipping and warehousing costs berry recognizes that packaging is a significant valueadd to consumer products relative to form function and branding demands in the industry include brand recognition improvement in safety and convenience new and improved functionality barrier protection thermal management incorporation of trackandtrace technology and environmental friendliness according to the deal pipeline the packaging industry raked in  billion in  and is expected to grow to  billion by  of the  total  or  billion went to plastics as evidence of the growth of the plastics segment of the packaging industry in  plastics represented  of the industry and in   the whole industry has been in a consolidation stage for some time starting with a record year in  in  there were  merger and acquisition transactions in the industry earlier this month five packaging companies in north america and europe merged to form the sixth largest packaging company in the world attractive candidates for acquisition typically offer new technology or solutions to a niche market or expansion into a new locality berry does  of its business domestically from over  locations in the united states the majority of locations are a result of acquisition in  years berry acquired  companies including  since  and as a result it has manufacturing facilities in mexico india the netherlands and belgium germany australia brazil and malaysia during the first quarter of  berry made its first capital investment in brazil packaging is primarily a local process empty containers are not usually shipped internationally so berry set further international growth as a shortterm goal its focus is on highgdpgrowth areas such as latin america asia and brazil however it is tracking well behind the worlds largest plasticspackaging company australianbased amcor with a  billion market cap and  operations sites in  countries competitors sonoco products nyseson with  sites in  countries and sealed air nysesee with  sites in  countries are also well ahead of berry relative to international presence with a wellestablished domestic business and reputation and a possibility of international growth there are compelling reasons to stock up on berry plastics analysts have given berry one of the largest estimates for longterm growth in the industry at  berry claims to outpace all its competitors regarding ebitda margins at  yet berry has a looming and haunting challenge  debt with only  million in cash and  billion in longterm debt berry carries the risk of not being able to expand through acquisition it does have borrowing capacity of  million but the ability to incur additional debt could be limited cash flow must be first directed to its indebtedness for  berry budgeted  million for new products organic growth and international expansion to its credit berry has reducing leverage as one of its four key initiatives in february berry refinanced some of its debt to decrease annual interest expense which resulted in credit ratings upgrades in the six months between its fiscal yearend in september  and second quarter reporting in march  it decreased its debt obligation by over  but to rely on that as a trend is unsettling when one reviews the past few years performance in three of the last  years    berry incurred an annual loss the profit in  was just  million or  per share its not that the packaging industry tends to be debtfree and berry plastics alone has a challenge rather the industry on average carries a longterm debt to equity ratio of well over  at  by definition the higher the ratio the more risky the stock some experts recommend caution when the calculation results in a ratio over  considering berry has negative shareholder equity just makes the situation even more worrisome there is no denying that berrys customer list impressively attracts investment interest theres also no denying its debt and recent losses have the ability to depressively repel interest if that same debt level impairs its ability to expand organically or internationally berrys growth potential could be repressed until that debt level decreases longterm investors leery of

plastics corp packaging extrusion film  sheet injection molding thermoforming more  updated — berry plastics group inc is changing its name and adopting a new logo in a move that is both a nod to the company’s past and a look toward the future the evansville indbased company will become berry global group inc april  and is already using the new logo changes which include a new set of company values and mission statement have been in the works since last fall when tom salmon became chief operating officer in anticipation of succeeding jon rich as ceo in february “for those of us who have been with the company for a while it really represents who we are today it’s just a fresh clean look” salmon said in a telephone interview from geneva switzerland where the company unveiled the moves april  “you have to look at it comprehensively between the name change the mission and the core values” berry now has  domestic and  international locations is looking to follow customers to different parts of the world as they continue to expand but the company will not grow for growth’s sake the ceo said “the majority of our business resides in north america it’s incredibly important to us it’s always going to be an incredibly important region to us but we also have to make certain that we’ve got the ability to deliver value internationally as well and that is definitely aspirational for us we’re going to be very smart about that we’re going to do that in a methodical measured way but our end customers expect it” salmon said a  acquisition of nonwovens maker avintiv inc with operations in  countries helped broaden berry’s international geography “there is opportunity where customers want to take advantage of those core values that berry represents we feel that our business has to reflect the opportunities that exist in other regions of the world we’re going to be prudent in evaluating those opportunities and making certain that it makes sense for our end customers but also our shareholders” salmon said virtually all of berry’s products use plastics “in one way or another” salmon said and the ceo does not believe eliminating the word “plastics” from the company’s name will have any impact berry plastics group inc salmon “plastics remain incredibly important to us it’s a core competency of ours it’s always going to be but we didn’t want to limit our thinking we didn’t want to limit it to that substrate in and of itself and we just felt that what’s important is ‘berry’ people know who we are” he said “that’s what people always refer to us as in the marketplace ‘berry’ they never use ‘berry plastics’” salmon said “i think this captures the essence of who we’ve been and who we really are” aside from the name change the company also has adopted a mission statement “always advancing to protect what’s important” the new logo features a diamond shaped icon in the upper right hand corner consisting of four parts each of a different color those sections represent the company’s new values of partnerships excellence growth and safety these values salmon said are high standards “but they are standards we expect to achieve and deliver on those commitments and those promises to our customers every day” berry also is changing the name of a wholly owned subsidiary from berry plastics corp to berry global inc the company unveiled the changes in conjunction with index  in geneva which bills itself as the world’s largest nonwovens exhibition berry is now a  billion company with more than  locations a far cry from the singlelocation business in evansville with less than  million in annual sales in  when the company became berry plastics salmon said “we think this is a fresh look for our company” salmon said about the changes “we’re excited
