approach to risk and allstate is the resource broker for this collaboration by accurately and efficiently assessing and managing claims we continue to be a force for good and maintain the trust of our valued customers by innovating we ensure our business successfully maneuvers the rapid industry transitions due to advances in information technology knowledge management the world’s workforce is changing and the learning and training preferences of millennials are different from past generations they prefer digital centralized media to support our evolving claims team in  allstate began implementing our knowledge management system we customized and designed the system to provide claims employees with uniform information this includes centralized training content that is palatable to a widerange of employees today our claims process is increasingly streamlined and consistent this strategy also • increases employee efficiency improving customer experience • improves the quality of claims handling • reduces informal training time • reduces redundant resources and effort needed to create distribute and maintain we know the customer experience begins and ends with our employees our team’s capability to deliver high quality and consistent claims experiences is at the core of driving high customer satisfaction continuous improvement continuous improvement ci is a management system that improves customer experience agency owner and staff experience and business outcomes by empowering employees to advance their work methodology the ci deployments have generated excitement and significant impact around employee engagement customer experience and efficiency dimensions to date we have implemented ci in all claims express operations by yearend  all auto field operations will participate in the ci environment totaling more than  claims offices efforts are underway to deploy a systemic ci model across the remaining claims lines of business this approach will be piloted at the senior leadership level and include a national deployment strategy and a rootcause problemsolving database our goal is to complete the implementation of ci across all claims offices by the end of  preventative home care many of us know of preventative healthcare in that same vein allstate is helping homeowners consider preventative care of their homes our home checkup program gives our customers an indepth assessment of their home to help them better understand their risks and provide recommendations of maintenance measures we tailor the assessment conducted onsite by an allstate inspector to the interests and home care goals of each customer simplifying the claims process we work hard to ensure our claims process is as simple and stress free as possible by continuously improving our claims process we drive customer retention and satisfaction in  we undertook an assessment of our claims process called end  end the assessment found customers prefer interacting with one claims professional throughout the process rather than multiple people in response allstate now assigns a claim owner to each case the owner is responsible for the entirety of the claims process including • reaching an agreement on liability with the atfault insurance carrier and expediting the customer deductible upon agreement • informing insureds and claimants when supplemental damage to their vehicles is identified and explaining the impact to repair time and rental car extension • incorporating the explanation of medical payment or personal injury protection coverage and process as part of the initial loss factgathering contact rather than having a medical specialist perform the explanation results of the trial show the average number of claims professionals our customers encountered dropped from  to  in  in  we began migrating all of our claims processes to this new model including our property claims beyond the clear benefits to our customers we found this process improved our claims handlers’ familiarity with the claims process as a whole further it improves their ability to establish personal relationships with our customers because of their increased interaction in light of this success we are committing more resources to continuous improvement in this area quantitative research and analytics allstate’s quantitative research and data analytics team works to leverage our data management system nextgen to identify and prevent risks to our customers while this system provides our workforce with actionable tasks the team maximizes its value by

deshaw dc jd with a foreword by eugene r anderson the book relates profitboosting strategies that consulting firm mckinsey  company presented to allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim mckinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for fortune  companies including controversial clients such as enron to maximize profits mckinsey’s recommendation to allstate according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves  the book was reviewed by business week magazine according to that article allstate responded to berardinellis allegations by claiming that berardinellis allegations were unfounded and unproven rather than trying to cheat customers the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying exaggerated and fraudulent claims and that its processes are absolutely sound    to investigate evaluate and promptly resolve each claim fairly based on the merits court decisions on the issues debated by berardinelli and allstate have gone both ways according to the business week article as of  courts and regulators in a number of states including new york pennsylvania and washington have forced allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial do i need

from good hands to boxing glovesedit this is the title of a book written by david berardinelli jd michael freeman phd dc mph and aaron deshaw dc jd with a foreword by eugene r anderson the book relates profitboosting strategies that consulting firm mckinsey  company presented to allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim mckinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for fortune  companies including controversial clients such as enron to maximize profits mckinsey’s recommendation to allstate according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves  the book was reviewed by business week magazine according to that article allstate responded to berardinellis allegations by claiming that berardinellis allegations were unfounded and unproven rather than trying to cheat customers the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying exaggerated and fraudulent claims and that its processes are absolutely sound    to investigate evaluate and promptly resolve each claim fairly based on the merits court decisions on the issues debated by berardinelli and allstate have gone both ways according to the business week article as of  courts and regulators in a
