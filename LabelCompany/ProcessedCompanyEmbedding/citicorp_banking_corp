citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the investigation bowens charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbanes–oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasnt so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank the financial crisis inquiry commission asked him to testify about citigroups role in the mortgage crisis and he did so appearing as one of the first witnesses before the commission in april  as the crisis began to unfold citigroup announced on april   that it would eliminate  jobs or about  percent of its workforce in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock even after securities and brokerage firm bear stearns ran into serious trouble in summer  citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its cdos was so tiny less than  of  that they excluded them from their risk analysis with the crisis worsening citigroup announced on january   that it was considering cutting another  percent to  percent of its  memberworkforce collapse  us government intervention edit by november  citigroup was insolvent despite its receipt of  billion in taxpayer funded federal troubled asset relief program

citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the investigation bowens charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbanes–oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasnt so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank the financial crisis inquiry commission asked him to testify about citigroups role in the mortgage crisis and he did so appearing as one of the first witnesses before the commission in april  as the crisis began to unfold citigroup announced on april   that it would eliminate  jobs or about  percent of its workforce in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock even after securities and brokerage firm bear stearns ran into serious trouble in summer  citigroup decided the possibility of trouble

citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the investigation bowens charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbanes–oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasnt so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his

citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the

citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial

citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses
