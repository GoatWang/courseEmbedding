malaysia index fund  ewm saw new options become available today for the january  expiration one of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay is the time value so with  days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration at stock options channel our yieldboost formula has looked up and down the ewm options chain for the new january  contracts and identified the following put contract of particular interest the put contract at the  strike price has a current bid of  if an investor was to selltoopen that put contract they are committing to purchase the stock at  but will also collect the premium putting the cost basis of the shares at  before broker commissions to an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ewm that could represent an attractive alternative to paying share today because the  strike represents an approximate  discount to the current trading price of the stock in other words it is outofthemoney by that percentage there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless the current analytical data including greeks and implied greeks suggest the current odds of that happening are  stock options channel will track those odds over time to see how they change publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract should the contract expire worthless the premium would represent a  return on the cash commitment or  annualized — at stock options channel we call this the yieldboost if you liked this article you might like which country has the longest bull market the answer will surprise you this
