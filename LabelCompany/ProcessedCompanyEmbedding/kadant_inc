technology inc and created a division called grantek that produced granules from sludge that were used for example as a carrier for agricultural chemicals and pesticides the original plan was that fibergen would build its plants adjacent to papermaking plants to process their waste but this plan failed because it required papermaking plants to commit to longterm contracts to dispose of their waste which they were unwilling to do the granule business became the focus of fibergen helped in part by enzymologist anatole klyosov in  the company acquired black clawson for  million in  thermo
