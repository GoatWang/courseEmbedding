dominic p orr michael m galvin keerti melkote defendantsappellees united states court of appeals ninth circuit argued and submitted february   — san francisco california filed march   not for publication memorandum par investment partners lp appeals the district courts order dismissing its second amended putative class action complaint with prejudice for failure to allege that aruba networks inc and three of its executives made material misrepresentations or omissions regarding the competition for market share in the wireless networking industry we affirm  material misrepresentation or omission par investments underlying theory of securities fraud rests on allegations that throughout the class period aruba misrepresented and failed to disclose certain information regarding cisco systems incs business operations in the market for wireless networking products and services as the district court correctly held these allegations do not constitute actionable securities fraud companies and their executives generally cannot be held liable for securities fraud based on their alleged failure to disclose information regarding a competitors business operations when as here the company has already made detailed disclosures concerning the risk of competition in re stac electronics securities litigation  fd   th cir  throughout the class period aruba made numerous public statements regarding the specific competitive threat posed by cisco for example at the february   quarterly earnings call aruba disclosed to investors and market analysts that beginning in november  cisco had implemented a new sales campaign that shifted its focus away from competing head on on a technological ground with aruba ie based solely on the quality of each companys respective wireless networking products and was instead attempting to compete with aruba through aggressive pricing bundling of wired and wireless products and data center upgrades in addition to these specific disclosures aruba also made several general disclosures regarding the competition for market share with cisco for example arubas form k for the fiscal year ending july   identified cisco as amongst its primary competitors and stated that aruba expected competition to intensify in the future which could result in increasing pricing pressure reduced profit margin    and failure to increase or the loss of market share any of which could seriously harm arubas business operating results or financial condition consistent with these disclosures multiple public analyst reports acknowledged that as early as august  ciscos wireless bundling strategies posed a significant competitive threat to aruba given these disclosures arubas carefullyworded public statements regarding ciscos business operations and their effect on arubas revenue market share and success rate were not materially misleading and therefore do not satisfy the heightened pleading standards under the private securities litigation reform act  usc ub see brody v transitional hospitals corp  fd   th cir  holding that to be actionable an omission must affirmatively create an impression of a state of affairs that differs in a material way from the one that actually exists emphasis added see also oregon public employees retirement fund v apollo group inc  fd   th cir  the plaintiffs omissions theory fails to state a claim because the defendants clearly disclosed material information to investors  dismissal with prejudice as lead plaintiff and putative class representative par investment has filed two complaints asserting the same underlying theory of securities fraud on appeal par investment has failed to provide any new allegations that would support its securities fraud claim the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the action with prejudice see zucco partners llc v digimarc corp  fd   th cir  as amended feb   holding that the district court did not err when it dismissed a private securities plaintiffs second amended putative class action complaint with prejudice since it was clear that the plaintiffs had made their best case and had been found wanting affirmed footnotes  the honorable marvin j garbis united states district judge for the district of maryland sitting by designation  this disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by ninth circuit rule   we grant arubas requests for judicial notice of various court filings public sec filings and public analyst reports for the
