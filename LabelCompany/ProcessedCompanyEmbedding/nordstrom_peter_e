was judicious about not opening too many new stores avoiding many of the pitfalls that are driving other retailers to ruinbut even from a position of relative strength nordstrom is struggling to navigate a broad upending of the retail industry as shopping malls lose their appeal and more customers choose to buy goods onlineon thursday members of the family that founded nordstrom in seattle a century ago — and who still own a substantial portion of its shares — said they were exploring ways to shift the company into private ownership advertisement continue reading the main story the

continue reading the main story it also reflects optimism that a private equity firm or a sovereign wealth fund would be willing to invest in a large retailer after many major investors got burned in debtfueled buyouts that went bust“nordstrom is the best of the breed” said david shiffman a managing director and a head of the retail group at peter j solomon company an investment banking advisory firm “this is not a laggard throwing in the towel”still considering going private is an acknowledgment that the public stock market is not a friendly place for companies needing to make costly changes as they compete with online giants like amazonby making such a move nordstrom would duck the glare of public shareholders and the pressure to constantly produce shortterm profits“this is a clear signal that the changes that retailers need to make are much more extensive and expensive than public shareholders have the appetite for” said joel bines a managing director focused on retail at alixpartners an advisory firmtraditional retailers are in a free fall as physical stores fade as enjoyable dynamic places to spend an afternoon on thursday the canadian company that owns saks fifth

far less than other department stores’ shares but analysts complain that investors have lumped the company in with significantly troubled retailers leaving its stock undervaluedthat could be another motivation for finding a private partner“the family is saying they have conviction in the business and see value far beyond where the street is willing to own the stock” mr shiffman saidnordstrom was cofounded by the swedish immigrant john w nordstrom who had moved out west and eventually to alaska in search of gold he settled in seattle where he teamed up with a shoemaker carl f wallin they opened their first store in members of the nordstrom family have had the retail business in their blood from the start and their name has left an indelible mark on seattle a medical office tower in
