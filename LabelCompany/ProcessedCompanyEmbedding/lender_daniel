closing and dan discloses that theres an issue with our home appraisal from two weeks ago that was still not resolved this was something that was completely out of our my husband and is hands if it were not for the seller of the home we may still be in escrow needless to say we closed escrow late but the worst part of it all was that we had to pay a rescheduling fee for our moving services we

a flawed and tainted appraisal initially but dan  kara stepped up and paid for a nd appraisal for us which we were able to use for closing of our refinance the process was a long one but was not due to any of their control and what they had control over was flawless kara  dan are both very well spoken and eloquent in their emails my preferred form of contact as i often find myself in the field

many issues with the loan process information was sometimes requested very last minute even though i gave them everything they asked for initially they took out money for my property taxes at closing i then found out that my previous lender already paid that so i had to request and wait to get my funds back if i never checked with my previous lendor who knows what would have happened to my money
