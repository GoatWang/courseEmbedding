business technology science health sports opinion arts style travel jobs real estate autos working profile energy secretary john s herrington working profile energy secretary john s herrington slayer of plans he finds too costly by robert d hershey jr special to the new york times published august  9 washington aug — in the mid9s a young california lawyer and boxing enthusiast helped organize a syndicate to invest in what he still considers to be the fastest hardesthitting middleweight ive ever seen after initial success in which the fighter rose to no  more money was needed and the dozen syndicate members had to decide whether to raise their  stakes some guys wanted to put more money in recalled the organizer john s herrington i said no since taking over as secretary of energy six months ago mr herrington has made at least two major decisions in which he refused to raise the ante for dubious propositions one was to alter radically the governments multibilliondollar uranium enrichment business closing facilities in ohio and tennessee great plains project rebuffed then late last month mr herrington announced that the administration would not further aid the  billion great plains coal gasification plant the nations most ambitious synthetic fuel project this prompted the five corporate sponsors to default on their construction loan and left his department with ownership of an uneconomic plant that might have to be mothballed after completion some people have therefore begun to call mr herrington a whiteelephant slayer a characterization that seems to bother the yearold californian not at all these are dollarsandcents decisions he insists business decisions the way i approach this is that when you put money into projects you are taking it from the people do you take  billion out for the portsmouth gas centrifuge plant when you know its unneeded and uncompetitive do you pull out another couple of billion for great plains my answer is no for a man who like three of his four predecessors has no experience in energy mr herrington has made quite an impact in his brief tenure while remaining perhaps the least known cabinet member besides the uranium enrichment and synfuels decisions he might have been instrumental this summer in persuading president reagan not to seek an import fee on oil and refined products and some think he may be on his way to winning a reversal of interior secretary donald p hodels decision to restrict severely the acreage available for oil and gas uses on the outer continental shelf he favors reagan decision although he maintains mr reagan took his own counsel in rejecting the import fee proposed by senate republicans mr herrington argues it was clearly the right decision in addition to its being a tax which the administration has long said it will not accept an import fee would have put us back into the business of deciding winners and losers mr herrington says the energy department as administrator would have been pressed for exceptions for such special claimants as in the northeast which uses more heating oil than other areas california which relies heavily on the automobile and ailing petrochemical producers earlier this month mr herrington caused yet another stir when the head of the economic regulatory administration an energy department unit quit after mr herrington turned down a proposal to expand the prosecution of oil companies over  billion in overcharges under price controls which were lifted early in 9 this is 9 he says this is  years after the initial legislation mind you he said at a time when im trying to end this program of the regulatory administrations lawyers he said you cant blame them for being inventive but this is 9 while mr herrington seeks to play down his disagreement with mr hodel  were good friends  he has at his fingertips an article in which mr hodel said a year ago that he found it incredible that the country would impose a moratorium on offshore leasing mr herrington who sometimes confounds aides with his candor came to the department from the white house where he was a presidential assistant for personnel and a sometime troubleshooter after high school in los angeles mr herrington went to stanford majoring in economics and on to earn two law degrees at the university of california in san francisco in practice he soon expanded into real estate development ranching and the restoration of historic buildings his association with mr reagan began in 9 when as a prosecutor in ventura county he worked as a precinct organizer in the reagan gubernatorial campaign two years later he became an advance man for the national campaign he seeks to restore post although some in the energy department are complaining about recent resignations and five unfilled senior posts mr herrington has moved to restore the abolished job of assistant secretary for health environment and safety because the department is the successor to the energy research and development administration and the atomic energy commission it has responsibility for many dangerous waste sites dating as far back as world war ii he has given a cleanup program high priority this department has more environmental problems i think than any other department in the government mr herrington says mr herrington has given up boxing and motorcycle riding and limits himself now to tennis golf and skiing he lives in mclean va commuting with his wife lois an assistant attorney general who works across the mall their two daughters are at college in southern california mr herrington well aware of how vulnerable officials are to charges about the use of perquisites is careful to ask his driver to drop his wife off first before taking him to the forrestal building he says i dont want her riding around town in a government car of the job he says there are problems there are frustrations but nothing unexpected management he adds is what i like best photo of john s
