small business innovation research award phase i “oral transmucosal drug delivery system for systemic delivery of nicotine”nida national institute of drug abuse nihaugust many drugabuse medications eg nicotine cannot be effectively administered orally alternate drug delivery systems are therefore needed for drug abuse studies and in treatment clinics the dosage form should also be convenient for administration costeffective and provide controlled pharmacological actions we propose an oral transmucosal system that provides a rapid onset of drug action to address period of acute craving followed by a prolonged release of the drug to maintain a lower constant drug plasma concentration such dual drugrelease delivery system addresses the therapeutic gap problems of the fastonset dosage forms eg injections and nasal sprays and sustainedrelease delivery systems such as transdermal patches and depot implants also this simple singledosage form offers convenience of dose administration thus ensures compliance is less expensive vs implants transdermal nasal and inhalation devices and improves bioavailability of drugs with high firstpass metabolism or significant gastrointestinal

transmucosal drug delivery system for naltrexone for alcohol dependence treatment”niaaa national institute of alcoholism and alcohol abuse nihseptember proposed research this proposed sbir phase i project will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a novel oral transmucosal drug delivery method and dosage form for alcohol dependence treatment the proposed system is a small thin and flexible film containing the treatment drug naltrexone it is applied intraorally to affect a rapid onset of action followed by moderate release of drug for extended pharmacological action the phase i project will consist of design fabrication and in vitro evaluation of thinfilm dosage forms the dosage form is applied “as needed” when alcohol craving occurs the methoddosage form is costeffective convenient can be administered without water and could fill the gaps of current patient and market needsproblemopportunity there are two naltrexone products marketed for treatment of alcohol dependence oral tablets and injectable depot formulation the former suffers from low bioavailability poor patient compliance and significant side effects the later overcomes bioavailability and patient compliance problems but is expensive inconvenient and has injection site reaction proposed drug delivery system is expected to overcome the poor oral bioavailability of the oral naltrexone tablets and high cost and inconvenience of the injectable naltrexone depot formulations results from this study are anticipated to lead to better efficacy more convenient and better patient compliance of alcoholdependence medical treatment and thus improve the health of alcoholism patients this market sector is presently underserved and has substantial potential the proposed technology could be extended and developed

trialssbir small business innovation research award phase iiniaaa national institute of alcoholism and alcohol abuse nihseptember the proposed sbir phase ii project aims at developing a new drug product the naltrexone orally dissolving film odf for treatment of alcohol dependence the naltrexone odf is a small thin and flexible film containing naltrexone hydrochloride and other excipients it is applied intraorally and adheres to the oral mucosa to affect a rapid onset of action due to oral mucosal absorption followed by an extended pharmacological action the naltrexone odf is administered  to  minutes prior to a drinking episode or asneeded when alcohol craving occurs the naltrexone odf is novel costeffective convenient to use dissolves in the mouth without the need for water and fills the gaps of current treatment regimens and market needs phase i of this project was highly successful wherein the specific aims were met in demonstrating the feasibility of developing a prototype naltrexone odf formulation which met the targeted milestone having optimal functional properties the phase ii program will extend to product development earlycommercialization phase by validating the prototype formulation with indenabling safety studies technology transfer and scaleup and manufacturing of clinical supplies problemopportunity naltrexone is an approved drug for treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence there are two naltrexone drug products marketed for treatment of alcohol dependence oral tablets and injectable depot formulation the former suffers from low bioavailability poor

phase i awardnih nidaaugust project title abuse deterrent transdermal drug delivery system for fentanyl pain is the single greatest cause of disability and its management remains one of medicine’s foremost challenges potent opiates can effectively reduce the severity of pain thereby diminishing patient suffering unfortunately chronic use of these drugs can be harmful to patients whether by inadvertent overdosing unintentional addiction or abuse resulting from dependency on the euphoric effects of the opiate the magnitude of this problem as a public health issue has led fda to require the engineering of abusedeterrence mechanisms into all new products in this class the applicants seek to determine the feasibility of developing an abusedeterrent analgesic which relies on a novel approach to administering an opioid via a transdermal patch the most common methods of abuse involve either snorting swallowing or injecting the contents of the product therefore this patch would contain both a potent opioid agonist and an antagonist upon oral nasal or intravenous administration of the contents of the product both agonist and antagonist would become bioavailable thereby substantially blunting or eliminating opioidinduced euphoria however when applied as a skin patch only the agonist not the antagonist would be available for absorption through the skinthe aims of this project are  design synthesis and evaluation releasability through hydrolysis of modified antagonists  design preparation and evaluation of transdermal patch containing the opioid drug and modified antagonists along with patch evaluation and  testing and evaluation of abusedeterrent properties of the transdermal patch formulations in short the above objectives will employ chemical synthesis of the modified antagonists analysis of quantities of agonist and antagonist released from the patch under the various study conditions and in vitro human skin permeation studiespublicationseffect of
