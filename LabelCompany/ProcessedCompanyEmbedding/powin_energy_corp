management does not believe the current cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs including cash for working capital and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future the company will likely require additional cash resources that will require the company to sell additional equity securities or debt securities the sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to the companys stockholders the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations and liquidity the companys ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties including investors perception of and demand for securities of alternative manufacturing companies conditions of the united states and other capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds and future results of operations financial condition and cash flow therefore the companys management cannot assure that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company if at all any failure by the companys management to raise additional funds on terms favorable to the company could have a material adverse effect on the companys liquidity and financial
