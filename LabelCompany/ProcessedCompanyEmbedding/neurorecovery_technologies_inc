ride the lab coattails of usc ucla and caltech caltech neurorecovery technologies inc product implantable spinal cord neuromodulator with highdensity electrode array chief executive nick terrafranca jr year founded  location los angeles what does the product do our technology provides electrical stimulation in a defined pattern to the spinal cord “waking it up” enabling it to recognize the sensory information being gathered by the nerves in our bodies and acting upon this information by delivering the appropriate command signal to restore voluntary movement and function for paralyzed people what was the idea that led to the creation of the company existing technologydevices did not provide the optimum response our theory that the brain was not necessary to restore voluntary movement and function was demonstrated in numerous animal models leading to proof in human experiments the answer was within the spinal cord the key mechanism had been worked out the appropriate device to facilitate the action needed to be made what has been the benefit of spinning the company out of caltech immediate credibility with investors recognition for partnering with prestigious universities and worldrenowned scientists strong ip what has been the biggest change since spinning off a change in mindset gathering an understanding and appreciation for how the business sector
