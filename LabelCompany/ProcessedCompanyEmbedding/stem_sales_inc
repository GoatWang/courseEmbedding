pharmacist pharmacists provide an indispensable service to nearly all of us they must use their knowledge of biology chemistry physiology and medicine to help patients understand the risks and benefits of medications  pharmacists work with patients physicians and insurance companies to ensure the best care possible for the patients pharmacists must use their scientific knowledge every day to make sure that patients are safe and healthy their knowledge and use of science in their daily activities is extensive some pharmacists make their own medicine which requires them to use scientific tools to compound different substances most pharmacists work in pharmacies though some work for hospitals or in research facilities students interested in pharmacy should know that pharmacists are required to have a doctor of pharmacy in order to practice the pharmd degree may be pursued after a student begins his or her undergraduate college career students should begin in high school with courses in biology and chemistry in college advanced courses in biology chemistry and anatomy and physiology will all be necessary to gain admission to a pharmd program          becoming a pharmacist

its composition its irregularities its structure — to learn more about its history and to tell us its secrets geoscientists use their knowledge of geology physics and chemistry to study the earth geoscientists often work out in the field to take samples of rock and ice and then return to a lab to analyze these samples they support other fields such as architecture oil and natural gas cartography among others their knowledge of the earth is indispensable to our development of new technologies that help us live healthier cleaner and safer lives     students who are interested in becoming geoscientists should begin taking math and physics in high school in college students should major in geosciences geology or earth sciences other degrees such as physics or chemistry will allow a student to pursue higher education in a geosciences career if they also took some work in the geosciences many geoscientists choose to pursue a doctorate so that they can conduct their own research              geoscience is a rocksolid career choice the united states economy is predicted to increase its demand for geoscientists by  percent from  to  according to the bureau of labor

others look like both parents some siblings practically look like identical twins while other siblings couldn’t look more different why are some genes passed down through generations while others aren’t ask a geneticist a geneticist studies genes and tries to understand how characteristics are inherited by a new generation of a species why might someone be interested in such a field geneticists are working to tell us how we can decrease the chances of a child inheriting a genetic disease they work with agriculture to create plants with new genes such as ones that resist draught some work in the law field using their genetics background to mold new laws regarding the production of genes a geneticist understands and works with genes but in what context he or she works with genes is able to be defined individually a student interested in genetics should consider taking biology and chemistry courses in high school in college it may be possible to major in genetics if a college or university does not offer genetics as a major a budding geneticist should consider biology biochemistry or chemistry as fields of study if research is in the future statistics is also an important course to take many geneticists go on to earn either a masters or doctorate in genetics though not all choose this course of action it is also possible to earn a dual mdphd for genetics allowing geneticists to do broader medical work according to healthcaresalariescom the average geneticist in the united states earns  per year however that number varies greatly among geneticists with

thats home thats us on it everyone you love everyone you know everyone you ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives”  do you ever look up at the night sky and wonder what happens beyond the confines of this planet astronomers and astrophysicists study the origins of the universe galaxies and stars they use modern technology to observe the billions of galaxies beyond the milky way and use this data to find new stars theoretical astronomers use advanced mathematics to mold theories surrounding the laws of the universe some of these theories such as albert einstein’s theory of general relativity end up impacting our lives in very real ways theoretical astronomers will usually find work in academia and will conduct research in their office experimental astronomers and astrophysicists can find work in academia as well but may also work for the government such as at the national aeronautics and space administration nasa or for private research institutions some astronomers have to work nontraditional hours as many will go to observatories at night to study the sky in more complete detail students considering astronomy and astrophysics should begin by taking physics and calculus in high school many colleges and universities offer undergraduate degrees in physics astrophysics and astronomy to do independent research a doctorate in one of these fields is also required astronomers and astrophysicists can expect to see job growth in the future it is expected that the demand for astronomers will grow by  percent from  to
