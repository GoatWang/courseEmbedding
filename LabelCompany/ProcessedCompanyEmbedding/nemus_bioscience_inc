camarketwired  jul    nemus bioscience inc otcqb nmus announced that data recently obtained from the companys research and development partner the university of mississippi um was accepted for presentation at the  annual meeting of the society of neuroscience held in washington dc on november thth the data being presented will show the superiority of the nemus proprietary analogue of cbd nb versus plantderived cbd in ameliorating pain in a validated mouse murine model of chemotherapyinduced peripheral neuropathy using an opioid as an active comparator additional data will also be presented detailing the antiaddictive potential of nb in an animal model of opioid addiction the in vivo research was led by professor kenneth sufka of the university of mississippi based on the molecular cannabinoid discovery work performed by the team at elsohly laboratories inc eli in collaboration with the university spearheaded by dr mahmoud elsohly who also holds a faculty appointment at the university nemus has previously reported that our proprietary analogue of cbd nb has exhibited a competitive bioavailability profile when compared to plantderived cbd penetrating the bloodbrain barrier to enter the central nervous system as well as all major organs especially the liver in animal studies conducted todate commented brian murphy md mba the nemus ceo and chief medical officer the data being presented by dr sufka is a pivotal start to developing the analogue of cbd to potentially address medical indications in multiple organ systems especially the eye brain and diseases of the liver dr kenneth sufka professor of psychology and pharmacology and research professor with the national center for natural products research at um stated we have been able to demonstrate that nb was able to deliver analgesia comparable to morphine which has been implicated in the current global opioid abuse epidemic the research team then moved to the next step using a validated animal model of addiction to opioids to assess the antiabuse potential of nb as a therapeutic we look forward to presenting the data this fall the discovery team is very pleased with the performance of this analogue of cbd in the studies that have been performed so far reported dr mahmoud elsohly professor at the national center for natural products research at the university of mississippi school of pharmacy and coinventor of the cbd analogue we believe that bioengineered cannabinoids offer a unique opportunity to potentially enhance the efficacy and safety profile of this class of therapeutics we look forward to working with nemus in advancing other cannabinoidbased therapies across a spectrum of diseases  dr murphy noted it appears that nb could have a number of uses beyond pain management and ocular conditions and moving forward nemus will consider strategic collaborations for this cbd analogue forward looking statements statements in this press release that are
