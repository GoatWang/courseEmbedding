natural gas precious and base metals ferrous and nonferrous metals and agriculture mr goehring and mr rozencwajg have a combined  years of resource investing experience and focus on taking large contrarian bets based on their investigation of market and commodity data they seek to use their data and related research to spot turning points that may not be widely appreciated by the market and uncover value when prices are depressed and investors are often bearish we believe that natural resources is a frequently misunderstood asset class that few investors have the expertise experience and patience to understand said mr goehring managing partner at gr associates adam and i love to explore significantly underappreciated trends that develop in global natural resources markets  trends that in our view often have huge investment implications our research projects often become odysseys in themselves but many times these journeys formulate fundamental opinions and investment ideas that we believe both investors and company management teams have come to rely on mr goehring and mr rozencwajg originally collaborated at chilton investment company where they managed upwards of  billion in assets within chiltons global natural resources strategy prior to chilton mr goehring served as the manager of the prudentialjennison family of natural resources funds managing over  billion at their

is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first
