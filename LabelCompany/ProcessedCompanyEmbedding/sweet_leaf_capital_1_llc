monitor and test the syrup at sweet trees island pond plant a young man stood expectantly in front of an evaporator his face illuminated by the orange glow coming from the steel contraption that boils maple sap down into syrup after checking and rechecking to see if the syrup was ready he opened a valve releasing a rush of sweetsmelling golden liquid into a container oh thats fancy he said with a wide grin that made his rosy cheeks look like apples another dude ran up in carhartts and a plaid shirt is it ready oh ho ho it is ready rosy cheeks just smiled their boss joe russo yelled from across the room is it ready its ready hollered rosy cheeks click to enlarge hannah palmer egan sweet trees island pond plant ok said russo approaching the evaporator he plunged a dipper into the cooling syrup swirled the pale amber liquid in the pan and brought it up to his face you dont even have to taste it he said breathing deeply you can smell it satisfied he handed the dipper to the guy in the plaid shirt who leaned in for a taste oh yeah he said smacking his lips after a sip the same giddiness overtakes vermont sugar makers every spring as the first sap turns to syrup but this particular scene played out not in some backyard sugar shack but in a factory where the human interaction was accompanied by the rhythmic clanking of machinery and the occasional hiss of steam exiting the labyrinthine system of plumbing and piping the evaporator alone cost a cool quarter million dollars — and its one of four inside the former ethan allen furniture plant in island pond once a symbol of local enterprise that plant now serves as the base of operations for connecticutbased sweet tree holdings  llc which bought the building last april for about  sweet tree is one of many assets held by wood creek capital management an investment arm of massachusetts mutual life insurance company in the last two years sweet tree has spent about  million to purchase  acres of remote maple forest in the northeast corner of vermonts northeast kingdom in the past several months workers installed  taps on a parcel in warrens gore when the spring sap run ends the company plans to add another  in averys gore according to wood creek managing director bob saul who is in charge of the sweet tree operation that would make it the largest single maple producer in the us — bigger than the current record holder green mountain mainlines in fletcher which drew sap from  taps last year according to the annual trade magazine the official united states maple syrup almanac vermont produces more maple syrup than any other us state — a quantity valued at  million in  click to enlarge hannah palmer egan sweet trees island pond plant facts are harder to come by about what sweet tree plans to do with the syrup it harvests no one — not saul or maple operation manager russo or sweet tree chief financial officer michael argyelan — will get specific except to say the syrup wont be sold locally or even necessarily in liquid form all three men said they intend to convert it into branded valueadded products which will be sold worldwide in highend markets some — perhaps all — of the manufacturing will take place onsite at the island pond plant its actually an aphrodisiac argyelan said jokingly of his plans for the raw maple when pressed the cfo who is a trained chemist said hes having products tested in south carolina a recent associated press story suggested the company could be brewing a fructosefree maple alternative to southern sweet tea probably in the next three or four months well know what were doing argyelan said right now everythings just going into drums until we decide how to use it not surprisingly this mega maple operation is the talk of the town — or more accurately of essex county i hear theyre putting in a million taps said a patron at chez pidgeon a friendly roadside watering hole on route  in norton they say they want to be the biggest maple producer in the world added another click to enlarge hannah palmer egan joe russo would that spell gloom or boom for vermonts indigenous maple producers which have traditionally been momandpop operations we were just talking about it actually said april lemay owner of aprils maple in canaan fifteen miles northeast of the sweet tree sugar bush she taps about  trees on land her family has sugared for generations our hope is that theyll educate a consumer market that wouldnt otherwise know about maple products in other words she hopes that sweet tree will grow the market not flood the existing one were not built to compete with somebody like that lemay said the market for us is very different its much more about local and the people passing through who buy into a small brand and buy into the business not into the conglomerate matt gordon executive director of the vermont maple sugar makers association said other producers share lemays concerns i think theres trepidation in the industry as a whole are we making too much syrup weve seen growth really take off in the last few years but history is full of examples of production rapidly growing and then things falling out modern maple the sweet tree maple property stretches for about three miles along route  north of island pond from the road passersby can see sap lines strung taut between the trees and a few shipping containers which serve as pump houses aside from these theres little indication of the operations industrial size here and there small roads lead into the maple bush which is scattered with yellow birch and softwood trees in midmarch the woods were still insulated with several feet of snow but at waist level a web of blue and white tubing connected the maples fanning out in every direction as far as the eye could see against the snow the trees and an ashen sky the blue sap lines looked electric standing in the middle of it is surreal but other than scale this operation is not unusual vermont maple is growing — and evolving — at an unprecedented pace click to enlarge hannah palmer egan sweet trees sugarbush in warrens gore according to henry marckres chief of consumer protection and maple specialist at the vermont agency of agriculture food  markets the number of maple taps throughout the state has grown by  percent in a single decade in  marckres said we estimated there were a million taps in vermont by  there were almost  million taps theres going to be over five million this year and the taps are more productive than ever before back in  the goal was to get a quart of syrup per tap said marckres now the goal is to get a half gallon per tap so youve got five times the number of taps and twice the production per tap the difference is technology this is not your grandpappys horsedrawn sapbucket operation todays taps are smaller than the old ones but the plastic lines that replaced the oldschool buckets now connect to vacuumpowered pumps that pull the juice from the tree hardly anybody collects sap with buckets now said tim wilmot extension maple specialist at the university of vermonts proctor maple research center you just cannot get a decent amount of sap without the vacuum wilmot said most large operations also preprocess the sap in reverseosmosis machines which remove up to  percent of the water the concentrated liquid takes less time and fuel to evaporate with the increased efficiency sugar makers can tap bigger tracts of land every drop of the worlds maple syrup supply comes from hardwoods in a narrow swath of north america extending from the great lakes to the canadian maritimes but according to gordon only a tiny fraction of the trees in those areas have been tapped in vermont its roughly  percent and thats a high percentage compared to new york or michigan or elsewhere he said so the growth could be phenomenal but were not sure if we can grow the market in proportion  so we dont create an oversupply click to enlarge hannah palmer egan joe russo in the sweet tree boiler room so far consumer demand has grown apace with increasing supply and the price of the product has remained relatively stable syrup currently sells for around  per gallon wholesale and retails for a lucrative  québec and the mapleproducing new england states recently agreed to standardize the qualitycontrol process which forced vermont to adopt a wordier system of grading syrup fancy is now grade a golden color with delicate taste grade b is grade a dark with robust taste economic logic suggests that if there were a way to increase demand for syrup the price would hold steady or even rise but historically the state of vermont has had limited success in marketing liquid maple to cultures that dont eat pancakes or french toast and while vermont families may consume maple by the gallon the average per capita annual consumption in the united states hovers around a measly three ounces — roughly a quarter of a cup tapping into new overseas markets and rolling out valueadded products that position maple as a healthy natural alternative to refined sweeteners could be two ways to grow international demand another factor that could drive up the price of syrup is climate change which is pushing the maple band farther north maple producers in vermont are already seeing the effects on average sugaring now begins eight days earlier and ends  days sooner than it did  years ago all it takes is a freak warm spell in march or april to bring the sugaring season to an abrupt halt from a us investors point of view the coldest highest locations in vermonts northeast corner may look like some of the last sweet spots to maximize its potential its sugarmaple carnage down here saul said of southern new england where the freezethaw cycle can cause the trees to crack he explained exposing them to blights and insect hazards that hasnt been an issue in frigid essex county where the winters remain reliably cold forest assets sweet tree is not alone in its quest to make money from maple but its not every day that an outofstate company snaps up large tracts of vermont land hires dozens of people and taps  trees in its first season it certainly seems like its a first — for vermont and probably for maple syrup said gordon its also the first fromscratch maple operation to commodify syrup not as an end in itself but as part of an investment portfolio wood creek capital and ultimately massmutual bank on longterm predictable returns sweet tree is betting as much on vermonts value as a lifestyle brand as it is on the maple syrup itself saul said we chose vermont because its prebranded he said thank you very much state of vermont for having the best brand of any state click to enlarge hannah palmer egan unfiltered syrup from the march  boil and in an increasingly foodobsessed world the asset manager sees maple as a resource on the rise its becoming an ingredient in more and more products saul said its gaining more of a purchase on the public and foodconsuming publics mental state  every cooking show has some maple component sweettoothed consumers can now buy everything from bourbon to energy goo made with the stuff the skiracing cochran family recently started selling a version of the latter called untapped from their slopeside syrup store in richmond — and at burlingtons outdoor gear exchange last week the ukbased guardian ran a story about the product headlined is maple syrup the new athletic superfuel maple is also gaining ground in previously unexplored markets you have this global awakening going on saul said theres a lot of syrup being sold in japan in saudi arabia in europe gordon confirmed anecdotal evidence from local maple exporters of growing interest in japan and china also in oceania australia and new zealand europe isnt growing quite as fast he said vermont is well equipped to supply that international demand and many of its most productive maple forests are located in the northern counties woodlands cover most of the northeast kingdom and thats particularly true in essex county which is home to around  fulltime residents — fewer than  people per square mile here land is often traded among timber companies in thousandacre plots and much of it is conserved in perpetuity under the forest legacy program such lands are privately owned but subject to oversight from the department of forests parks and recreation they can be used for forestry agriculture or recreation but never developed click to enlarge hannah palmer egan sweet tree workers in front of the evaporator sweet trees properties in warrens and averys gores are legacy lands previously used for timber harvest to put the land into current use as a sugar bush — and enjoy the significant tax savings that come with keeping the land undeveloped — sweet tree must create a longterm forest management plan that complies with the forestry departments guidelines with changes sweeping the maple industry vermont forestry commissioner michael snyder said hes had to reconsider how maple forests are managed with input from the maple community he recently modernized the current use framework for sugar bushes monitored by the forestry department to encourage longterm forest viability clearing out everything but the maple trees for example is not permitted and understory flora and debris must be left to decompose the new guidelines snyder hopes will help preserve maple as a vermont product we have a shared interest in the health of the land and the sustainability of this really awesome product which is a hallmark of vermont we need to take care of the forests so they can continue to provide sap and continue to provide forest even if all you care about is sap snyder added its in your interest to protect forest health we want people to find new ways to make money from the land but we want to make sure we get it right so far snyder said hes optimistic that the sweet tree properties are in good hands i think theyre paying attention and doing a good job i havent done a lot of inspecting out there personally but my sense of it is its off to a good start director saul has been managing longterm woodland investments since the s and lives on  acres of farmland in western massachusetts maple operation manager russo runs his own sugar bush in belvidere —  taps strong — and has been boiling maple for nearly five decades the two have hired a couple of dozen experienced local woodsmen to handle the tapping operation snyder conceded that maintaining open public recreational access which is required by the legacy easement could be a struggle im kind of curious how people who want to travel across the land hiking hunting skiing — whatever it is — how are they going to experience this he said referring to the network of blue tap lines that snakes through the sweet tree sugar bush even with his extensive maple and forestry background snyder said those lines still take him aback when i see all this plastic this wall of tubing along  it takes my breath away then i think actually this is good this is very near and dear to me the commissioner said — referring to the working landscape as a whole these trees provide the scenic backdrop to the community — the natural infrastructure for recreation and clean air and water but nobody pays for these things timber and sap are the only things that pay their way these other things are wonderful and they have real value to vermont but theyre not bringing landowners any money native economy when ethan allen global left island pond in  it took more than  jobs with it the connecticutbased furniture chain still has a manufacturing plant in nearby orleans — its named after a green mountain hero after all plans to put a woodpellet plant in the old factory fell through years ago but when wood creek bought the property in  it inherited a ready stream of qualified workers — people with exceptional work ethic who are anxious to work hard and who want to work outdoors as saul put it as an asset manager he specializes in agriculture and forestbased investments which often require physical labor performed outdoors finding folks who are willing to do that kind of work can be a challenge elsewhere in the country thats not the case in island pond at the moment sweet tree employs  fulltime workers saul said he plans to hire up to  more this summer once tree tapping starts up again the company ran helpwanted ads in the local papers but saul said most of his employees came in through word of mouth — and people are still stopping by the former ethan allen plant looking for work in a conversation in february brighton town administrator joel cope said that despite lingering unease about industrial maple in the community it may be a good match for island pond a town he describes as hard up for business were not in line for clean electronics factories or anything like that said cope this fits we have wood now that the operations up and running some skeptics seem to be embracing the economic boost ive gotta be honest im not against it im just concerned said one local sipping a whiskey with water at chez pidgeon last tuesday but it has brought a lot of employment to people in this area that have been starving since ethan allen — i mean its not totally gone but theres not much left around here anymore even small producer lemay said she welcomes the big company it brings jobs to the area which is wonderful i know a lot of the guys that work there for someone whos part of a small community — and trying to create jobs  its good to see that type of economic development people are definitely watching sweet tree — and not just in investment circles its early in the game said snyder noting that the company has barely even started its first sap run the commissioner may not have fully inspected the operation but its definitely on his radar i spend a lot of my time up there he said so i have an eye on it will big maple be a safer bet than a fickle furniture brand that evokes a vermont patriot who was born in connecticut future sugaring seasons will tell until nature
