investing in closedend investment companies involves risk including the possible loss of principal diversification may not protect against market risk fixed income securities and bond funds can lose value and investors can lose principal as interest rates rise they also may be affected by economic conditions that hinder an issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments on its debt the fund may also be subject to prepayment risk the risk that the principal of a bond that is held by a portfolio will be prepaid prior to maturity at the time when interest rates are lower than what the bond was paying a portfolio may then have to reinvest that money at a lower interest rate high yielding noninvestmentgrade bonds junk bonds involve higher risk than investment grade bonds narrowly focused investments may exhibit higher volatility than investments in multiple industry sectors reit investments are subject to many of the risks associated with direct real estate ownership including changes in economic conditions credit risk and interest rate fluctuations the funds may invest in derivatives which may involve additional expenses and are subject to risk including the risk that an underlying security or securities index moves in the opposite direction from what the portfolio manager anticipated a derivatives transaction depends upon the counterparties’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations international investments entail risks not ordinarily associated with us investments including fluctuation in currency values differences in accounting principles or economic or political instability in other nations investing in emerging markets can be riskier than investing in established foreign markets due to increased volatility and lower trading volume if and when the fund invests in forward foreign currency contracts or uses other investments to hedge against currency risks the fund will be subject to special risks including counterparty risk the fund may experience portfolio turnover that approaches or exceeds  which could result in higher transaction costs and tax liability nav market price and premium or discount will fluctuate with changes in market conditions at the time of sale your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment market price is the price an investor would pay for shares of a fund on the secondary market market price shown is the market closing price as of the previous business day net asset value nav is the total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding premiumdiscount is the amount by which the market price trades above or below the nav if and when the fund utilizes leverage the fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other distributions with respect to its common shares or purchase its capital stock unless the fund meets certain asset coverage requirements to the extent the fund engages in option overwriting it may receive less total return in certain periods and in other periods greater total return from its option overwriting strategy the use of dividend capture strategies will expose the fund to increased trading costs and potential for capital loss or gain particularly in the event of significant shortterm price movements of stocks subject to dividend capture trading and resultant dividends may not be qualified dividends eligible to individuals for reduced federal income tax rates closedend funds unlike openend funds are not continuously offered after being issued during a onetimeonly public offering shares of closedend funds are sold in the open market through a securities exchange net asset value nav is calculated by subtracting total liabilities by total assets then dividing by the number of shares outstanding at the time of sale your shares may have a market price that is above or below nav and may be worth more or less than your original investment the fund may make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields there is no assurance that a fund will
