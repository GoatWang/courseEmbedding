august   stanford internship post placement week  post placement week  promptreflection how did it all go which of your five strengths strengths finders was most helpful to you over the summer what do you know now that you wish you knew at the beginning of the summer what advice would you like to share with next year’s intern although i believe all of my strengths played a key role in my success this summer i would have to say harmony was most crucial the most rewarding part of my experience was the opportunity to connect with student affairs professionals as well as other faculty and staff over the  weeks i was on campus i met with many folks in one on one meetings over coffee or lunch in formal settings such as planning meetings and informally when my supervisor would walk me around and introduce me to people i believe my ability to coexist with people of different backgrounds and interests is helpful for me when making new interpersonal connections i get anxious in typical networking settings and forced interactions but with my supervisor being incredibly helpful in bridging connections and assisting me with initial introductions the time i spent with everyone felt very natural and i learned so much from their stories  i feel extremely fortunate to have worked with stanford this summer and it all worked out but i would definitely have approached my search differently now knowing what i know as a graduate searching for a greek specific internship there isnt a whole lot of support in this area with the internship systems that achuo and noda provide i was under the impression that they only offered housing and orientation internships which isnt true i signed up for noda which gave me access to s of internships in orientation but my lack of experience in orientation resulted in only one call i approached the orientation search because i wanted a new experience but the schools i applied to wanted someone with experience that would make an immediate impact i would advise future grads to focus on their transferrable skills in answering the application questions opposed to approaching the application seeking a new experience i think that limited the calls i got back from noda specific internships i have the skills to be an asset to an orientation program but in retrospect i didnt treat the internship search like a job search as i should have if that makes sense i didnt sign up through achuo at all and that was a big mistake on my end further advice to grads would be to give yourself as many options as you can some in my cohort struggled to find opportunities myself included and not exploring all of my options didnt help me  some further advice i would share would be to make an effort to connect with the other gradsinterns on campus there were about  acuho interns i possibly could have been one of them had i signed up for acuho and because i was in the same department as them it took a while for me to connect with them and even longer for me to feel comfortable in their group because they work together everyday eventually i did feel comfortable and that was because i put myself out there and spent more time with them i made some great friends there at the end and i even told them before i left that my biggest regret from my time at stanford was not making more of an effort to hang out with them early on i was sad to leave them all at the end because they were great people and will be my future colleagues for your own sanity being in a new place where you dont know anyone and so you can make some connects with grads with similar struggles as you hang out with the interns if there are any  posted by michael eberhard at  am  comment email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest older
