services for physicians and their patients a number of factors affect our competitive position including  number quality and specialties of physicians nurses and other healthcare professionals  the scope breadth and quality of services  reputation  managed care contracting relationships  physical condition of facilities and medical equipment  location  availability of parking or proximity to public transportation  charges for services and  ability to form local hospital networks we currently face competition from established notforprofit healthcare corporations investorowned hospital corporations large tertiary care centers and outpatient service providers in the future we expect to encounter increased competition from companies like ours that consolidate hospitals and healthcare companies in specific geographic markets continued consolidation in the healthcare industry will be a leading contributing factor to increased competition in markets in which we already have a presence and in markets we may enter in the future another factor in the competitive position of a hospital is the ability of its management to negotiate contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services the importance of obtaining managed care contracts has increased in recent years and is expected to continue to increase as private and government payors and others turn to managed care organizations to help control rising healthcare costs our markets have experienced significant managed care penetration the revenue and operating results of our hospitals are significantly affected by our hospitals ability to negotiate favorable contracts with managed care plans health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations use managed care contracts to direct patients to and manage the use of hospital services in exchange for discounts from the hospitals established charges traditional health insurers also are interested in containing costs through similar contracts with hospitals an additional competitive factor is whether a hospital is part of a local hospital network and the scope and quality of services offered by the network and by competing networks a hospital that is part of a network that offers a broad range of services in a wide geographic area is more likely to obtain more favorable managed care contracts than a hospital that is not we intend to evaluate changing circumstances in each geographic area in which we operate on an ongoing basis and to position ourselves to compete in these managed care markets by forming our own or joining with others to form local hospital networks company description industry overview the us health care financing administration estimated that in  total annual us healthcare expenditures grew by  to  trillion it projects that total us healthcare spending will grow by  annually from  through  by these estimates healthcare expenditures will account for approximately  trillion or  of the total us gross domestic product by  hospital services represents the largest segment of the healthcare industry accounting for  of total healthcare expenditures in  or  billion the us health care financing administration projects the hospital services category to grow by  per year through  it expects growth in hospital spending to continue due to the aging of the us population and consumer demand for expanded medical services according to the american hospital association there are over  hospitals in the united states of which approximately  are owned by notforprofit and government entities the us hospital industry is broadly defined to include acute care rehabilitation and psychiatric facilities that are either public government owned and operated notforprofit private religious or secular or forprofit institutions investor owned these facilities offer a broad range of healthcare services including internal medicine general surgery cardiology oncology neurosurgery orthopedics obstetrics and gynecology and emergency services in addition hospitals also offer other ancillary services including psychiatric diagnostic rehabilitation home health and outpatient surgery services hospital industry trends demographic trends according to the us census bureau there are approximately  million americans aged  or older in the united states today who comprise approximately  of the total us population by the year  the number of elderly persons is expected to climb to  million or  of the total population due to the increasing life expectancy of americans the number of people aged  years and older is also expected to increase from  million to  million by the year  this increase in life expectancy will increase demand for healthcare services and as importantly the demand for innovative more sophisticated means of delivering those services hospitals as the largest category of care in the healthcare market will be among the main beneficiaries of this increase in demand consolidation during the late s and early s there was significant industry consolidation involving large investorowned hospital companies seeking to achieve economies of scale while consolidation activity in the hospital industry is continuing this consolidation is primarily taking place through mergers and acquisitions involving notforprofit hospital systems reasons for this activity include  limited access to capital  financial performance issues including challenges associated with changes in reimbursement  the desire to enhance the local availability of healthcare in the community  the need and ability to recruit primary care physicians and specialists and  the need to achieve general economies of scale and to gain access to standardized and centralized functions including favorable supply agreements shifting utilization trends over the past decade many procedures that had previously required hospital visits with overnight stays have been performed on an outpatient basis this shift has been driven by cost containment efforts led by private and government payors the focus on cost containment has coincided with advancements in medical technology that have allowed patients to be treated with less invasive procedures that do not require overnight stays according to the american hospital association the number of surgeries performed on an inpatient basis declined from  to  at an average annual rate of  from  million in  to  million in  during the same period the number of outpatient surgeries increased at an average annual rate of  from  million in  to  million in  the mix of inpatient as compared to outpatient surgeries shifted from a ratio of  inpatient to  outpatient in  to a ratio of  inpatient to  outpatient in  these trends have led to a reduction in the average length of stay and as a result inpatient utilization rates according to the american hospital association the average length of stay in hospitals has declined from  days in  to  days in  company

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
