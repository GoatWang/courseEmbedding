branchcircuit load faults from the supply source the fdp is available for singlephase and threephase input voltages and can accomodate single double or three pole switches up to  pole positions per unit or more by special order each branch switch output feeds a highspeed subcycle clearing fuse which in turn feeds the load the vti fused distribution panel is supplied with ul or cul labels they

including pricing registration for this service is easy and free find out more applications fuse circuit breaker and ups coordination curve click for detail closeup of ul a v fuse holder with nec midget semiconductor protection type fuse available from  to  amps typical applications include power distribution from an uninterruptable power supply where standard thermomagnetic breakers are too slow to coordinate with the automatic transfer bypass circuit in a ups during a branch circuit fault the ups transfers back to the utility source to clear the fault after the fault is cleared the ups transfers back to the ups output this transfer takes place because the ups has limited short circuit capacity and cannot produce enough short circuit current to cause an ordinary branch breaker to reach its instantaneous trip level on occasion you can drop the load during the transfer cycle or worse case have the ups transfer to the utility voltage source that is not there the solution is to incorporate the fused distribution panel fdp into your system network select the proper highspeed fuse with appropriate clearing time curve and current rating from a to a the fdp is also useful for power distrubution to multiple small electrical loads such as electronic instruments where fuses can be sized down to amps for precise load protection for sensitive instruments this offers an advantage over a standard panelboard where the smallest breaker is  amps the fdpdc is also available for dc power applications features enclosure industrial grade gauge steel with gray enamel finish
