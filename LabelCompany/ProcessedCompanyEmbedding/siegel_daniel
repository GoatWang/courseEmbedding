too small walls already covered by bookshelves full to overflowing i finally had to admit it was time to make friends with borrowing books from the excellent cincinnati library system every once in a while that simply will not do this book has become one of those oncesim dying to have my very own copy on the shelves of my personal library so that i can highlight passages and make notes in the margin to my hearts content i knew within the first chapter that this was a book i would be quoting and recommending to students and clients until my newly ordered book arrives however that library book goes nowherethose who are familiar with seigel know already that the books title refers to his lifelong fascination with the distinction between mind and brain reading some of the other reviews will allow those of you who are not already familiar with his work to understand that while he certainly is an advocate of the use of mindfulness practices this is not intended to be a book about mindfulness despite what the publishers blurb might suggest nor is it a how to book if that is what you are looking for this is not your book likewise if you have a library full of neuropsych neurolinguistic and psychosocial tomes you will probably be happier with one of his other more expensive booksfor the rest of you  this book is already on its way to becoming a classic it is an easytocomprehend plainlanguage explantation of how biology intellect and emotions combine with conscious and unconcious brain processes to create our experience of life and living his points are illustrated through and anchored by case studies and personal experiencesto quote another reviewer if you understand what is going on internally within you often embedded in your subconscious from previous traumatic events you can overcome it with mindsight so instead of reacting like an animal when someone enrages you you exercise mindsight and utilise your executive control     rising above the autoresponse     using neuroscience to help you have an insight into your mind when emotions overtake youthat id like to add reframes your experience of the event  part of the process of neuroplasticity changing the very structure of your brain  which ultimately transforms your experience of livingwhile seigel is certainly not the only author or scientist to link brain body and mind the way in which he puts it all together and connects it to therapy is uniquely his own contribution and of significant merit for my money this book comes about as close as it is possible to get attempting to condense a lifes work into a single book written to be useful to the general public  the many of us who dont have advanced degrees in the neurofields or the time to keep up with the latest research on oligodendrocytes and schwann cellsfor what its worth it definitely made the shortlist of required resources for my upcoming brainbased coach training curriculummadelyn

paperbackverified purchasethe scope of this book has an unusual largeness it rattles my own basic ideas about psychology and it also takes what had been favorite ideas of mine and sets them in a new terrain favorite ideas that changed my life include the carl rogers idea about attunements role in healing read in  alan wattss idea about being the observer at the bottom of the sea watching your mental waves at the surface  christine downings and david lmillers  barry magids and pema chodrons  ideas about complexity about conflictual aspects of our triune brain and about accepting my shadowy parts and others with love i look back at those ideamilestones with a new understanding given the new neuroscience each idea is here in dr siegels book with a more welldefined backdrop in the mindthe book synthesizes a lot of new research and inventively applies that very practically to how we can more effectively heal it is complex addressing several aspects of our minds from different angles combining many disciplines linking differentiated languages into a new languageif that sounds overwhelming it was for me but it is also very personal with the stories of dr siegel and his patients and others being a main vehicle of expression and it is very enjoyable to read there is a heart of compassion and humanity at the center of the book and the concept of mindsighti see myself and relationships utterly differently i see how utterly dependent we are on each other and our cultures for our own mental health integration and our own physical health and for being able to express our potential in this world our brains cant develop in a vacuum and only develop to reflect the quality of our relationships but the flip side is that it is possible to resculpt the brain in positive directions in a therapeutic relationship and in our relationships with ourselves and othersi also see from the chapter on a couples therapy that a crucial element of healing is to see your own and in this chapter especially others minds from a place of curiosity openness and acceptance to respect each others developmental history and how it has shaped each others minds i particularly feel this call for respect in how i have thought of my childhood and ancestral heritage and the diagnostic labels that have helped me to make sense of it a piece that i can see differently is that infantile rage provoked by brakes and accelerator at the same time an ancestral heritage is something stuck in the brain and it can be unstuck but especially that it can be seen for what it is without letting it cloud and muddy ones compassion toward family the two can be separatedi myself am struggling to heal from ptsd and severe environmental sensitivities i feel more hope with these new mindsight approaches a common theme across chapters is healing the implicit patterns from childhood unconsciously driving our lives so that we can become authors of our own story as we come more into the present and move into our future that said i also have financial obstacles to getting access to these treatments i aspire to reach the transpirational part of my journey p  an expansion of our care and concern beyond ourselves and our immediate relationships to identify with the world and its inhabitants at large and seek their wellbeing  a natural incidental part of developing mindsight and integrating the disconnections in our brainsin the meantime i have turned a corner in developing my own mindsight with dr siegels books building on graduate school jungian therapy meditation and aca turning this corner has made so much difference in the daytoday momenttomoment quality of my life i had devised a new meditation based on dr siegels with coauthors  books on parenting before i read mindsight now i see that my  phrases are very related to mindsight and i want to share them because they have meant so much to me on my journey i use them frequently like a lovingkindness practicei have a tender open heart to my current experiencei am aware and accepting of my current experiencei an relaxed and soft in my body as i hold my current experiencei am quiet and calm as i keep company with my current experiencedeveloping mindsight can give us access to the receptive self p an inner sanctuaryopen to what is ready to receive whatever arrives at the door inviting all aspects of oneself into the shelter of ones receptive mind p another viewaltering insight i had is that while i myself am aware of at least  traumatic adulthood events that may have given rise to my ptsd i would need to track the body sensations and images of my traumaactivated episodes with an emotionally safe specialist to find the actual moments in time where the situations overwhelmed me i dont have any explicit memories of where the implicit trauma sensations are arising from when i experience my almostdaily episodes when we discovered the actual moments then i would have to reexperience the actual moments with the specialist and with a dual focus one foot in the past one foot in the present and connect them into a narrative and integrate them into explicit memory after all these years of my studying ptsd dr siegels understanding of the brain finally got that missing piece through to me the implicit sensations are coming from specific moments of my past that i cannot as yet pinpointi think psychoanalytic theories will have to keep evolving themselves to match the new neuroscience thankfully there are people like dr siegel with the passion and ability and fortitude to synthesize large amounts of new research information and translate that into paradigmaltering new forms of more understandable and more effective psychotherapy i know many are devoting their lives to this project and its exciting to be a part of it dr siegels work is a very big gift to me and us comments  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product

there was a problem loading comments right now please try again later out of  starsbrain science for use with social sciences and arts toobyfred cheyunskion december  format paperbackverified purchasedaniel siegel’s “mindsight” is a very good book as confirmed by its many reviews that provides most recent brain science applied for personal and interpersonal concerns that can also be helpful in illuminating social science as well as artistic and literary mattersi came upon mention of this book while reading “the end of stress four steps to rewire your brain” by don joseph goewey which employs many of siegel’s ideas as they can be useful to those involved in business and other stressful situations my interest included learning more about the new developments in neuroscience mental health and their implications for human potential as wellthe book does not disappoint part i with chapters  explains the most recent research and the way siegel has incorporated these findings in developing his “mindsight” approach to facilitating insight into the workings of the brain mind and relationships part ii with chapters  utilizes therapeutic cases to illustrate and delve further into “mindsight” in action and the power to changemy favorite parts included those about the triangle of well bring mind brain and relationships the hand model of the brain and brain diagrams i enjoyed phrasing such as “what fires together wires together” regarding neurons energy and information flow as well as “name it to tame it” regarding harnessing our emotions other aspects such as the mind as a regulatory process the quest for integration including reconciling personal narratives or stories of our lives were also meaningful for me on page  siegel mentions the poet’s gift for translating feelings into words and mastery of such neural skill in dealing with the ongoing challenge to accurately depict our internal worldin the foreword daniel goleman author of “emotional intelligence” indicates that just as freud’s theory of the unconscious also jung’s collective unconscious darwin’s model of evolution continues to help us understand the current research into human behavior daniel siegel’s theory of mindsight offers similar opportunities to enlighten during my reading it seemed that siegel’s approach has the potential to help provide enhanced interpretations for other criticism and social commentaryfor instance with siegel’s emphasis on integration as the key to health and wellbeing what might be a revision of territory covered in daniel h pink’s “a whole new mind why rightbrainers will rule the future” or perhaps how could one extend the recently republished marshall mcluhan article on the brain and the media that appears in “on the nature of media essays ” in this regard works like valerie porr’s excellent “overcoming borderline personality disorder” which goes in depth on one condition mentioned in siegel’s book suggests some possibilities emphasizing similar neurobiology and dialectic behavior therapies she indicates the pursuit of “wise mind” which combines “emotional mind” and “logical mind” as an effective synthesisso to begin to understand the new brain science its current and potential uses take a look at “mindsight”comment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product

book is embodied in a quote by martin luther king jr from the letter from birmingham jail we are caught in the inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny whatever affects one directly affects us all indirectly professor and psychiatrist dan siegel illustrates king’s words in action he explains how mindsight helps us integrate and regulate the flow of energy and information both within ourselves and among others while at the same time honoring differences and reshaping our own brains the brain is a social organ and mindsight is about regulating and integrating emotional and social intelligence indeed knowing ourselves and sensing the inner world of others is uniquely human through mindful breathing and reflection we can learn to “name and tame” our emotions rather than being consumed by and “becoming” those emotions he proposes a triangle wellbeing  mind  brain  relationshipscomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport

wellbeingbyrobert morrishall of fametop  reviewervine voiceon october  format paperbackverified purchasein shakespeares play hamlet polonius offers this advice to his son alerts before his departure for collegethis above all to thine own self be trueand it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any manurging the young man to be true to himself is sound advice but presupposes that laertes knows who he is for most of us selfknowledge is immensely difficult to obtain and even more difficult to accept however socrates insists that the unexamined life is not worth living all this is relevant to daniel siegels latest book mindsight in which he discusses the core principles and potential significance of the new science of personal transformation a process during which the brain creates itself or increases its capabilities to promote physical psychological and interpersonal wellbeingas daniel goleman correctly observes in an uncommonly enlightening foreword daniel siegels theory of mindsight  the brains capacity for both insight and empathymakes sense for us out of the cluttered confusions of our sometimes maddening and messy emotionsselfawareness and empathy are along with selfmastery and social skills domains of human ability essential for success in lifeof these four skills selfawareness lays the foundation for the restthere are several concepts or themes central to siegels narrative for example the triangle of wellbeing reveals three aspects of our lives ie relationships mind and brain that form the three mutual influencing points of the triangle of wellbring mindsight enables us to become aware of indeed monitor and modify the flow of energy and information within the triangle of wellbeing two others are a window of tolerance see pages  and  and the wheel of awareness  and  siegel explains why goleman is deadon selfawareness lays the foundation for the rest that is not to suggest however that ones selfawareness must be total before the expanded and enlightened mindsight can be applied there are several reasons why i think this is so here are the two i think are most important first all human beings change for better or worse as does the potential selfknowledge to be obtained the process of selfexamination to which socrates refers is endless until death my second reason is that over time during our personal transformation others will interact with us differently as will we with them and adjustments must be made thereby increasing the number and quality of opportunities for gaining new valuable insights about ourselves of course but also about human naturethese are among the dozens of passages that caught my eyeo hand model of the brain pages o the mechanism of mindlessness o what fires together wires together o a healthy mind complexity and selforganization o a mindful approach to changing the mind o awareness training and stabilizing the mind o building inner resources o patterns of attachment o an unresolved and disorganized mind o topdown and bottomup o making sense of the past to free the present then in the appendix i especially appreciate the provision of a dozen basic concepts and related terms and ideas that form a foundation for our approach of mindsight integration and wellbeing  followed by extensively annotated notes  when review key points later i would begin with these two sectionsno brief commentary such as mind can possibly do full justice to the scope and depth of material that siegel provides in this volume i conclude with three points that are of special importance to me and will be perhaps to many others who read this brilliant book first our mind is what the brain does and the brain viewed as a muscle can be expanded and strengthened with that process limited only by the nature and extent of our commitment to it second the material siegel provides has compelling and substantial importance to improving child development within and beyond their schools finally i agree with daniel siegel that mindsight can allow us to see the internal workings of our own minds to be sure but it can also help us to increase our understanding and appreciation others and  through meaningful interaction with them  increase their understanding and appreciation of us that is indeed a compelling visioncomment  people found this helpful was this

bymatthew a ferrarion july  format paperbackverified purchasei so badly want to like dr siegels work this is the rd book of his ive attempted to read for the most part i agree with the basic philosophical orientation and commitments that guide his writing and the territory he keeps writing into from different angles basically the minds significance and its connection to human wellbeing is relevant and important with this being said i dont know how his books get published as they are absolutely painful to read what i dont understand is that you can hire an editor to proof your work and help you organize and clarify your writing for a fair price all three of his works that ive read suffer from the same basic stylistic writing deficiencies redundancy i could easily condense all three books that ive read into less than one book oddinaccessibly turn of phrase and most of all an absolutely dreadful lack of sustained conceptual focus clarity and organization the biggest tragedy in my opinion is that because of his unresolved stylistic issues the core ideas of his books remain inaccessible its like trying to walk somewhere beautiful with a map thats indirect at best and utterly incomprehensible at worsthonestly just read the summaries of his books or any reviews of them online and youll have basically  of the book save yourself the commentwas this review helpful to

starsmindsightbysteven m savlovon april  format mp cdverified purchasei have read several other books authored by dr siegel including the developing mind the mindful mind and recently read mindsight as a neuropsychologist and clinical psychologist i found the previous two books as well as mindsight to be excellent in terms of bringing neuroscience and psychotherapy together in a very humanistic and readable manner many books about neuroscience are very technical and dry when it comes to practical application of science and theory dr siegels presentation in mindsight is very readable and practical with lots of wonderful examples of his thinking and the science behind his approach to psychotherapy which lets the reader adopt or adapt many of his strategies into their practice or their lives very easily even after  years of clinical practice i have found that dr siegels approach has had a significant influence on how i conceptualize and understand my patients i would highly recommend mindsight to my colleagues and to my patients as i feel it would be very meaningful and useful to bothcomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport
