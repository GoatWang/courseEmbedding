am est my big thing which i think a lot about irrespective of this election is us competitiveness in the world in this global environment its a little bit related to my background i am european and i have traveled a lot in asia and i am living here i am looking at what has happened over the last number of years and im very concerned im very concerned with americas position in the global competitive environment if you sit where i sit as the ceo of a global company thermo fisher scientific with  employees we manufacture in  countries around the world every time we make an investment decision we basically have a choice to make it in any country we want to make it if we build a new factory we can go anywhere we want if we want to create a big new push on rd in a certain technology area we can essentially do it in any country we want what ive found in the last  to  years is my own desire to do it in the us has gradually eroded it has to do with a number of things one talent—it is becoming harder and harder to get good technical people that goes back to what is happening in schools right now it also has to do with the environment toward large corporations corporate taxes here are some of the highest of any country in the world labor availability and labor issues are a problem not so much in the us yet but i worry about the future there are certain european countries—the one with the really good cheese comes to mind its just really hard for the ceo of a global company to now say im going to build a new factory in france and im going to hire  people because if you do and you may want to adjust the workforce—you have no flexibility its tremendously expensive to do anything in terms of adjusting your workforce up or down were going to see more of that in the us as well so corporate taxes labor relations and availability of technical talent are issues that are becoming more and more urgent as we move into the next decade education its an issue in general that the quality in public schools k through  has eroded its particularly true for math and science education where a lot of children at the middleschool age really need to—if theyre going to become scientists or engineers—pick up that interest at that particular time there are very few dedicated teachers in public middle schools that can teach those subjects in an interesting way you lose them before they even turn  years old we are now in international testing of high school students th in science and th in math that is a horrendous rating our manufacturing capability is eroding so we must win in the area of high technology and highlevel services if we dont have the future workforce to enable that its going to be very hard immigration after  weve made it harder for foreigners to come and study here to get visas so theres no longer a pool of foreigners who can take over certain gaps in this respect many chinese students now dont bother to come to the us theyre just going to create education in china and china is now producing four times as many engineers as the us at the moment the next government needs to take a hard look at that and spend serious time figuring out how we can improve math and science education in the public schools in particular taxes we have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world thats probably not going to improve—it might get worse in the future there are some things that a new government could do one would be to declare a tax holiday on repatriated cash that a lot of international companies have overseas we have almost half of our cash outside of this country tied up outside of this country because there is a tax penalty when you bring it back there is some temporary relief now as a result of the financial crisis but in the end to me as a longterm policy it doesnt make sense not to allow us to bring that money back if we cant bring it back we wont invest it here well invest it somewhere else only when you allow it to be brought back in a taxefficient way is there a chance we would spend it in the us tax incentives for companies to put new factories in the us combined with a bettereducated workforce longterm is the way to prevent outsourcing worries from the financial crisis the most important business stories of the day get bloombergs daily newsletter sign up you read about all of the problems going on and you wonder where is the money going to come from for all of this if we have to bail out banks the money you could spend on education on environmental protection on new energy sources on all of this stuff health care that we really need to do now were using to keep banks afloat that made a bunch of bad loans the bad loans gave us a standard of living in the past that were going to pay for in the future it is paying for past sins that will make it harder for us to invest in the future at a time when we really need it thats a challenge for any government return to the obama election  table of contents
