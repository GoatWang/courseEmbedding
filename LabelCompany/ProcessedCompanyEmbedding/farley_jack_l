industries john purswell jr left with his two sons for a soccer game on saturday morning may  praise the lord that john had let his son drive that morning while they were still close to baytown john groaned a few times and slumped over without saying a word austin his oldest son recognized that something was wrong and turned and immediately went as rapidly as possible to the nearest hospital he reached the hospital in about five minutes and rallied the emergency room personnel and they began working on john even before he was taken from the truck they worked for more than  minutes to reestablish a rhythmic heart beat and finally succeeded but the damage was already done john succumbed to the damage done in that  to  minutes to many of his organs the following saturday may  john was  years old with a wife and three childrenthe reason i write this is that i can only assume a couple of things that we were never able to discuss one is that i have learned that all heart attacks are not created equal some people are blessed to survive an attack as i was with a few stints and go back to a reasonably normal life however in the part of the heart that was affected with john jr his heart went into ventricular fibrillation according to the cardiologist when that happens the heart just stops pumpingthe cardiologist told me you have a maximum of four to six minutes to restore circulation or your chances of ever knowing who you are again are extremely remote yes there are exceptions and that is what we were all praying for but sometimes that is not part of gods plan the lesson to be learned is dont ignore your bodys warnings signs until it is convenient to have them checked out if you are having chest pains go to the emergency room immediately you may not have a
