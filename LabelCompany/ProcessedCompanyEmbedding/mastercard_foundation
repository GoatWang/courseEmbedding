financial inclusion and skills training with a particular focus on subsaharan africa we put the people we serve at the center of our program design and take a holistic longterm approach to our work we believe the key to prosperity is through education skills training and financial inclusion see more of our work financial inclusion hundreds of millions of people in africa many of them living in poverty lack access to basic financial products and services in many rural and remote communities there are simply no bank branches or atms banks and other financial service providers often see these clients as too risky too remote and too poor to serve financial inclusion means that lowincome individuals households and small businesses have access to and can effectively use appropriate financial services such as savings credit and insurance it also means these services are provided responsibly and sustainably in a wellregulated environment access to appropriate financial services allows people greater opportunity to reach their economic goals it can also enable those living in poverty to smooth the financial impacts of unexpected crop failure food shortage illness or other negative events in their lives read more see our financial inclusion work education  learning program millions of young people in africa lack access to a quality education only   percent of young people move from primary to secondary school and only  percent transition to university research shows that education is an effective path out of poverty particularly for women we define education as learning that takes place both within and outside of the formal school system our partnerships focus on providing quality accessible secondary and tertiary education as well as skills development for those living in poverty with chronic unemployment and underemployment on the continent we believe it is important to focus on appropriate education that addresses foundational skills such as literacy and

skills educational institutions may not provide a relevant or highquality curriculum that addresses the needs of the labour market young people may also not have the chance to develop work experience in the formal sector or they may have to drop out of school due to cost our youth livelihoods program helps the transition from education to employment by providing young people with a comprehensive

fulltime more than  yearsprosbonusgood location in ofallon missouri in suburbs outside of st louisgreat if you are in leadership ranksconsif you are in technical ranks and on a product team it will feel like slave labor many folks they bring over on a work visa that cant leave a company for  years then they work them to death if you are not on a product team you likely will be just managing propaganda and branding your team more work is spend on saying look what i did at mastercard than actually doing work unless you are on a product teamon a product team it is pretty much working x to get the product out the door on a shoe string budget cowboy style of delivery where you throw something together and pull the trigger to get it into production and hope for the best tehnical folks are required to be available all of the time long hours in the middle of the night and all night on many occasions no overtime pay unless you are consulting but if you record what you work theyll get rid of you and get someone you will work more but report less leadership does not typically work more than  hours a week where technical resources can be working all of the time the greatest caution i can give you if you decide to work for mastercard is be positive always and never make a negative comment or be too objective roll with the flow and stay away from the front of the bus extremely political climate with low technical aptitude individuals in the technical ranks the culture for technical folks is to get a bunch of people in a room and have them fight it out the best salesman wins vs the most intelligent one or the one with the most experience if you have a sales background with just a generalist understanding of technology youll do great at mastercard if you are a specialist with experience vs just reading something and selling it youll go crazy nothing worse than having more technical vs sales skills in the mastercard environment other largest con i can think of is that you will receive no pay for performance at all it is entirely based on what project you are working on little in the way of career growth at mastercard this is a consulting environment and nothing more you will not grow though im an sbl i am one of the few that lead and the pressures for shoestring budget are ridiculousadvice to managementpay for performancestop killing your technical labor force  dont let business folks working  hours a week drive technical resources to work  hours a week and report less in the name of a shoestring budgetthe best advice i can give to management is that you need managers ive been in  different teams over the years and only ran into  true leaders the rest were admin folks on a power trip or young inexperience yopros which is the most common you need more experienced business leaders that have intelligence not just youg enegetic individuals with low amounts of experience in a very long timeframe ive only ran into one senior business leader that was leading over there team its like a country club at that level have these folks coach and manage also hire more americans locally in ofallon missouri mastercard foundation   pdt see all  reviewsview

foundation grants for global development — inside philanthropy global development – funders april   mastercard foundation grants for global development april   suelynn moses and renata redford overview the mastercard foundation focuses its global development grantmaking on financial inclusion education and learning and youth livelihoodsip take the mastercard foundation funds a wide range of issues but is not an easily accessible foundation as it tends to partner with large ngos and academic institutions over local and grassroots organizationsprofile gifted with shares from the financial services company mastercard the mastercard foundation was established in  and functions separately from its corporate sister  the foundation ultimately seeks to “advance education and financial inclusion to catalyze prosperity in developing countries” it prioritizes giving in africa to create an inclusive more equitable africa by supporting the implementation of proven development models and scalable approaches the foundation believes that the key to prosperity is through education skills training and financial inclusion and as such its investments reflect this dedication the foundation prioritizes initiatives related to education inclusion the livelihood of young people and improving access to financial services among others in order to foster and facilitate more opportunities for disadvantaged populations in lowincome countries the foundation awards grants through three main programs financial inclusion education  learning and youth livelihoods while the mastercard foundation has awarded grants to projects in lowincome countries around the world africa is now the priority regionpreferring a more broad approach the foundations programs tackle larger issues on multiple fronts for example its financial inclusion program not only awards grants for financial product and services access but also for rural and agricultural financing expanding informal savings groups microcredit and mobile banking the mastercard foundations grants range from  to  for multiyear programs the foundation also awards several  grants between  million to  million however it does not accept unsolicited letters of inquiry about funding or what it refers to as “concept notes” the foundation occasionally issues requests for proposals as well its fund for rural prosperity—a  million challenge program to expand rural financial services in africa—has a twostage application processinformation is a bit sparse on the mastercard foundation’s application process for the remainder of its programs according to the foundation’s most recent tax filings once it reviews a concept note if the work aligns with the foundation’s objectives it will invite the applicant to submit a full proposal the best bet here would be to reach out to program staff for clarity on the foundation’s application processpeople  reeta roy president and ceoann miles director youth livelihoods and financial
