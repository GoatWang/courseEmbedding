image for details dear fellow wintergreen fund shareholder excerpt from the  annual report shareholder letter posted march   looking back on wintergreen fund incs the fund  results two related themes stick out in bold relief first theres simply no sure thing in this world  no sure winner no sure loser no sure outcome because of that investors need to be prepared for the unexpected owning undervalued companies that can survive if not thrive in a broad range of market conditions second every vote matters whether shareholder or citizen with that in mind we at wintergreen advisers look for companies that respect and live by good governance if we are invested and dont see that theres a good chance we will ask management to change or we will ask shareholders to join us in bringing about that change quite literally we are active managers the vote matters the fund had strong  returns from longterm portfolio holdings reynolds american inc reynolds birchcliff energy ltd and altria group inc securities that underperformed included canadian natural resources ltd which the fund sold during the year swatch group ag and provident financial plc the fund also employed forward currency contracts which had an overall positive impact on performance during the year if you would be a real seeker after truthit is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt as far as possible all things  rené descartes lets look at some highlights for the fund in last years annual letter we noted many virtues of reynolds as a core portfolio investment for many years a smart management team combined reynolds with lorillard inc in an earningsaccretive deal creating an even more powerful cash generating business in the process the company increased its appeal to british american tobacco plc bat its largest owner with  of outstanding shares as a mustown asset to fully capture opportunities in the us and benefit from reynoldss product innovations our belief that bat would eventually bid for the rest of the shares came to fruition last october resulting in a surge in the value of reynolds the funds largest holding with an improved deal price and structure more favorable to shareholders reynolds agreed to the takeover in january of  closing is expected by the adviser to occur in the third quarter of  as shareholders of bat another top holding of the fund we hope to continue to collect the steady amounts of cash returned by this combined powerhouse continue reading the  annual report shareholder letter view a recent listing of the funds top  holdings david j

may purchase risk arbitrage securities securities of companies involved in a restructuring or distressed companies these companies may not be successful in their restructuring and securities of distressed companies are generally more likely to become worthless than securities of more financially stable companies smaller companies involve substantial risk as these securities are traditionally more volatile in price than larger company securities value risk is that the securities in which the fund invests may never reach what the investment manager believes are their full market values securities rated below investment grade sometimes called junk bonds involve a greater degree of risk than investment grade bonds in return for higher yield potential the fund may be subject to interest rate risk which is the risk that debt securities in the funds portfolio will decline in value because of increases in market interest rates by participating in derivative securities the fund may attempt to hedge protect against currency risk which is the risk that the value of foreign securities may be affected by changes in currency exchange rates derivatives can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risks depending upon the characteristics of a particular derivative international investing involves certain risks and increased volatility not associated with investing solely in the us these risks include currency fluctuations economic or financial instability lack of timely or reliable financial information or unfavorable political or legal developments these risks are magnified in emerging markets as a result of appreciation of certain of the funds portfolio securities andor a change in the size of the fund investments in a particular sector or industry may represent a significant portion of the funds overall portfolio if this occurs the fund will be subject to greater potential risk than funds that do not have as much exposure to such sector or industry

annual report to shareholders by business wire—  am et  mountain lakes njbusiness wire wintergreen fund inc has released its  annual report the shareholder letter appears below and is also available at httpwwwwintergreenfundcom dear fellow wintergreen fund shareholder looking back on wintergreen fund wgrnx inc’s  results two related themes stick out in bold relief first there’s simply no sure thing in this world — no sure winner no sure loser no sure outcome because of that investors need to be prepared for the unexpected owning undervalued companies that can survive if not thrive in a broad range of market conditions second every vote matters whether shareholder or citizen with that in mind we at wintergreen advisers look for companies that respect and live by good governance if we are invested and don’t see that there’s a good chance we will ask management to change or we will ask shareholders to join us in bringing about that change quite literally we are active managers the vote matters the fund had strong  returns from longterm portfolio holdings reynolds american inc rai  birchcliff energy ltd tmx bir and altria group inc mo  securities that underperformed included canadian natural resources ltd which the fund sold during the year swatch group ag and provident financial plc the fund also employed forward currency contracts which had an overall positive impact on performance during the year if you would be a real seeker after truthit is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt as far as possible all things rené descartes let’s look at some highlights for the fund in last year’s annual letter we noted many virtues of reynolds as a core portfolio investment for many years a smart management team combined reynolds with lorillard inc in an earningsaccretive deal creating an even more powerful cash generating business in the process the company increased its appeal to british american tobacco plc bti  its largest owner with  of outstanding shares as a mustown asset to fully capture opportunities in the us and benefit from reynolds’s product innovations our belief that bat would eventually bid for the rest of the shares came to fruition last october resulting in a surge in the value of reynolds the fund’s largest holding with an improved deal price and structure more favorable to shareholders reynolds agreed to the takeover in january of  closing is expected by the adviser to occur in the third quarter of  as shareholders of bat another top holding of the fund we hope to continue to collect the steady amounts of cash returned by this combined powerhouse like the tobacco industry the oil and gas industry is also undergoing consolidation and the fund has benefited from its holding in baker hughes inc bhi  the fund’s position in bhi was initiated in late  as an arbitrage opportunity when halliburton company “hal” bid for bhi and as a proxy for an anticipated return to growth in the oil services industry because the outcome of the merger was uncertain the deal was written with a breakup fee of  billion which we viewed as an attractive safety cushion for bhi in the event that the merger agreement was terminated the deal did indeed break around mid and hal paid the breakup fee to bhi which then commenced a massive buyback of its stock shortly thereafter general electric co made an approach to merge its own oil and gas business unit with bhi the board of bhi approved the transaction and the merger is scheduled to close in the middle of  we highlight this arbitrage win for the fund as an example of an investment strategy that we sometimes employ as a supplement to our core value investing style … we must think and act not only for the moment but for our time marshal hubert lyautey quoted by john f kennedy french marshal lyautey was a world war one european leader who was driven by his own complex moral code as he searched for intelligent solutions to what were the unprecedented problems of the day he was a thoughtful man who inspired many including john f kennedy and recognized the vital need to plan for both short and long term international solutions elbit systems ltd tlv eslt “elbit” of israel may seem an unusual pick for the fund’s portfolio but it’s exactly the kind of business we look for a global company addressing global needs with sustained expanding demand elbit provides a wide range of defense homeland security and commercial programs that — regrettably — have become a foundation of modern life elbit’s operations cover the range of defense systems from aircraft to drones and unmanned surface vessels to computer and intelligence systems to electronic warfare and signal intelligence systems the nature of military conflict has changed with isolated dispersed and intheshadows incidents more common than a conventional war fought in the open today countries need to be prepared for a series of both low intensity conflicts and ongoing terrorist activities this requires a portfolio of responses that elbit delivers and hones an existential result of being constantly surrounded by hostile activity due to its location governments with either pressured defense budgets or relatively smaller budgets to begin with are increasingly turning to this nimble defense contractor whereas some prime contractors in the us and europe have experienced flat topline growth in recent years elbit has managed a  compound annual growth rate in sales over the last five years mainly through increased orders from governments in asiapacific and latin america although operating margins are currently lower than those of us prime contractors we believe it is only a matter of time before the gap is narrowed adding increased profits to elbit’s bottom line elbit may be the most potent defense company you have never heard of but we are pleased to share this investment opportunity with you in a gentle way you can shake the world mahatma ghandi most investors are familiar with heineken holding nv ams heio “heineken” in particular because of its dark green premium beer bottle second only to corona in us imported beer heineken is sold virtually everywhere in the world growing from a single brewery in amsterdam in  to the secondlargest beer company in the world today heineken brews more than  brands with widespread name recognition of amstel dos equis sol and tiger in addition to its premium flagship brand the company is focused on continued growth in emerging markets five years ago only about  of its profits came from developing markets that percentage now exceeds  the company has been able to combine sales growth with stable and improving margins forming one of the pillars of our investment thesis in the company heineken’s management also keeps a sharp eye on efficient capital deployment adhering to hard rona return on net assets metrics in combination with well defined executive compensation plan determinants this properly ties management pay to performance make no mistake the global beer business is extremely competitive but we believe heineken management is out in front seeking major growth opportunities at the time of this writing the company is working on a transaction intended to increase its business in india and has just finalized a deal in brazil we live in uncertain times because of that we believe it useful to reiterate the foundation of the fund’s investment principles specifically when investing the fund’s assets we look for a business that has good or improving economics one that often generates sales and profits in multiple markets and currencies a management team working to benefit all longterm shareholders not just for its own shortterm compensation and a security at a compelling price we keep moving forward opening up new doors and doing new things…and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths walt disney despite the uncertainties at home and abroad we believe the future is bright for the fund’s portfolio companies and our process stands to uncover new investment opportunities we believe our investment approach helps to limit downside risk through careful analysis and has the potential for substantial upside over time in our opinion investors who are careful with their money invest for the longterm and don’t borrow or invest on margin greatly increase their chances of success by being sensible in their investment approach an investor stacks the deck for their longterm opportunity thank you for your continued investment in wintergreen fund wgrnx
