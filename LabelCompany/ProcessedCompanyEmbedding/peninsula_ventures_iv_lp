believe in what matters in great people in hard work and in the consistency it takes to deliver solid returns year after year we believe in success and we measure it by the companies we help build at peninsula ventures we believe in creativity innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit because the ones who matter most are the entrepreneurs whose ideas keep moving the world ahead venture on portfolio being an entrepreneur isn’t easy we understand that’s why we’re there to support you as you contend with the inevitable ups and downs of building a worldclass business after all the road can be rough but it’s always rewarding ultimately it’s our goal to make certain we’re all successful current investments select prior investments approach the approach matters working with early state companies comes with many responsibilities we think one of them is treating entrepreneurs with respect our entrepreneurs think of us as partners who care about their businesses people who have a genuine interest and make contributions without adding stress after all building a business that matters is enough pressure already we’re constantly searching for the next great market the key to finding one obviously is knowing where to look we leverage our experience with past investments and the insights we gain from working with different companies to help identify these markets and the new technologies that emerge to us being an investor means being an active part of an ecosystem that is changing right before our eyes key industry sectors we focus primarily on software infrastructure and core technology within these sectors there are a number of themes that are of particular interest of course we don’t limit ourselves to these areas alone we’re always willing to work with great ideas—and great entrepreneurs early stage companies we focus on the early stage because that’s where we can have the greatest impact and provide the most value to entrepreneurs not coincidentally it’s also where great companies are made peninsula ventures is an active and supportive investor staying with a company from the early stage through a successful exit and beyond capital efficiency and scale we look for entrepreneurs who can spend capital efficiently and still build a business that has potential to scale part of that comes from the type of product or service they’re developing and part of it comes from the culture they create we believe that too much money can kill a company’s creativity taking away the hunger and the drive that are essential for success market disruptive or emerging we evaluate companies in large markets that have the potential to be disruptive and we evaluate companies in emerging markets that have the potential to grow rapidly we believe that when great entrepreneurs pursue innovative solutions to significant problems in any market revolutionary companies are born advantage high barriers to entry we start by looking for a unique firsttomarket product or service with a sustainable advantage or well look for a fast follower with a competitive advantage thats strong enough to topple incumbents if the company has advantages in place that create high barriers to entry they have the advantages we need geography usbased companies location is important but its not everything were open to companies located anywhere in the united states although we prefer those headquartered in the western us for a more effortless flow of information and ideas team we have one goal helping build innovative companies that deliver outstanding returns with decades of venture and operational experience we have the breadth and depth of knowledge to identify smart investment opportunities the same goes for providing guidance to our entrepreneurs our experience and collaborative approach makes this team better suited to work with yours greg ennis over gregs  year venture career he has invested in dozens of early stage technology
