qualifications to sit on our board of directors include his substantial experience in the area of corporate strategy operations and finance role in risk oversight one of the key functions of our board of directors is informed oversight of our risk management process our board of directors administers this oversight function directly with support from the three standing committees our audit committee our compensation committee and our nominating and corporate governance committee each of which address risks specific to its respective areas of oversight in particular our audit committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management takes to monitor and control these exposures including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken our audit committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in addition to oversight of the performance of our internal audit function our compensation committee assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risktaking our nominating and corporate governance committee provides oversight with respect to corporate governance and ethical conduct and monitors the effectiveness of our corporate governance guidelines including whether such guidelines are successful in preventing illegal or improper liabilitycreating conduct all committees report to the full board as appropriate including when a matter rises to the level of a material or enterpriselevel risk in addition the board of directors receives detailed regular reports from members of our senior management and other personnel that include assessments and potential mitigation of the risks and exposures involved with their respective areas of responsibility independence of board members the nyse listing standards generally require the majority of the members of the board of directors and all members of the audit committee compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee to be independent under nyse standards because we were considered a controlled company under nyse standards until shortly after the  table of contents completion of our initial public offering ipo we currently qualify for an exemption from this requirement we are required to have independent directors comprise a majority of our board of directors and all of our committees by october   the board of directors has determined that each of the following three nonemployee director candidates is independent in accordance with the nyse listing standards • michael koen • sergio pedreiro • b clyde preslar mr burke is an employee of the company and as such is not considered an independent director messrs budenbender miller parker and rinklin are affiliated with star atlantic waste holding lp and thus are not considered independent directors we define an independent director in accordance with section a of the listed company manual of the nyse and the board makes an affirmative determination at least annually as to the independence of each director the nyse independence definition includes a series of objective tests such as that the director is not an employee of the company and has not engaged in various types of business dealings with the company because it is not possible to anticipate or explicitly provide for all potential conflicts of interest that may affect independence the board is also responsible for determining affirmatively as to each independent director that such director has no material relationships with the company either directly or as a partner shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company in making these determinations the board broadly considers all relevant facts and circumstances including information provided by the directors and the company with regard to each director’s business and personal activities as they may relate to the company and the company’s management as the concern is independence from management the board does not view ownership of even a significant amount of stock by itself as a bar to an independence finding the board reviewed all commercial and nonprofit affiliations of each independent nonemployee director and the dollar amount of all transactions between the company and each entity with which an independent nonemployee director is affiliated to determine independence the board concluded there are no transactions between the company and any entity with which an independent nonemployee director is affiliated that a are prohibited by section a of the listed company manual of the nyse b are material individually or in the aggregate or c in which any of the company’s independent nonemployee directors have or had a material direct or indirect interest accordingly the board has determined that each independent nonemployee director candidate meets the independence requirements of the nyse and that there are no relationships that would affect independence meetings and board committees last year the board held nine meetings and each committee of the board met independently as set forth below each director attended at least  of the meetings of the board and the committees on which he or she served the board generally meets in executive session without management present for a portion of each regular meeting of the board although we do not have a formal policy regarding director attendance at annual meetings all directors are expected to attend unless there are unavoidable schedule conflicts or unforeseen circumstances the board appoints committees to help carry out its duties committee members take on greater responsibility for key issues and the committee reviews the results of its meetings with the full board the board has three separate standing committees the audit committee the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee additionally the board has the power to appoint additional committees as it deems necessary the audit committee mr preslar is the chairman of our audit committee the other members of our audit committee are messrs koen and miller messrs preslar and koen satisfy the additional nyse independence standards for audit committees set forth in section a of the exchange act the company is using the exemption set forth in section a of the exchange act which allows mr miller to be exempt from the independence requirements for one year from the effective date of our initial public offering this exemption did not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the audit committee to act independently our audit committee held five meetings in fiscal   our board of directors has determined that mr preslar and mr miller each is an audit committee financial expert as defined by the sec based on a thorough review of their education and financial and public company experience see board members section above for further details on each of their qualifications the audit committee’s duties are set forth in

fiscal  with up to onethird of the total psus eligible to be earned each year and ultimately payable at the end of the threeyear period performance is measured based  on adjusted ebitda  on adjusted ebitda less capital expenditures and  on revenue excluding fuel surcharges commodities and landfill gas sales as described under annual cash bonus opportunities adjusted ebitda is used in our psu program as it is a key measure of the profitability of our business that is tracked by stockholders and adjusted ebitda less capital expenditures is used a measure of our ability to effectively manage capital expenditures the compensation committee also uses revenue for psus to focus management on profitable growth in the business performance will be assessed annually over each of the three years based on goals established at the beginning of each year if performance on an individual measure is at the planned level for the year  of the target psus for that measure will be earned if performance on an individual measure is below the threshold level of  of the planned level of performance for that measure no psus will be earned for that measure in that year if performance for an individual measure is at threshold  of the target psus for the measure will be earned if performance on an individual measure is at or above the maximum level of  of the planned level of performance  of the target psus will be earned between threshold and planned performance and between planned performance and maximum performance straightline interpolation will be used to determine awards at the end of the threeyear period the total psus earned will equal the sum of the psus earned for each of the three individual years restricted stock awards we grant restricted stock awards to our executives to support retention and align the interests of our executives with those of stockholders by increasing executive stock ownership onethird of the restricted stock awards granted in fiscal  vest at each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant the executive will vest in any dividends on the shares at the time the shares vest stock options we grant stock options to focus our executives on increasing our stock price over the midterm to longterm onethird of the stock options granted in fiscal  under our core longterm incentive program vest at each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant the stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and are exercisable from the date of vesting to the tenth anniversary of the date of grant for our executives including our neos upon a change in control as defined in the  plan all outstanding timebased options will subject to certain limitations become fully exercisable and vested and any restrictions and deferral limitations applicable to any stock purchase rights will lapse for awards under the  plan upon a change in control and subsequent terminations of the executives other than for cause all outstanding equity awards will become fully vested and all outstanding stock options will become fully exercisable we believe that providing for acceleration upon a liquidity event such as a change of control helps to align the interests of the executives with those of the stockholders  table of contents ipo stock option and rsu grants in fiscal  the compensation committee approved special longterm incentive grants to our neos in conjunction with our ipo prior to the ipo the compensation committee conducted an extensive analysis of longterm incentive award levels and equity ownership among the peer group of comparable companies identified by pearl meyer and discussed in the compensation determination process section above it was determined that our executives had total equity holdings below the peer group competitive levels and that increasing the level of ownership among our executive team would enhance their alignment with stockholders the ipo grants were issued in a mix of stock options and timevested rsus with variation in the mix of the two vehicles by executive stock options were used to focus executives on increasing the stock price from the ipo offering price of  rsus were intended to enhance the alignment of our executives with the interests of stockholders by increasing their stock ownership the ipo awards to the neos were

discretion we may also provide certain executives with enhancements to our existing benefits that are not available to other employees such as usage of a company car or a car allowance and usage of the company plane which we believe are typical benefits for executives of comparable companies with which we compete for talent and represent a relatively small portion of their overall compensation furthermore we pay for life insurance benefits in an amount equal to the neos base salary plus bonus potential the neos may designate a beneficiary of their choosing under the life insurance severance and other benefits payable upon termination of employment or change in control we believe that severance protections can play a valuable role in attracting and retaining high caliber talent in the competitive market for executive talent we believe severance payments and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to offset the risk of foregoing an opportunity with another company consistent with our objective of using severance payments and benefits to attract and retain executives we generally provide each neo with amounts and types of severance payments and benefits that we believe will permit us to attract andor continue to employ the individual neo the severance benefits provided under the neo employment agreements are generally more favorable than the benefits payable under our general severance policy for example the neo employment agreements provide for a severance benefit  table of contents payable upon a termination by us without cause or by the neo for good reason details on neo severance arrangements can be found below under summary of neo employment agreements employment agreements we have entered into employment

shares underlying unvested rsus and  shares of common stock that would be issued under outstanding psus if the target performance level is achieved  excludes restricted stock awards rsus and psus because those awards do not have exercise prices associated with them  approved by stockholders prior to our ipo reconciliation of certain nongaap measures adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not defined terms under us generally accepted accounting principles “nongaap measures” nongaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income income per diluted share or cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies we define ebitda as net income loss from continuing operations adjusted for interest taxes depreciation and amortization and accretion we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted to exclude noncash and nonrecurring items as well as other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the agreements governing our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating our performance compared to other companies in our industry because it eliminates the effect of financing income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending as well as certain items that are not indicative of our performance on an ongoing basis management uses adjusted ebitda to measure the performance of our core operations at the consolidated segment and business unit levels and as a metric for a significant portion of our management incentive plans in fiscal  we made a strategic decision to enter into fuel derivatives as economic hedges of a rise in the price of diesel fuel for fiscal  and fiscal  we have not entered into fuel derivatives since fiscal  when the economic hedges for fiscal  and fiscal  were put in place and have no present intention to enter into fuel derivatives in  we therefore believe that excluding realized losses from fuel derivatives provides useful additional information for investors to evaluate comparability among periods and is consistent with how management evaluates performance in fiscal  we entered into  table of contents interest rate caps as economic hedges of a rise in interest rates for fiscal  fiscal  and the nine months ended september   we believe that excluding realized and unrealized gains and losses from interest rate derivatives from our adjusted ebitda provides useful additional information in evaluating ongoing financial performance of the business as these derivatives represent a risk management tool to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates and are viewed by management as a financing cost similar to interest expense adjusted ebitda the following table calculates adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion adjusted for certain other costs in millions of dollars

stockholders are entitled to an advisory nonbinding vote on compensation programs for our named executive officers sometimes referred to as “say on pay” we encourage stockholders to review the compensation discussion and analysis of this proxy statement we have designed our executive compensation program to be supportive of and align with our strategy and the creation of stockholder value while discouraging excessive risktaking the following key structural elements and policies discussed in more detail in the compensation discussion and analysis  further the objective of our executive compensation program and evidence our dedication to competitive and reasonable compensation practices that are in the best interests of stockholders   • a substantial portion of executive compensation is linked to our performance through annual cash incentive performance criteria and longterm equitybased incentive awards as a result our executive compensation program provides for a significant difference in total compensation in periods of abovetarget performance as compared to periods of belowtarget performance in fiscal   our performancebased annual cash incentive and longterm equitybased incentive awards comprised approximately  of total target compensation for our chief executive officer and approximately  of total target compensation for our other named executives • at target approximately  of total compensation of our named executives and approximately  in the case of our chief executive officer results from longterm equity awards which aligns executives’ interests with those of stockholders • performancebased awards include threshold target and maximum payouts correlating to a range of performance goals and are based on a variety of indicators of performance which limits risktaking behavior and • psus and restricted stock awards with a threeyear performance period as well as stock options that vest over a threeyear period link executives’ interests with longterm performance and reduce incentives to maximize performance in any one year as a matter of good corporate governance the board is asking stockholders to approve the following advisory

the compensation committee will be required to take any action as a result of the outcome of the vote on this proposal the compensation committee will carefully consider the outcome of the vote in connection with future executive compensation arrangements the board recommends that you vote for the approval of our executive compensation  table of contents advisory vote on frequency of future advisory votes on named executive officer compensation   item  on the proxy card we are providing stockholders with an advisory nonbinding vote on whether future “say on pay” advisory votes similar to the prior proposal should occur every year every two years or every three years  the board has determined that an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation that occurs annually is the most appropriate interval conducting an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation every year will enhance stockholder communication and provide the company with regular feedback on its executive compensation practices and philosophy accordingly our board recommends you vote for a oneyear interval for the advisory vote on named executive officer compensation  the proxy card provides stockholders with the opportunity to choose among four options holding the vote every one two or three years or abstaining and therefore stockholders will not be voting to approve or disapprove the board’s recommendation  because the vote is advisory it will not be binding upon the board or the compensation committee however the compensation committee will carefully consider the outcome of the vote when deciding how often to conduct future stockholder advisory votes on named executive officer compensation  the board recommends that you vote for the option of every year for future advisory votes on executive compensation  table of contents other matters   we do not intend to bring any other matters before the annual meeting nor do we have any present knowledge that any other matters
