employees aum portfolio values historical f current portfolio holdings new positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by

universe a different class of investment are managed futures   commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because

business company bvi bc ibc  an international business company  is the most commonly used official name for what is more popularly known as an offshore company ibcs are the basic building blocks of the offshore financial services industry essentially a modern ibc is a private corporation which is exempt from tax suitable for virtually any international business activity has a flexible organizational structure is not burdened by excessive reporting and recordkeeping requirements and maintains strict confidentiality provisions since the adoption of the british virgin islands international business companies ordinance in  the bvi ibc has attained a model status in the offshore services industry with more than  total incorporations and more than  new companies registered every month bvi is by far the most popular offshore tax haven such is the dominance of the british virgin islands as an offshore corporate domicile that in many regions of the far east international business companies are called simply as bvis in january   a brandnew version of the bvi business companies act came into force the new act represents a further development in the already outstanding bvi offshore corporate legislation the new law successfully addresses the challenges faced by the offshore financial industry in the st century in particular the pressures against illegal discrimination between domestic and offshore companies thus the new bvi business companies act removes any former distinction between a local company operating in the domestic market and an offshore company restricted only to international business according to the new act there is now only one unified type of company  a bvi business company which continues to be exempt from tax and continues to enjoy all the substantial benefits afforded by the previous legislation the chief minister of the bvi dr the hon d orlando smith said at the announcement of the new legislation the new bvi business companies act was designed to safeguard the attributes that have made the bvi the worlds premier offshore company domicile the collaborative effort to draft this new act has resulted in legislation that not only retains all the virtues of the current ibc act but makes the bvi even more attractive to clients by including new features that have become desirable since the enactment of the current act a full text of the consolidated bvi business companies act is available in our downloads section cornerstones of success these are some of the general advantages of the british virgin islands over many other offshore financial centres us dollar is the official currency in the bvi  therefore by definition there can be no currency controls and no artificial manipulation of money supply by the local government bvi are a british overseas territory which provides for an outstanding political stability the country also maintains a low international profile and a clean reputation thus avoiding the pitfalls experienced by some more publicised and less scrupulous offshore tax havens bvi has an independent judicial system based on english common law laws and regulations are routinely developed in consultation with the private sector offshore financial services sector contributes a very significant part to the countrys gross domestic product therefore an inherent and pronounced interest exists both with the government and with the general public to maintain and develop the countrys status as a competitive offshore financial centre bvi is an independent country with a fairly high standard of living therefore it avoided entering any informationsharing agreements with foreign countries or organizations for exchange of financial aid client confidentiality is robustly enshrined in the bvi corporate and business legislation bvi is easily accessible by sea and air has modern telecommunications and is on us eastern standard time  hour behind est in winters the most important characteristics of a bvi bc in detail exemption from tax a bvi business company is exempt from the bvi income tax the same exemption applies to all dividends interest rents royalties compensations and other amounts paid by a company and all capital gains realised with respect to any shares debt obligations or other securities of the company no estate inheritance succession or gift tax is payable with respect to any shares debt obligations or other securities of a bvi bc all transactions and instruments relating to transfers of any type of property of assets shares debt obligations or securities to or by a bvi bc are exempt from the stamp duty with a sole exception for landownership transactions in the british virgin islands in which case stamp duty remains payable legal personality a british virgin islands business company has separate legal personality and the same powers as a natural person secrecy confidentiality is one of the key features of the bvi business company as details of the company beneficial owners directors and shareholders are not part of public record register of members register of directors and all minutes and resolutions by the company are kept only at the offices of the registered agent in complete confidentiality certainly though these files are available for inspection to company shareholders the only documents held on public record are the memorandum and articles of association but these normally do not contain any indication as to the actual shareholders directors or the beneficial owners of the company at the same time if the owners of the company so wish the register of directors andor the register of members may be filed with the registrar of companies such step may be desirable if a complete certainly must be achieved and showed publicly as to the actual identities of the company managers or members  but again this is purely optional structural flexibility a bvi business company requires a minimum of only one owner one shareholder and one director all of them can be one and the same person apart from the director the company need not appoint any operating officers the management structure of the bvi business company may be designed in accordance with the widest variety of requirements the shareholders directors and officers of a bvi business company may be individuals or corporations and of any nationality the shareholders or directors meetings need not be held in the british virgin islands and there is no requirement for an annual general meeting meetings can be held by telephone or other electronic means alternatively directors as well as shareholders may vote by proxy where a business company has only one member who is an individual and that member is also the sole director such sole member  director may specifically appoint a reserve director to act in his place in the event of his death provisions against confiscation if a foreign government or authority seizes company shares or any other interest in the company in connection with nationalization expropriation confiscatory tax other governmental charge or with a similar cause the company or a shareholder may apply to the bvi court for an order that the company disregard the seizure and continue to treat the person from whom the shares were seized as continuing to hold the shares no reporting bvi business companies does not have an obligation to prepare of file financial accounts however records must be kept that are sufficient to show and explain the companys transactions and will at any time enable the financial position of the company to be determined with reasonable accuracy such records do not have to be kept in the british virgin islands and the location for keeping such records can be freely determined by the owners of the company and there is no requirement whatsoever to file or otherwise make public any commercial or financial records of the company bearer shares shares of a bvi business company may be issued in bearer form however the bearer shares may not be issued to their actual owner but may only be kept in custody of a licensed custodian in the bvi or with such custodian outside bvi together with a written indication as to the actual identity and address of the owner of such shares the schedule of government fees for bvi business companies contains a clear negative incentive against utilising bearer shares in the structuring of the business companies as the government fees for such companies will be considerably higher various types of incorporations a bvi business company may be incorporated as a company limited by shares a company limited by guarantee with or without authorisation to issue shares an unlimited company with or without authorisation to issue shares a segregated portfolio company and a restricted purpose company no requirement to state operational objects since  there is no requirement to specify the operational objects of the bvi business company in the foundation documents of the company memorandum and articles of association however the company may choose to do so and indeed a specific type of a restricted purpose company is envisaged by the business companies act company names a bvi business company may not be registered under a name that is identical to the name of an existing bvi company or is so similar to the name of an existing bvi company that in the opinion of the registrar such name would be likely to confuse or mislead as the bvi registrar of companies has a namereservation system a reserved name would also be considered as an already existing name without obtaining a prior written consent of the financial servies commission a bvi business company may not be registered under a name that contains a restricted word or phrase according to a published list of such restrictions  such as the words assurance bank building society chamber of commerce chartered cooperative imperial municipal royal trust or any word conveying a similar meaning as well as any name suggesting the patronage of the british royalty british bvi or any other government or its department the registrar may also refuse the registration of any particular name if in the opinion of the registrar such name is offensive or for any other reason objectionable the nameendings denoting the type of company the name of a limited
