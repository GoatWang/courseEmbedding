biopharma inc a subsidiary of biomatrix scientific group inc otcbb bmsn is a biotechnology company focused on identifying undervalued regenerative medicine applications in the stem cell space and rapidly advancing these technologies through preclinical andphase i ii clinical trials     our business model is to acquire and form companies around undervalued assets identified froma highly focused analysis of issued patents in regenerative medicinethat have demonstrated proof of concept   dr ichim is one of the leading authorities in the world on stem cell biology a stem cell incubator company with an emphasis on stem cell regenerative medicine     our business model  regen biopharma                                regen biopharma has assessed over  stem cell related issued patents narrowed down to  patents with commercial applicability and further identified  patents available for licensing the company seeks to inlicense take the product to and through clinical safety and efficacy signal and spin out technologies     our approach  regen biopharma                     regen biopharma avoids waste of one productone infrastructure approach       in the conventional model stem cell companies are started with one basic technology infrastructure is developed around that                       technology then if the technology fails significant resources are lost that have been used in the productspecific development                conventional model              regen biopharma model   operational plan   month  assembly of team regen intends to assemble a team of worldclass leaders in the spheres of technology intellectual property assessment valuation and clinical development regen will seek to compile a team of physicianscientists with experience in the area of clinical trials for regenerative medicinestem cell products regulatory experts who have successfully taken products through the fda and corresponding agencies internationally and biotech entrepreneurs who have track records of excellence in business formation and value optimization done   month  inlicensing of intellectual property the company having already assessed over  issued patents and havingcompiled a shortlist of  targets regen will seek to execute licensing deals on an initial core of  technologies regen focuses onissued patents that have already passed preclinical studies but are not under clinical development done   month  interaction with regulatory agencies regen intends to develop data packages for each of the technologies andinitiate interaction with regulatory agencies such as the fda for initiation of trialsdone   month  clinical implementation regen intends to launch clinical trials with worldleading institutions to obtain human safety data and signal of therapeutic efficacy  next up   month  exit it is intended that technologies incubated by regen will be spun off either as separate companies or sold to large pharma companies seeking to enhance their therapeutic pipeline       at present there exists a wealth of intellectual property that is collecting dust in the corridors of academia given the field of regenerative medicine and stem cell therapy is so young and the business models are fuzzy at best in terms of valuation we see this space as a unique opportunity for acceleration of clinical developmentvalue optimization said biomatrix chairman  ceo david koos about its regen biopharma valuations for stem cell companies that have passed the threshold of clinical safety with signals of efficacy are astronomical the  billion mesoblastcephalon deal as well as recent financings of private companies with as little as  patient data such as promethera  million or allocure with  patients  million is testimony to the extremely high valuations that are characteristic of this space     regen biopharma pipeline   hemaxellerate i™ fda filing regen biopharma filed an investigational new drug ind application on february th   regen biopharma has received approval from the fda for the clinical protocol and the product manufacturing information for hemaxellerate i  on may   regen biopharma submitted clarification on animal safety studies that the fda requested with review anticipated within  days hemaxellerate i is a cellular therapy designed to heal damaged bone marrow hemaxellarate i utilizes a collection of cells harvested from the patient’s own adipose fat tissue to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of blood cells  the initial application of hemaxellerate i will be the treatment of severe aplastic anemia a rare and serious condition in which the bone marrow fails to make enough blood cells red blood cells white blood cells and platelets in practice the physician is shipped a kit which is used to collect adipose tissue the tissue is sent to a processing facility and a standardized cellular product is delivered in a readytouse manner for administration into the patient intravenously the company intends to seek orphan drug designation under the orphan drug act of  from the us food and drug administration for hemaxellerate i   dcellvax™ regen biopharma is currently in the preclinical stage of development for dcellvax and plans to file an investigational new drug application in august  the dcellvax therapeutic product is based on extracting blood from patients growing a specialized type of immune cell from the blood called the dendritic cell and then subsequently genetically modifying the dendritic cell to become resistant to cancers immune suppressive activity it is known that cancer modifies the immune system by producing proteins which result in immune suppression one such protein which cancer stimulates is an enzyme indolamine  deoxygenase ido which cancer turns on in dendritic cells while dendritic cells are usually immune stimulators dendritic cells found in cancer patients suppress the immune system as a result of expressing ido the dcellvax therapeutic product uses patents that regen biopharma has inlicensed from dr weiping min coupled with patents inlicensed from benitec biopharma  by utilizing methods covered in both of these patents regen biopharma hopes to develop an immunebased nontoxic cancer treatment initially targeting breast cancer hemaxellerate ii™ regen biopharma is currently in the preclinical stage of development for hemaxellerate ii hemaxellerate ii is intended to be a universal donor endothelial cell based therapeutic and is intended to be manufactured by obtaining cells from a part of the placenta called the “vascular lobules” the cells are processed and utilized for the purpose of stimulating bone marrow hematopoetic stem cell repair and proliferation the mechanism of action for hemaxellerate ii is similar to hemaxellerate i whereby the harvested and processed cells would produce growth factors which would mediate the therapeutic effects of the product   managent team  regen biopharma   david r koos phd dba chairman and

tacere therapeutics acquired the rights to the hcv family of drugs and brought back dr suhy to head the program partnered with pfizer shortly thereafter this drug is their first foray into gene therapybased approaches and is the first shrna program partnered with a large pharma given pfizer’s lack of experience in both areas dr suhy has played a pivotal role in its development as tacere has continued to lead the research efforts for advancement of this product into the clinic and has stood sidebyside with pfizer through all of the regulatory agency meetings     current business partners

biopharma announces dcellvax breast cancer immunotherapeutic product tweet   am san diego camarketwired  september    biomatrix scientific group inc otcqb bmsn announced today that its regen biopharma subsidiary is currently developing research plans for its breast cancer immunotherapeutic product dcellvax this cell therapy is based on patent   obtained from dr weiping min of the university of western ontario as well as an international patent portfolio licensed from benitech biopharma ltd the dcellvax therapeutic product is based on extracting blood from patients growing a specialized type of immune cell from the blood called the dendritic cell and then subsequently genetically modifying the dendritic cell to become resistant to cancers immune suppressive activity it is known that cancer modifies the immune system by producing proteins which result in immune suppression one such protein which cancer stimulates is an enzyme indolamine  deoxygenase ido which cancer turns on in dendritic cells while dendritic cells are usually immune stimulators dendritic cells found in cancer patients suppress the immune system as a result of expressing ido researchers at the university of western ontario led by dr weiping min have demonstrated that using a genetic blockade of ido in dendritic cells makes them resistant to the effects of cancer and allows them to stimulate potent immune responses against tumors the use of these modified dendritic cells has been previously demonstrated and published in peerreviewed journals in the melanoma and breast cancer mouse models regen is currently working with the contract research organization cro biorasi llc together with dr weiping mins group at manufacturing human dcellvax additionally the recruitment of david suhy phd from benitecs subsidiary tacera to regens scientific advisory board will provide inhouse clinical translation experience in the area of genetic based therapies dr suhy was essential in the development of

jan    regen biopharma a wholly owned subsidiary of biomatrix scientific group inc pinksheets bmsn announced today publication in a peer reviewed medical journal the scientific basis for its hemaxellerate™ bone marrow failure product the manuscript is available at httpwwwtranslationalmedicinecomcontentpdfpdf the publication is an overview of the investigational new drug ind application that the company plans to file for initiating clinical trials hemaxellerate™ is a cell therapy product developed by regen biopharma that uses fat derived from the patient as a source of healing cells to stimulate bone marrow production of blood cells these healing cells are termed endothelial cells and are a critical component of the blood production machinery of the bone marrow that is damaged in patients with bone marrow failure intellectual property covering the hemaxellerate™ product include us provisional patent applications   acceleration of hematopoietic reconstitution by placental endothelial and endothelial progenitor cells and   treatment of hematopoietic disorders filed by regen as well as an option to exclusively license issued us patent  currently the only way to stimulate production of blood from bone marrow is through administration of growth factors the overall market for growth factors is  billion per year unfortunately growth factors require repeated administration are expensive and in many patients are ineffective treatments available today for patients with insufficient bone marrow function are a bandaid solution that require repeated administration and do not address the underlying cause of bone marrow failure said david koos chairman and ceo of biomatrix and a coauthor of the publication we believe that hemaxellerate™ offers the possibility to actually heal damage that has occurred to the bone marrow and thus more naturally treat the core of cause of bone marrow inactivity the publication contained data obtained from independent laboratories supporting the use of hemaxellerate™ as an alternative to growth factor therapy and was a coauthored by stem cell pioneers dr amit patel from university of utah and dr michael murphy from indiana university additionally the paper was coauthored by companies working in the field of stem cells including cook biotechnology and medistem inc regen biopharmas first indication of hemaxellerate™ will be patients with aplastic anemia who are drug resistant and not eligible for bone marrow transplantation demonstration of efficacy in this patient population is anticipated to lead the way for entry
