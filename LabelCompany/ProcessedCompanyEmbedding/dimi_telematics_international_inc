new kid on the mm block growing over  in  with nearly  million in working capital dimi telematics international incs target date to go commercial with its unique cloudbased dimispeaks software and communications platform is early  dimis initial focus will be on property management companies other key sectors like education health care and the military will be targeted too entrepreneur roberto fata believes mm machinesto machines internet will be the largest most profound technology revolution of our lifetime it has limitless potential for transforming how people and companies remotely track monitor manage and protect multiple fixed and mobile assets in their supply chain and develop cost savings in realtime from anywhere on earth hardware indifferent dimi is the missing piece of the cloud mm computing puzzle says fata we intend to lead the charge by robert j flaherty and arnaldo arroyo in this issue we are featuring dimi telematics international otcqbdimi a developmentstage software startup dimi is currently in the process of completing and honing the latest version of its cloudbased mm proprietary business intelligence communications platform to go commercial in the first quarter of  what promises to give dimis technology platform a strong competitive edge is that it is hardware indifferent that edge is what its creator believes makes dimi the only technology that captures and integrates realtime data from virtually all of the standard networked control systems sensors and devices through use of a pc laptop or mobile phone dimi speaks software and dimi platform will enable the end user in a very costeffective way to monitor and control multiple fixed facilities and mobile assets remotely from anywhere in the world in real time dimis solution is currently being used to actively monitor property management systems in seven of the fata familys commercial and residential buildings in east harlem ny  all beta sites which have served to successfully prove the technology and mm communications platform dimi has also successfully worked out all of the bugs from previous versions of dimi dimmi means tell me in italian right now programmers are in the process of developing the dimi  version besides making the control console more attractive the upgrade will provide a number of technological advancements as well as voiceovertheinternet protocol two new apps are being added commercial launch is anticipated in the first quarter of  the company has filed for patent protection in the us as well as  other countries this dimispeaks startup appears to be in the right place at the right time the global market for mm should soar from  billion in  five fold to  billion in  according to focal point consulting group beecham research reports that service enablement services like dimispeaks software and dimi hosting are set to become a key differentiator in the machinetomachine mm market and achieve a total market value of  billion worldwide by   up from just  million in  jupiter research forecasts that new service revenues across industries including energy automotive transport and healthcare will top  billion by  according to gsma an industry association representing the interests of over  mobile operators worldwide there will be a connected universe of up to  billion mm devices developed over the next  years dumb devices which are not networked will rapidly decrease in value and new dumb models will be more difficult to market consequently this will create even greater pressure to make buildings and devices smarter and to be connected online the race is on to develop the software systems which will make this meteoric growth happen dimis proprietary mm solutions utilize a cloudbased twoway wireless communication delivery platform marketed as dimi leveraging the power  scalability and flexibility turnkey advantages of dimis patentpending software and hosting dimi platform  users are able to remotely track  monitor  manage and protect multiple mobile and fixed assets in realtime from virtually any webbased computer or mobile device located anywhere in the world dimi features a robust customized interface that gives its users secure command and control functionality of multiple remote connected sensors alarms and diagnostic devices the intuitive dimi framework readily adapts to and integrates both new and legacy monitoringsensing equipmentirrespective of make model or manufacturer providing for simplified economical mm deployments dimi is delivered as a monthly hosted service that puts critical information into the palm of its users hands with no major hardware investments dimis hosting platform can be tailored for each customer to create secure and reliable endtoend connectivity between their specific remote connected equipment and dimis proprietary web interface since the hosting platform is cloudbased dimis ability to help property managers lower their it infrastructure costs and management requirements will make the dimi communications platform more commercially attractive what will separate dimi from other companies in its property management technology niche is that its mm communications platform is hardware indifferent what this term basically means is that regardless of the type of hardware system that a property management company is now using they can all be operated monitored and controlled over the dimi platform this is a big selling point considering that current systems on the market such as crestron lutron and elk security among others can only be operated and controlled over their own individual platforms this is what makes dimi different than anything else all the other systems work only with their own devices says roberto fata who is cofounder executive vice president and creator of the dimi technology were softwarebased so were indifferent to what your hardware is as long as it can communicate we can make your lighting system talk to your car key access system talk to your air conditioning heating system talk to water sensors talk to all sorts of different systems whats more the dimi system is user friendly if you can text you can use dimi because this property manager has been tinkering with dimi since  fatas system has a surprisingly broad menu of what can be monitored and controlled from his portable ipad as he walks along he is especially proud of how proper access and some other activities by cleaning people vendors and importantly former employees can be monitored current employees or students also can be monitored to see when they arrive or leave or fail to show up while the companys initial marketing efforts naturally will focus on the commercial and residential property management sectors dimi plans to expand its commercial efforts to include a number of other key economic sectors such as government and military installations industrial facilities retail and restaurant chains colleges and universities fleet managers and any business or institutional concern with valuable fixed and mobile assets requiring remote surveillance regular maintenance or general oversight roberto has four dynamite ideas to apply to healthcare but doesnt dare be more specific for competitive reasons why give potential copycats a head start to achieve strong accelerated market penetration and sustainable revenue from a global customer base dimi will adopt a hybrid sales and marketing model it will involve strategy to include direct sales solutions teams channel sales through leading valueadded resellers and distributors dedicated to niche applications that dimi is capable of addressing and strategic marketing and integration collaborations with industry leading system integrators original equipment manufacturers and large cellular carriers and dealers necessity is indeed the mother of invention being a new york city property manager tied fata down but he still desperately wanted and needed to travel to race cars for ferrari in the north american challenge series so he designed his dimi to enable him to remotely access control and monitor any aspect of his private houses as well as seven of the commercial buildings his family owns in manhattan from his iphone blackberry desktop computer or laptop computer then he couldnt stop what he started in  he hired programmers to write the code for dimi since then he has spent over  million in the development of dimi  dimi  dimi  and the installation of sensors in seven of his buildings in east harlem and some of the familys residential properties in order to start getting the word out on dimi fata spent more than halfamillion dollars to be part of a large trade show at the jacob javits center in new york city for home building and property management technologies as a result of participating dimi continues to receive interest for its technology from commercial and residential property managers in chicago  california and around the us and also from abroad including dubai and moscow remote control and monitoring of ones property or assets is an area that is experiencing explosive growth within the mm global market that is why it is an area of significant emphasis for dimi by using mm communications a building of nearly any size can have its lighting air conditioning heating and access systems remotely monitored and controlled by management or a designated user from virtually anywhere in the world using a device as simple as a smartphone in fact when fata first installed dimi in several of his properties in mid he began to see significant annual cost and energy savings the following two examples illustrate how much cash and energy fata was able to save just from the initial installation  in two of fatas properties room temperature sensors were installed to identify specific heat load loss and window position sensors were installed to identify open windows he also replaced heat timers with demandbased heating as a consequence of dimis remote monitoring and control capabilities oil consumption dropped by up to  in the first year resulting in annual cost savings of  per building in one building we learned we were baking the tenants roberto fata recalls the average temperature in one building was  degrees in the winter of  everyone had their windows open with the help of sensors we adjusted the temperature all the windows closed and our heating costs normalized  it is general practice and often required by city code to install drip pans wherever water condensation or moisture buildup may collect in a building overlooked water overflows from these drip pans routinely caused damage to lower floors and tenant spaces costing the fata organization an estimated  per year per building for repairs and rent interruption compensation paid to inconvenienced tenants to combat this water sensors were installed in all drip pan and surrounding areas in the event of a water leak dimialerted the building superintendent through his smartphone who then immediately reacted by emptying the drip pan before damages occurred aside from the cost saving benefits the fata saw improved tenant satisfaction and annual retention rates increased fata claims that there isnt any technology on the market today that can integrate the three most widely used monitoring systems in smart buildings bacnet lontalk and smartbus he plans to change that we are developing an app that will allow us to speak to the smartbus world the bacnet world and the lontalk world he says right there that is  of automation so we can walk into almost any existing facility and plug into say the bacnet module and read everything that is already connected and programmed in their system and populate the dimi server up in the cloud now that the end user will have the ability to create rules create custom reports as to what they want to see today theyre limited by their present system once all of the systems and data are integrated in the cloud the property owner manager or designated end user will have around the clock access to all of the information and be able to remotely control all of the systems from anywhere in the world on an online command and control dashboard through the secure dimi internet portal in new york new legislation will go into effect august  which fata believes will create a great marketing opportunity for the dimi system right in his own backyard any commercial building in new york with over  square feet of space will be required to have some kind of smart technology to monitor efficiencies such as water and electricity and to report that data to the city government right now there are  commercial buildings on the island of manhattan alone he says hows that for opportunity a management team with a strong background in commercial and residential property management barry tenzer  who is cofounder president and ceo has more than  years handson experience founding managing andor serving as a board member of numerous private and public companies operating in a broad range of industries including real estate property management construction legal services commercial packaging cemetery auto sales and chartered aviation services just to name a few he was general partner of  madison avenue company ny lp and no th st company lp

president and ceo of motorcars auto group inc a company engaged in the ownership and operation of exotic high performance car dealerships and auto accessory businesses a veteran of the us air force tenzer graduated from cornell university with a bachelor of arts degree and earned a law degree llb from new york university he was admitted to the new york bar association in  and practiced law at the prominent new yorkbased tenzer greenblatt pa where his father congressman herbert tenzer was a founding partner tenzers real estate contacts should be invaluable to open doors for new sales roberto fata  is cofounder and executive vice president of business development since  fata has risen through the ranks of the family business fata organization a new york citybased real estate company that has owned and managed commercial and residential properties in manhattan for over  years as the firms president he has played a leadership role in the revitalization of harlem manhattans most famous neighborhood and currently serves on the board of directors for both the greater harlem board of realtors and the th street business improvement district in  he founded dimi pa inc to commercialize dimispeaks a facility management software and hosting solution that he developed to better manage the many building operating systems that supported all of the fata organizations real estate properties in  fata sold the assets of dimi pa to dimi telematics and is currently providing counsel and oversight to the companys management team as it prepares to take the dimi mm communications solution to market in the first quarter of  fata earned bachelor degrees in both real estate and finance from the university of miami he completed the negotiations program at harvard university  john f kennedy school of government in  he was named the ferrari challenge champion of the north american race series lyle hauser  is cofounder and the largest shareholder of dimi he is not an officer or director but serves as an advisor to management on business development hauser is chairman and ceo of vantage group ltd a private equity firm with a specialized business consultancy serving early stage companies vantage groups primary investment strategy is focused on providing capital and professional managerial guidance to select high growth companies in a broad range of industries since  hauser has advised and consulted many private and public companies on capital structure debt financing mergers and acquisitions capital formation and reverse merger transactions finance as a development stage software startup dimi telematics international has not generated any revenue and as a startup shares all the upside potential and downside perils of being a new company with net working capital of nearly million and no debt dimi has sufficient cash to complete the upgrade of dimi  technology which is estimated to cost  as of february   dimi had cash and cash equivalents of  and a net working capital of  dimi boasts a very low internal cash burn and can be considered to be in what venture capitalists call the incubator period for example none of the executive officers currently receives a salary from the company they all work for equity and since dimi is based in one of the fata familys manhattan locations there is no office rent specifically associated with the daytoday operations of dimi naturally after the prototype passes muster dimi will need to raise more capital as it ramps up to go commercial in the first quarter of  this will require a major funding effort to raise as much as  million after its second recent  for  forward stock split total shares outstanding now are around  million adjusted for a give back to the company treasury to be retired of  million shares by cofounder lyle hauser on june   in exchange dimi issue hauser  shares of preferred stock which will be returned to dimi at the option of hauser the consideration would be  million common shares if dimis earnings per share for its fiscal year ended august   are less than  and no consideration if dimi earnings are higher this important share give back resulted in a reduction in shares outstanding of  commenting barry tenzer president and ceo of dimi stated the exchange and retirement of these common shares is viewed by our management team as a very positive step toward improving our companys overall capital structure and enhancing value for both our new and existing shareholders moreover lyles decision to enter into this share exchange represents a muchappreciated vote of confidence in dimis exciting business plan and positions us well to implement our strategic growth initiatives in  and beyond trading in may and june was only a few thousand shares but it exploded on june  to  million shares on that volatile day the stock price of dimi ranged between a high of  to a low of  and closed at  at the close of june th and adjusting shares outstanding for the  million share give back to  million total stock market capitalization is  million the float is about  million shares history in the winter of  roberto fata succeeded in making his then yearold father eugene fata then head of the fata organization a believer in technologies gene really did not understand such as sensors and computers a delightful new york times story of october   a landlord learns from his son described how roberto showed his father that by installing sensors in each of his properties he no longer had to go from building to building with a piece of paper and pencil in order to monitor his each one he could monitor his properties remotely by using a computer or mobile phone that year roberto installed water sensors to show when toilets were backing up temperature sensors in every living room and oil sensors to provide evidence if a delivery was  gallons short roberto who discovered that he had a talent for tinkering with things when he was a child saw the enormous costsavings potential that could be generated by the sensors that he developed a webbased system around the sensors and called it dimi dimmi means tell me in italian he developed the dimi solution so that its able to capture and integrate realtime data from virtually all of the standard networked control systems sensors and devices the dimi solution is now actively monitoring property management systems in seven of fatas commercial and residential buildings in east harlem ny  all beta sites which have served to successfully prove the technology and mm communications platform fata family private residences elsewhere are also being monitored with good results recognizing the enormous global market potential for dimi fata and an old college friend lyle hauser chairman and ceo of a private equity firm vantage group ltd formed dimi telematics in november  the company went public by backing into a shell company first quantum ventures inc on march   the entity changed its name to dimi telematics international inc in april the company executed a forward  for  stock split and trading commenced on the pink sheets under the symbol dimipk in may dimi executed a second  for  forward stock split to increase the float to  million shares on june th as we go to press lyle hauser returned  million of his founders shares to the company treasury reducing estimated shares outstanding to around  million see finance section for a description of this transaction currently the dimi product and software is being styled to go commercial in the first quarter of  when dimi will shift into gear competition dimi boasts that it is uniquely hardware indifferent this will separate it from the crowd and enable dimi to integrate many rival platforms on to dimis cloudbased businesses that share the mm space can be viewed as competitors these include mm application service providers mobile virtual network operators system integrators and wireless operatorscarriers that offer a variety of the components and services required for the delivery of complete mm solutions also because the growth of mm is so meteoric many new entries are sure to jump in risks as a development stage startup dimi faces all the perils of being new boasting the only cloudbased mm software technology which can integrate the most widely used property management devices dimi has a great opportunity to make a substantial inroads in the commercial property management space and enhance the companys valuation however once the dimi system reaches the commercial stage dimi will have to raise perhaps as much as  million in order to staff up and hit the ground running timing is important theres always the chance that another mm company thats better financed and that operates in the property management space may develop its own superior cloudbased software technology whats more although dimi is a proven technology in the fata properties the technologys real test will come when the platform goes commercial old timers always warn that a new company is a concept company until outsiders buy the product reorder or renew and the company becomes profitable in a startup where a dream is being turned into a reality the future never evolves exactly as expected the rubber really hits the road when the unexpected happens then management must react positively
