release   berkshire hathaway inc general re corporation  kiewit plaza financial centre omaha ne  stamford connecticut    berkshire hathaway inc and general re corporation to merge   omaha nebraska and stamford connecticut june    berkshire hathaway inc and general re corporation announced today that they have reached a definitive agreement to merge under the agreement general re shareholders will have the option at closing of accepting either  class a shares or  class b shares of berkshire the transaction is expected to be taxfree to general re shareholders based on thursdays closing prices the value of the consideration to be received by general re shareholders is approximately  per general re share the total consideration for the transaction will be approximately  billion the merger will be accounted for by berkshire as a purchase pro forma for the transaction berkshire would have had gaap net worth of approximately  billion as of march   the highest of any company in the united states and a market capitalization today of approximately  billion ron ferguson chairman and chief executive officer of general re will join berkshires board of directors general re will operate independently of berkshires other insurance and reinsurance operations it is anticipated that the transaction which is subject among other things to regulatory approvals and the approvals of the two companies shareholders will be completed in the fourth quarter under the terms of the agreement general re has agreed to grant berkshire options to purchase subject to certain terms up to  of the outstanding general re shares at the transaction price subject to a cash limit of  of the aggregate consideration warren buffett chairman of berkshire commented the merger will bring more than  of investments to berkshire for each class a or class aequivalent share issued thats beneficial being nearly double the existing level or put another way the merger brings more than  billion of additional investments to berkshire but the main attraction of the merger is synergy a word that heretofore has never been used in listing the reasons for a berkshire acquisition in this transaction however there are at least four areas of powerful synergy which charles munger berkshires vice chairman and i believe justify the premium price that berkshire is paying first this transaction removes constraints on earnings volatility that have caused general re in the past to decline certain attractive business and in other cases to lay off substantial amounts of the business that it does write because of both its status as a public company and its desire to maintain its aaa credit rating general re has understandably been unable to operate in a manner that could produce large swings in reported earnings as part of berkshire this constraint will disappear which will enhance both general res longterm profitability and its ability to write more business furthermore general re will be free to reduce its reliance on the retrocessional market over time and thereby have substantial additional funds available for investment second general re has substantial opportunities to develop its global reinsurance franchise as part of berkshire general re will be able to make investments to grow its international business as quickly as it sees fit additionally general re will gain tax flexibility as a result of the merger in managing insurance investments it is a distinct advantage to know that large amounts of taxable income will consistently recur most insurance companies are in no position to make this assumption any berkshire insurance subsidiary can fashion its investment strategy without worry as to the presence of taxable income in the future due to berkshires large and diverse streams of taxable income finally berkshires insurance subsidiaries never need to worry about having abundant capital therefore they can follow whatever asset strategy makes the most sense unconstrained by the effect on the capital of the company of a sharp market decline periodically this flexibility has proven of enormous advantage to berkshires insurance subsidiaries these synergies will be coupled with general res pristine worldwide reputation longstanding client relationships and powerful underwriting risk management and distribution capabilities this combination virtually assures both berkshire and general re shareholders that they will have a better future than if the two companies operated separately ron ferguson stated i am very enthusiastic about our merger with berkshire the combined entity is a unique and extraordinary business model that provides us with the longterm commitment the financial resources and the optimal platform to serve our clients and thus grow our franchise general res future has never been brighter         berkshire is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities the most important of these is the property and casualty insurance business conducted on both a direct and reinsurance basis through a number of subsidiaries         general re corporation is a holding company for global
