results for periods under one year are short  term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of the fund over varying market conditions or economic cycles risk considerations investors should consider the following risk factors and special considerations associated with investing in the fund which may cause you to lose money including the entire principal amount that you invest equity risk the value of the equity securities held by the fund will fall due to general market and economic conditions perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers of securities held by the fund participate or factors relating to specific companies in which the fund invests solar energy industry risk prices of energy including traditional sources of energy such as oil gas or electricity or alternative energy may decline the alternative energy industry can be significantly affected by obsolescence of existing technology short product lifecycles falling prices and profits competition from new market entrants and general economic conditions this industry can also be significantly affected by fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of alternative energy fuels energy conservation the success of exploration projects and tax and other government regulations and policies companies in this industry could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility imposition of import controls increased competition depletion of resources technological developments and labor relations the solar energy industry has experienced an industrywide shortage of polysilicon which may place constraints on the revenue growth of solar energy companies and decrease such companies’ productivity solar energy companies may not be able to secure an adequate and costeffective supply of solar wafers cells or reclaimable silicon if government subsidies and economic incentives for solar power are reduced or eliminated the demand for solar energy may decline and cause corresponding declines in the revenues and profits of solar energy companies existing regulations and policies and changes to such regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products thus reducing demand for such products if solar power technology is not suitable for widespread adoption or sufficient demand for solar power products does not develop or takes long periods of time to develop the revenues of solar power companies may decline foreign investment risk the fund’s investments in nonus issuers although generally limited to adrs may involve unique risks compared to investing in securities of us issuers including less market liquidity generally greater market volatility than us securities and less complete financial information than for us issuers small and mediumsized company risk investing in securities of small and mediumsized companies involves greater risk than is customarily associated with investing in larger more established companies microcap company risk microcap stocks involve substantially greater risks of loss and price fluctuations because their earnings and revenues tend to be less predictable and some companies may be experiencing significant losses and their share prices tend to be more volatile and their markets less liquid than companies with larger market capitalizations concentration risk if the index concentrates in an industry or group of industries the fund’s investments will be concentrated accordingly in such event the value of the fund’s shares may rise and fall more than the value of shares of a fund that invests in securities of companies in a broader range of industries in addition the funds are subject to noncorrelation risk replication management risk issuerspecific changes and non diversified fund risk please read the prospectus for more detailed information regarding these and other risks fund data is subject to change
