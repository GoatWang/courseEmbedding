photograph in writing exercises the software provides an onscreen keyboard for the user to type characters that are not in the latin alphabet grammar lessons cover grammatical tense and grammatical mood in grammar lessons the program firstly shows the learner several examples of a grammatical concept and in some levels the word or words the learner should focus on are highlighted then the learner is given a sentence with several options for a word or phrase and the student chooses the correct option if the student has a microphone the software can attempt to evaluate word pronunciation

turns green but the screen number itself turns orange if all answers for a screen are wrong the button turns orange this applies to all lessons except review and milestone lessons which are treated as tests in those lessons the buttons for each screen all remain brown in all lessons there is a button in the bottomright of the window which can be hovered over to display how many answers are correct wrong or have not been answered each time an answer is clicked one point is given at the end of the lesson the total number of correct wrong or skipped answers is shown alongside the percentage of correct answers for that lesson if too many questions were answered incorrectly the program suggests the learner should retry the lesson software versionsedit to use rosetta stone language learning a

to customize language learning content to preserve and introduce the chickasaw language to its  members worldwide this effort comes as the chickasaw nation has approximately  native speakers remaining with its last monolingual speaker having died in  reception and efficacyedit critiques from language expertsedit frequent criticism of the program arises in its lack of sensitivity to the differences between the various languages it comes in and their respective cultures early versions of the software presented the same concepts in the same order using the same images taken mostly in the washington dc area near the companys headquarters at the time in harrisonburg virginia in the most recent version there have been some modifications to the picture set for certain languages or regions another frequent issue was the use of more formal vocabulary than that regularly used by native speakers in  macworld reviewer cyrus farivar noted that his persian cd used khodrow for car although most native speakers use a french loanword masheen the same course did not teach words that would be important to someone learning persian such as bread and tea however it very curiously included the word elephant in a basic vocabulary lesson perplexed by the question of why the word elephant would be taught in a language where it might never be used there are not many elephants in iran farivar called rosetta stone inc he was told that the company makes four different picture sets one for western languages another for asian languages and two sets unique to each swahili and latin the persian language cd was using the western picture set which explains why the images were not culturally relevant donald mcrae on the german courseedit writing in  donald mcrae of brock university said that rosetta stone represented good pedagogy and that the authors of the program never lose sight of solid teaching methodology he described the version  german language course as very good but indicated that he had some reservationsfurther explanation needed mark kaiser on the russian courseedit in a  review of the version  russian language course mark kaiser director of the language media center at the university of california berkeley called the program woefully inadequate for a number of reasons one of kaisers observations was that rosetta stone software fails to provide a relevant cultural context because the company uses the same stock photographs for all its language courses they depict people activities and manufactured goods that are conspicuously american kaiser also found that rosetta stone version  does not provide a way for students to evaluate their conversation skills and that some of the words and phrases are too englishbased the entire package lacks any pedagogical foundation he concluded rather it utilizes the glitz of the multimedia capabilities of the computer a dearth of quality foreign language software and clever marketing to create an economically successful productdead link brendan lewis a world traveler made similar observations in his critique nearly  years later stephen krashens reviewedit the languagelearning specialist stephen krashen found that the few studies on the software produced learning results that were about as effective as traditional instruction on traditional tests end user license agreementedit the user purchases a

images the number of images per screen varies for example the software shows the student four photographs a native speaker makes a statement that describes one of the photographs and the statement is printed on the screen the student chooses the photograph that the speaker described in another variation the student completes a textual description of a photograph in writing exercises the software provides an onscreen keyboard for the user to type characters that are not in the latin alphabet grammar lessons cover grammatical tense and grammatical mood in grammar lessons the program firstly shows the learner several examples of a grammatical concept and in some levels the word or words the learner should focus on are highlighted then the learner is given a sentence with several options for a word or phrase and the student chooses the correct option if the student has a microphone the software can attempt to evaluate word pronunciation each lesson concludes with a review of the content in that lesson and each unit concludes with a milestone which is a simulated conversation that includes the content of the unit scoringedit the program immediately informs whether the answer is right or wrong through the preferences screen the student can choose whether a sound is played or not when an answer is clicked at the bottom of the window the program shows all the screens for the current lesson if all answers for that screen are correct the button for that screen turns green if some answers are correct the border of the button turns green but the screen number itself turns orange if all answers for a screen are wrong the button turns orange this applies to all lessons except review and milestone lessons which are treated as tests in those lessons the buttons for each screen all remain brown in all lessons there is a button in the bottomright of the window which can be hovered over to display how many answers are correct wrong or have not been answered each time an answer is clicked one point is given at the end of the lesson the total number of correct wrong or skipped answers is shown alongside the percentage of correct answers for that lesson if too many questions were answered incorrectly the program suggests the learner should retry the lesson software versionsedit to use rosetta stone language learning a student needs the rosetta stone application

content to preserve and introduce the chickasaw language to its  members worldwide this effort comes as the chickasaw nation has approximately  native speakers remaining with its last monolingual speaker having died in  reception and efficacyedit critiques from language expertsedit frequent criticism of the program arises in its lack of sensitivity to the differences between the various languages it comes in and their respective cultures early versions of the software presented the same concepts in the same order using the same images taken mostly in the washington dc area near the companys headquarters at the time in harrisonburg virginia in the most recent version there have been some modifications to the picture set for certain languages or regions another frequent issue was the use of more formal vocabulary than that regularly used by native speakers in  macworld reviewer cyrus farivar noted that his persian cd used khodrow for car although most native speakers use a french loanword masheen the same course did not teach words that would be important to someone learning persian such as bread and tea however it very curiously included the word elephant in a basic vocabulary lesson perplexed by the question of why the word elephant would be taught in a language where it might never be used there are not many elephants in iran farivar called rosetta stone inc he was told that the company makes four different picture sets one for western languages another for asian languages and two sets unique to each swahili and latin the persian language cd was using the western picture set which explains why the images were not culturally relevant donald mcrae on the german courseedit writing in  donald mcrae of brock university said that rosetta stone represented good pedagogy and that the authors of the program never lose sight of solid teaching methodology he described the version  german language course as very good but indicated that he had some reservationsfurther explanation needed mark kaiser on the russian courseedit in a  review of the version  russian language course mark kaiser director of the language media center at the university of california berkeley called the program woefully inadequate for a number of reasons one of kaisers observations was that rosetta stone software fails to provide a relevant cultural context because the company uses the same stock photographs for all its language courses they depict people activities and manufactured goods that are conspicuously american kaiser also found that rosetta stone version  does not provide a way for students to evaluate their conversation skills and that some of the words and phrases are too englishbased the entire package lacks any pedagogical foundation he concluded rather it utilizes the glitz of the multimedia capabilities of the computer a dearth of quality foreign language software and clever marketing to create an economically successful productdead link brendan lewis a world traveler made similar observations in his critique nearly  years later stephen krashens reviewedit the languagelearning specialist stephen krashen found that the few studies on the software produced learning results that were about as effective as traditional instruction on traditional tests end user license agreementedit the user purchases a licence to use the software

communities engaged in language revitalization organizations that contract the endangered language program to develop custom software own the sales and distribution rights over their final product allowing communities control over this language resource and respecting indigenous intellectual property rights these versions are thus not marketed via the usual outlets such as bookstores or commercial websites based in harrisonburg virginia the endangered language program began offering a corporate grant program in  to underwrite development costs for awarded communities rosetta stone

to customize language learning content to preserve and introduce the chickasaw language to its  members worldwide this effort comes as the chickasaw nation has approximately  native speakers remaining with its last monolingual speaker having died in  reception and efficacyedit critiques from language expertsedit frequent criticism of the program arises in its lack of sensitivity to the differences between the various languages it comes in and their respective cultures early versions of the software presented the same concepts in the same order using the same images taken mostly in the washington dc area near the companys headquarters at the time in harrisonburg virginia in the most recent version there have been some modifications to the picture set for certain languages or regions another frequent issue was the use of more formal vocabulary than that regularly used by native speakers in  macworld reviewer cyrus farivar noted that his persian cd used khodrow for car although most native speakers use a french loanword masheen the same course did not teach words that would be important to someone learning persian such as bread and tea however it very curiously included the word elephant in a basic vocabulary lesson perplexed by the question of why the word elephant would be taught in a language where it might never be used there are not many elephants in iran farivar called rosetta stone inc he was told that the company makes four different picture sets one for western languages another for asian languages and two sets unique to each swahili and latin the persian language cd was using the western picture set which explains why the images were not culturally relevant donald mcrae on the german courseedit writing in  donald mcrae of brock university said that rosetta stone represented good pedagogy and that the authors of the program never lose sight of solid teaching methodology he described the version  german language course as very good but indicated that he had some reservationsfurther explanation needed mark kaiser on the russian courseedit in a  review of the version  russian language course mark kaiser director of the language media center at the university of california berkeley called the program woefully inadequate for a number of reasons one of kaisers observations was that rosetta stone software fails to provide a relevant cultural context because the company uses the same stock photographs for all its language courses they depict people activities and manufactured goods that are conspicuously american kaiser also found that rosetta stone version  does not provide a way for students to evaluate their conversation skills and that some of the words and phrases are too englishbased the entire package lacks any pedagogical foundation he concluded rather it utilizes the glitz of the multimedia capabilities of the computer a dearth of quality foreign language software and clever marketing to create an economically successful productdead link brendan lewis a world traveler made similar observations in his critique nearly  years later stephen krashens reviewedit the languagelearning specialist stephen krashen found that the few studies on the software produced learning results that were about as effective as traditional instruction on traditional tests end user license agreementedit the user purchases a

pairs sound or text to one of several images the number of images per screen varies for example the software shows the student four photographs a native speaker makes a statement that describes one of the photographs and the statement is printed on the screen the student chooses the photograph that the speaker described in another variation the student completes a textual description of a photograph in writing exercises the software provides an onscreen keyboard for the user to type characters that are not in the latin alphabet grammar lessons cover grammatical tense and grammatical mood in grammar lessons the program firstly shows the learner several examples of a grammatical concept and in some levels the word or words the learner should focus on are highlighted then the learner is given a sentence with several options for a word or phrase and the student chooses the correct option if the student has a microphone the software can attempt to evaluate word pronunciation each lesson concludes with a review of the content in that lesson and each unit concludes with a milestone which is a simulated conversation that includes the content of the unit scoringedit the program immediately informs whether the answer is right or wrong through the preferences screen the student can choose whether a sound is played or not when an answer is clicked at the bottom of the window the program shows all the screens for the current lesson if all answers for that screen are correct the button for that screen turns green if some answers are correct the border of the button turns green but the screen number itself turns orange if all answers for a screen are wrong the button turns orange this applies to all lessons except review and milestone lessons which are treated as tests in those lessons the buttons for each screen all remain brown in all lessons there is a button in the bottomright of the window which can be hovered over to display how many answers are correct wrong or have not been answered each time an answer is clicked one point is given at the end of the lesson the total number of correct wrong or skipped answers is shown alongside the percentage of correct answers for that lesson if too many questions were answered incorrectly the program suggests the learner should retry the lesson software versionsedit to use rosetta stone language learning a

commercial websites based in harrisonburg virginia the endangered language program began offering a corporate grant program in  to underwrite development costs for awarded communities rosetta stone

to customize language learning content to preserve and introduce the chickasaw language to its  members worldwide this effort comes as the chickasaw nation has approximately  native speakers remaining with its last monolingual speaker having died in  reception and efficacyedit critiques from language expertsedit frequent criticism of the program arises in its lack of sensitivity to the differences between the various languages it comes in and their respective cultures early versions of the software presented the same concepts in the same order using the same images taken mostly in the washington dc area near the companys headquarters at the time in harrisonburg virginia in the most recent version there have been some modifications to the picture set for certain languages or regions another frequent issue was the use of more formal vocabulary than that regularly used by native speakers in  macworld reviewer cyrus farivar noted that his persian cd used khodrow for car although most native speakers use a french loanword masheen the same course did not teach words that would be important to someone learning persian such as bread and tea however it very curiously included the word elephant in a basic vocabulary lesson perplexed by the question of why the word elephant would be taught in a language where it might never be used there are not many elephants in iran farivar called rosetta stone inc he was told that the company makes four different picture sets one for western languages another for asian languages and two sets unique to each swahili and latin the persian language cd was using the western picture set which explains why the images were not culturally relevant donald mcrae on the german courseedit writing in  donald mcrae of brock university said that rosetta stone represented good pedagogy and that the authors of the program never lose sight of solid teaching methodology he described the version  german language course as very good but indicated that he had some reservationsfurther explanation needed mark kaiser on the russian courseedit in a  review of the version  russian language course mark kaiser director of the language media center at the university of california berkeley called the program woefully inadequate for a number of reasons one of kaisers observations was that rosetta stone software fails to provide a relevant cultural context because the company uses the same stock photographs for all its language courses they depict people activities and manufactured goods that are conspicuously american kaiser also found that rosetta stone version  does not provide a way for students to evaluate their conversation skills and that some of the words and phrases are too englishbased the entire package lacks any pedagogical foundation he concluded rather it utilizes the glitz of the multimedia capabilities of the computer a dearth of quality foreign language software and clever marketing to create an economically successful productdead link brendan lewis a world traveler made similar observations in his critique nearly  years later stephen krashens reviewedit the languagelearning specialist stephen krashen found that the few studies on the software produced learning results that were about as effective as traditional instruction on traditional tests end user license agreementedit the user purchases a

to customize language learning content to preserve and introduce the chickasaw language to its  members worldwide this effort comes as the chickasaw nation has approximately  native speakers remaining with its last monolingual speaker having died in  reception and efficacyedit critiques from language expertsedit frequent criticism of the program arises in its lack of sensitivity to the differences between the various languages it comes in and their respective cultures early versions of the software presented the same concepts in the same order using the same images taken mostly in the washington dc area near the companys headquarters at the time in harrisonburg virginia in the most recent version there have been some modifications to the picture set for certain languages or regions another frequent issue was the use of more formal vocabulary than that regularly used by native speakers in  macworld reviewer cyrus farivar noted that his persian cd used khodrow for car although most native speakers use a french loanword masheen the same course did not teach words that would be important to someone learning persian such as bread and tea however it very curiously included the word elephant in a basic vocabulary lesson perplexed by the question of why the word elephant would be taught in a language where it might never be used there are not many elephants in iran farivar called rosetta stone inc he was told that the company makes four different picture sets one for western languages another for asian languages and two sets unique to each swahili and latin the persian language cd was using the western picture set which explains why the images were not culturally relevant donald mcrae on the german courseedit writing in  donald mcrae of brock university said that rosetta stone represented good pedagogy and that the authors of the program never lose sight of solid teaching methodology he described the version  german language course as very good but indicated that he had some reservationsfurther explanation needed mark kaiser on the russian courseedit in a  review of the version  russian language course mark kaiser director of the language media center at the university of california berkeley called the program woefully inadequate for a number of reasons one of kaisers observations was that rosetta stone software fails to provide a relevant cultural context because the company uses the same stock photographs for all its language courses they depict people activities and manufactured goods that are conspicuously american kaiser also found that rosetta stone version  does not provide a way for students to evaluate their conversation skills and that some of the words and phrases are too englishbased the entire package lacks any pedagogical foundation he concluded rather it utilizes the glitz of the multimedia capabilities of the computer a dearth of quality foreign language software and clever marketing to create an economically successful productdead link brendan lewis a world traveler made similar observations in his critique nearly  years later stephen krashens reviewedit the languagelearning specialist stephen krashen found that the few studies on the software produced learning results that were about as effective as traditional instruction on traditional tests end user license agreementedit the user purchases a
