estonia where von baer spent his early childhood karl ernst von baer was born into a baltic german noble family in the piep estate kreis jerwen governorate of estonia in presentday lääneviru county estonia as a knight by birthright he spent his early childhood at lasila manor estonia many of his ancestors had come from westphalia he was educated at the knight and cathedral school in reval tallinn and the imperial university of dorpat tartu each of which he found lacking in quality education in  during his tenure at the university he was sent to riga to aid the city after napoleons armies had laid siege to it as he attempted to help the sick and wounded he realized that his education at dorpat had been inadequate and upon his graduation he notified his father that he would need to go abroad to finish his education in his autobiography his discontent with his education at dorpat inspired him to write a lengthy appraisal of education in general a summary that dominated the content of the book after leaving tartu he continued his education in berlin vienna and würzburg where ignaz döllinger introduced him to the new field of embryology in  he became a professor at königsberg university kaliningrad and full professor of zoology in  and of anatomy in  in  he taught briefly in st petersburg but returned to königsberg in  baer moved back to st petersburg and joined the st petersburg academy of sciences first in zoology – and then in comparative anatomy and physiology – his interests while there were anatomy ichthyology ethnography anthropology and geography while embryology had kept his attention in königsberg then in russia von baer engaged in a great deal of field research including the exploration of the island novaya zemlya the last years of his life – were spent in dorpat where he became a leading critic of charles darwin contributionsedit statue of karl ernst von baer on toome hill tartu as a tradition students wash the statues head with champagne every walpurgis night embryologyedit see also recapitulation theory von baer studied the embryonic development of animals discovering the blastula stage of development and the notochord together with heinz christian pander and based on the work by caspar friedrich wolff he described the germ layer theory of development ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm as a principle in a variety of species laying the foundation for comparative embryology in the book über entwickelungsgeschichte der thiere  in  baer discovered the mammalian ovum the human ovum was first described by edgar allen in  in  he completed research ovi mammalium et hominis genesi for st petersburgs academy of science published at leipzig in  von baer became the first person to observe human ova only in  did oscar hertwig prove that fertilization is due to fusion of an egg and sperm cell von baer formulated what became known as baers laws of embryology general characteristics of the group to which an embryo belongs develop before special characteristics general structural relations are likewise formed before the most specific appear the form of any given embryo does not converge upon other definite forms but separates itself from them the embryo of a higher animal form never resembles the adult of another animal form such as one less evolved but only its embryo evolutionedit from his studies of comparative embryology baer had believed in the transmutation of species but rejected later in his career the theory of natural selection proposed by charles darwin he produced an early phylogenetic tree revealing the ontogeny and phylogeny of vertebrate embryos in the fifth edition of on the origin of species published in  charles darwin added a historical sketch giving due credit to naturalists who had preceded him in publishing the opinion that species undergo modification and that the existing forms of life have descended by true generation from preexisting forms according to darwin von baer towards whom all zoologists feel so profound a respect expressed about the year  his conviction chiefly grounded on the laws of geographical distribution that forms now perfectly distinct have descended from a single parentform baer was also a believer in a teleological force in nature which has been compared to a form of evolutionary orthogenesis other sciencesedit k baer  the term baers law is also applied to the unconfirmed proposition that in the northern hemisphere erosion occurs mostly on the right banks of rivers and in the southern hemisphere on the left banks in its more thorough formulation which baer never formulated himself the erosion of rivers depends on the direction of flow as well for example in the northern hemisphere a section of river flowing in a northsouth direction according to the theory erodes on its right bank due to the coriolis effect while in an eastwest section there is no preference baer was interested in the northern part of russia and explored novaya zemlya in  collecting biological specimens other travels led him to the caspian sea the north cape and lapland he was one of the founders of the russian geographical society he was a pioneer in studying biological time – the perception of time in different organisms awards and distinctionsedit in  he was elected a foreign honorary of the american academy of arts and sciences he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in  he was the president of the estonian naturalists society in – and was a cofounder and first president of the russian

manor estonia and at the zoological museum in st petersburg russia before the estonian conversion to the euro the kroon bank note bore his portrait baer island in the kara sea was named after karl

decelarotors todays open wheel designs have made brakes a critical element in creating a finished performance appearance in answer baer developed decelarotors as premium oe replacement rotors with slotted crossdrilled and plated surfaces first crossdrilling then slotting originated from a need developed in the early days of disc brakes in road racing the purpose is to provide gasses that build up between the rotor and pad surface an exit path if left unaddressed the outgassing of pads generate a pneumatic barrier between the rotor and the pad effectively reducing friction and with it braking performance these gasses are generated when elements used in manufacturing pads reach extreme temperatures frequently experienced in racing todays compounds and burnishing techniques in manufacturing have largely eliminated the effects of outgassing in modern pads the engineers at porsche mercedes ferrari and others have this knowledge however racing appearance and heritage that is visually evident with crossdrilled rotors is a f inishing touch that delivers satisfying esthetics each hole drilled in a baer decelarotor is carefully located ventilated rotors this minimizes potential surface fissures cracks and maintains proper rotor balance some competitors imply or directly state slotting does not generate an increase in stress to the surface of the rotor like crossdrilling does this is simply not true any machine modification to rotor surfaces creates a stress riser baer backs decelarotor with the industries best warranty which itself is backed by baers  year reputation for delivering premium brake products to satisfied customers many also imply or state outright slotted or drilled rotors deliver significant performance stopping improvements quantifiable stopping improvements are generated from increasing brake torque increasing leverage larger dia rotors increased clamping force caliper upgrades or improving friction itself higher mu pad compound are the commonly accepted ways to attain bolton improvements in braking performance baers factual assessment of the features and benefits available from decelarotors include dynamic visual impact superior bite equalized pad wear consistent wet weather performance direct oe replacement proper counterrotational drill  slot pattern as used in proracing eliminates outgassing unprecedented threeyear limited warranty against warping  cracking decelapads are ceramic matrix pads benefits common to ceramics include low noise under dba light colored nonabrasive dust excellent response cold  hot highly temperature stable however decelapads stand out against competitive ceramics as the highestfriction level mu ceramic pad currently available in addition decelapads exhibit excellent onset bite smooth progressive modulation long pad life low rotor wear smooth quiet lower levels of light colored dust and friction levels rivaling european specification high carbon content compounds decelapads deliver when matched with decelarotors they are the perfect compliment of brilliant appearance and user friendly performance full floater problem traditional flangedaxles employ a single axlebearing and together they support the weight of the vehicle when corning the flangedaxle is levered by lateral forces axle deflection bowing or bending occurs as lateral forces rise with cornering speeds affects knock back results when the axle flange and the brake rotor to which it is attached deflect causing the rotor to knock the pad back displacing brake fluid in the caliper pistonss the driver must then pump the pedal to move the fluid back into the caliper and reestablish the firm brake pedal solution baers tracker full floating axle conversion though we didnt invent the floater we were the first to refine it for the protouring market this was built completely from the ground up for street cars and is  usa built some key features with our floater conversion compared to other common race pieces are much narrower footprint only  wider than our normal ford  brake system smaller register to fit street type wheels standard car patterns x and x first ever floater to incorporate park brake fully abs compatible for ford and gm configurations drive plates built by speedway engineering specifically for baer that uses a  spline arrangement based off the nascar specs our  spline drive plate is  larger than a standard  spline axle arp ½ x  race studs the tracker full floating axle conversion is purchased as an upgrade to a variety of our brake systems when the tracker is purchased it does not include any brake parts just the parts needed for the floater conversion the tracker will work with extreme  and  pro  and  ss  the floater snout has a flange machined into it to allow any of the above systems with late model big ford ends torino to bolt right to the snout once the snout is installed this is a complete bolt on you do not need to weld any brake brackets on the rear end if you have an existing brake system with a backing plate other than torino new plates will need to be ordered once the snout is installed this is a complete bolt on you do not need to weld any brake brackets on the rear end if you have an existing brake system with a backing plate other than torino new plates will need to be ordered here is an example of the difference in width of our tracker rear conversion compared to a traditional  rear brake system spacers cnc machined out of t aluminum available in a wide variety of thicknesses from  available in a wide variety of bolt patterns to cover many car and truck applications fully machined to ensure flat surface  stud holes not a universal slot hole patterns like many of the cheaper cast spacers  made in usa with us

conditions commonly called bump steer simple maneuvers such as hard braking cornering or traveling over roadsurface irregularities can cause the vehicle to dart in an unexpected direction baer trackers™ solve this problem the pinheightadjustable tie rods allow compensation for ride height and suspension geometry changes enabling a more optimal range of articulation between the tie rod and the steering arm steering geometry is optimized and bump steer is eradicated kits are listed for stock vehicle applications for modified vehicles go to builder components where individual pins and sleeves with dimensions are available to match your needs tracker tie rod complete kits changing a vehicles ride height causes changes in suspension caster angles which can dramatically affect steering instead of steering remaining stable and returning to center easily simple bumps in the road may cause your suspension to articulate differently than it was designed to front wheels may hop dramatically to the left or to the right as a result and ride quality can be compromised in both the front and rear baers tracker tie rod end joints compensate for ride height changes to allow more freedom of movement between your vehicles tie rods and steering arms because of the greater flexibility and range of articulation the end joints add optimal steering stability and control is restored

the field of embryology karl ernst von baer also pursued a variety of other areas of study including medicine botany zoology and anthropology committing his life to scientific research von baer’s work led to the advancement of the understanding of mammalian reproduction development and organ functioning his embryological discoveries ultimately led him to a view of development that supported epigenesis and refuted longheld thinking about preformation karl ernst von baer was born on  february  in piep estonia to first cousins juliane louise von baer and magnus johann von baer as one of ten children von baer spent his childhood in coburg with his father’s brother karl and his wife baroness ernestine von canne although his uncle and father encouraged military life von baer chose to attend the university of dorpat where he began medical studies in august  at dorpat von baer studied botany physics and physiology and was influenced by professor of physiology karl friedrich burdach after completing his md degree in september  von baer traveled to berlin and vienna to continue his education in  he proceeded to würzburg to further his medical studies and there he met physiologist and anatomist ignaz döllinger as a result of his interest in botany from – von baer studied comparative anatomy with döllinger who encouraged him to research the development of the chick however von baer was unwilling or unable to spend the time and money necessary to pursue this area of study and instead returned to berlin during the winter of – to train in practical anatomy in august  von baer became a prosector in anatomy in königsberg at the invitation of karl friedrich burdach in  he became extraordinary professor of anatomy and in  ordinary professor of zoology during his time in königsberg von baer taught zoology anatomy and anthropology founded a zoological museum acted as director of the botanical gardens and served as dean of the medical faculty and as rector of the university most of von baer’s contributions to embryology were from – while at königsberg during this time he returned to the study of embryology and made considerable advances in the understanding of extraembryonic membrane development and function in the chick and in mammals in this work he built on the results of research he had carried out collaboratively in würzburg with christian heinrich pander as well as on pander’s own work on chick embryology karl ernst von baer also introduced the term “spermatozoa” for what had previously been referred to as “animalcules” in the seminal fluid which he believed to be parasites in  von baer discovered mammalian eggs in the ovary of burdach’s dog completing a search that began centuries before drawing a number of conclusions from his work on developing embryos von baer emphasized that development is epigenetic proceeding from homogeneous to heterogeneous matter which he felt made preformationist ideas no longer plausible he encapsulated his thinking into four statements that are now known as “von baer’s laws” the first law says that the general features of a large group of animals appear earlier in the embryo than the special features the second law says that less general characters are developed from the most general and so forth until finally the most specialized appear the third law is that instead of passing through the stages of other animals each embryo of a given species departs more and more from them finally the fourth law concludes from the previous three that the embryo of a higher animal is never like the adult of a lower animal but only like its embryo after the death of his brother louis von baer returned with his family to st petersburg to retain the family estate he then entered the academy of sciences in st petersburg as a full member in zoology in december  after refusing previous offers while in königsberg after working at the academy as a librarian academician and professor of anatomy and physiology von baer retired from active membership in  but continued to work as an honorary member until  after returning to dorpat von baer died on  november  sources oppenheimer jane “von baer
