drivers strong collateral quality the b pool has a weightedaverage wa fico score of  the strongest to date for any mbalt pool strong wa seasoning of  months and increased vehicle model diversity in the pool in addition the pool has a smaller concentration of leases with terms greater than  months typically a higher driver of residual value rv losses adequate credit enhancement ce structure initial ce totals  consistent with a nr growing to a target of  then decreasing to  of the initial securitization value once the ab floating rate notes are paid in full initial excess spread is  decreased from the three most recent transactions due to higher pricing loss coverage is adequate to support fitchs aaasf stressed assumptions weakening rv losses despite continued low credit losses mbfs residual losses have trended higher recently particularly for the c and e classes mb vehicle values continue to be affected by the large amount of offlease vehicle supply and introduction of refreshed classes over the past year or so evolving wholesale vehicle market the us wholesale vehicle market wvm has been normalizing following strong performance in recent years fitch expects that pressure from increased offlease vehicle supply and high production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during the life of the transaction stable corporate health fitch rates daimler ag the parent of mbfs af with a stable rating outlook fitch believes mbfs to be an adequate originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical performance of its managed portfolio and prior securitizations legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of mbfs would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles andor increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of ce and loss coverage levels available to the notes under a moderate stress scenario of x the base case credit loss the targeted loss coverage would decrease enough to warrant a potential downgrade of possibly one notch to the class a notes the resilience is partially due to the strength of the nondeclining structure of the ce as well as the tradeoff that occurs when credit defaults are increased as credit defaults are increased less of the collateral is subject to residual stresses upon lease end under the more severe credit loss stress of x the base case credit loss changes in target coverage would likely result in a downgrade of one to two rating categories for the class a notes comparatively speaking the class a ratings are more sensitive to fluctuations in rv losses than credit losses as is the case for most auto lease abs transactions a moderate stress to the rv loss estimate an increase in the base case to  would likely result in a negative rating action of approximately three rating categories for the class a notes with notes retaining their investment grade value under the severe rv loss stress an increase in the base case to  the class a notes could be downgraded below investment grade to the bbsf range however fitch considers the severe rv loss scenario along with the other sensitivities described herein to be highly unlikely given the current state of the market and historical mbalt transaction performance due diligence usage fitch was provided with thirdparty due diligence information from kpmg llp the

me a mercedesbenz thats the opening line of mercedesbenz a song most famously recorded by singer janis joplin in the early s the tune gently poked fun at materialism and our desire for the finer things in life its fitting that the renowned german marque figures prominently in the lyric mercedesbenz has long been known for crafting vehicles that emphasize luxury and refinement for many its vehicles are sleek symbols of status success and good taste in january of  karl benz unveiled the worlds first automobile a threewheeled vehicle dubbed the benz patent motor car a few months later gottlieb daimler and his chief engineer wilhelm maybach rolled out a fourwheeled vehicle powered by his daimler engine the first mercedes was crafted in  shortly after daimlers death built by maybach the car was commissioned by emil jellinek one of daimlers primary distributors and was ultimately named after jellineks daughter mercedes in  the companies founded by daimler and benz merged to form daimlerbenz ag and the mercedesbenz brand was born the companys insignia was a threepointed star wreathed in a laurel the star was dreamed up by daimler years earlier and its three points signified the fact that his engines were used in vehicles that traveled land air and sea right from the start the mercedesbenz name was synonymous with automotive excellence one of the automakers earliest vehicles the  mercedesbenz  distinguished itself as the worlds first production car to offer a technology that was nothing short of extraordinary for the day fourwheel independent suspension the s and s saw mercedes establishing itself as the brand of choice for car buyers seeking the ultimate in luxury thanks to coveted cruisers like the  and k the s witnessed the introduction of the mercedesbenz  sl gullwing a sports car that has been described as being the worlds first supercar with its dramatic styling and racebred technology the  sl reigns today as a classic coveted by collectors worldwide the decade also saw daimlerbenz making strides in the area of safety technology the companys mercedesbenz  sedans were the first vehicles to incorporate its patented crumple zone body design created to absorb impact in the event of a crash in  the company cemented its reputation as the home of automotive luxury with the launch of the mercedesbenz  the elegant luxurious sedan was also available as a limousine and featured an aheadofitstime air suspension system and a v engine that boasted  horsepower the decade also saw the launch of the mercedesbenz  sel  this fullsize sedan went from zero to  in under seven seconds distinguishing itself as the quickest luxury car is its day the s saw the birth of the brands storied sclass line of vehicles opulent sedans and coupes that coddled passengers with powerful engines and a long list of luxury features the decade also saw mercedes continuing on the cutting edge of safety technology by being the first to offer antilock brakes in its vehicles daimlerbenzs safety advancements continued in the s its cars were the first to offer airbags and traction control the manufacturer also raised the bar in terms of ride comfort and handling when it introduced multilink rear suspension the technology debuted on the compact mercedesbenz  e and it remains a vital component of the companys chassis engineering to this day mercedesbenz vehicles got an extra dose of power and performance in the s thanks to the manufacturers partnership with amg a performance and tuning shop that was eventually purchased by the company to help produce ultrahighperformance versions of some of its vehicles the first amg model offered in the us was the sporty c amg in  since then mercedes has gone on to offer an amgtuned version of almost all of its vehicles the companys current lineup is the most comprehensive in its history with a variety of sedans coupes suvs and roadsters filling mercedes showrooms it seems like the only thing missing is a pickup truck surely the fact that janis joplins song holds as much relevance today as it did four decades ago is a strong indicator that the brands premier status is still very much intact hide
