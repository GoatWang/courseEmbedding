developing a specific fork for x it makes a huge difference being able to tune it in with fitzy and justin at the world cups what else is in your garage intense podium bmx golf clubs gym and trophies whats your training regimen about  hours a day loads of gym work at the moment also sprints on the bike xc riding dh riding but most of all riding the x bike at x tracks loads of gate starts any major injuries and how did you recover a few here and there but for the most part i have been lucky last year i tore all the ligaments in my left foot at the second world cup in maribor slovenia i tried to carry on racing in the weeks afterwards with a shoe two sizes bigger on my left foot but in the end i had to stop racing recover and come back at the end of the season the recovery was cool as i worked with a premiership football phisio learnt a few new things with him whats your typical preraceevent meal guilty pleasure prerace meal is pasta its pretty easy to eat and fuels me up guilty pleasure would be vanilla ice cream how do you determine which races or events to enter each year i always have a set program of x races   british x nationals  euro x rounds and  world cups plus the big one day events  national championships european championships and world championships then we add in other festival events if they work with the schedule what motivated you to get started professionally my dad was a professional motorcycle racer racing is really in my family so it was always going to happen my mom used to race motorcycles and my uncle still runs one of the biggest motorsport associations in the uk so i wanted to race something i started out in bmx and moved to mtb in  what separates you from other professional athletes not much separates any of us to be honest usually just  percent mentally on race day makes the difference what would you be doing if you werent a professional athlete jet pilot it was always my real job dream at school although i raced my first bmx european championship when i was just  years old so the pro athlete route was always inevitable whats the best thing about being a professional athlete travelling around the world and seeing so many sights that i may not have seen otherwise also pushing myself in my training and not being restricted with time in my training sessions being able to ride anytime is the biggest bonus what other sports are you interested in moto x i love supercross and moto x i also like moto gp formula  world rally speedway golf bmx if its a race then im interested any advice to the readers dreaming to turn pro if you are not training then someone else is to become a pro takes a lot of dedication and hard work it is worth it in so many ways but you might have to pass on a few of those nights out

qualifying session   usn racing diary – x protour fort william posted on july   by boomboom we have just finished editing the new diary from fort william x protour check our the video footage from the weekend and see what it is like fro the riders point of view at this huge event enjoy x protour  – round  fort william scotland posted on june   by boomboom last weekend scott had one of his most important races on the  calendar the x protour round in fort william scotland held as part of the fort william downhill world cup weekend this event attracts thousands of fans who flock to the scottish highlands to watch x protour downhill world cup and the impressive side events the race had a good entry so when practice started the track had a constant flow of riders as everyone got to grips with it the weather was wet but in many ways that helped the new track changes to bind together the new changes were good as they added  extra turns to the track which would really help passing opportunities come race time scott has had some great results here in the past and always rides his track well so we were confident heading into qualifying with all the top riders injury free this year’s x protour looked set to be one of the best ever with  of the elite men riders all more than capable of taking wins and the overall title the strength in depth of x protour is now better than ever scott knows that consistency will be the key and was looking for a decent qualifying to set up his race night qualifying in his qualifying run visually scott looked one of the quickest on course and as he crossed – until the last turn where scott ran off line and almost crashed having to roll through the final jump scott lost a lot of time but still managed to cross the finish in th clearly gutted scott knew he was on a flier and it was time to plan racing on saturday night after the run scott said “i made a great start and rode all the lines well i really messed up in the final turn and that cost me today but we will be back tomorrow”   race day race day rolled around and the weather took a turn before practice started a huge downpour made the track tricky initially but as racing rolled around the rain stopped and the track surprisingly was perfect with huge crowds scott was ready winning his first  rounds of racing scott was looking good in his quarter final scott made a great gate and led the race into turn  ahead of joost wichman scott looked comfortable as he booked his place in the semi final semi final in the semi final scott opted for the slightly smoother gate  this race was all time in the last  years of x racing these  guys had all been instrumental in the development of the sport and world wide promotion these guys are the jedi’s and the crowd knew it high fiving before the start scott lined up with tomas slavik quentin derbier and joost wichman the gate dropped and scott got squeezed having to settle into th position in the first turn scott used his head and railed the turn carrying loads of speed on the nd straight scott was on the move railing turn  he moved into rd and then in the blink of an eye he moved into nd the crowd were going crazy but on the exit of the turn scott then got overtook again and slipped back to rd staying in touch scott battled but across the finish he ended up rd and didn’t make the main final small final scott was absolutely gutted making the final is extremely important to scott at this race but after such an incredible semi final the only winner was the sport of x one of the hardest things in x is to get knocked out in the semi final and then pick yourself back up to race again for th to th places scott took gate  nailed a perfect gate and set off chasing the win and th overall for the evening scott had to hold the inside on turn  to protect against a pass but quentin derbier used the same move as scott made in the semi final and moved into the lead the race stayed close but scott crossed the line in nd giving him th for the evening it wasn’t scott’s best race in fort william but he was very happy with the way he raced on the night “i am pretty disappointed with th but at the same time happy with how i rode that was a race where anyone could have won but i gave it my all and th was the result we have a few weeks now to prepare for the next round in czech republic” usn racing – x

the weekend after a strong start to his  season scott beaumont was looking to cement himself in the running for the overall title in winterberg with a track that really played to his strengths held as part of the dirt masters festival this event attracts thousands of fans who flock to winterberg in germany to watch x protour ixs downhill cup and the impressive slopestyle event the race had nearly  riders entered so practice was busy and the track had a constant flow of riders as everyone got to grips with it the weather was dry for qualifying making the track superfast and dusty the sun was shining and the track was absolutely perfect scott has had some great results here in the past and always rides his track well so we were confident heading into qualifying with all the top riders injury free this year’s x protour looked set to be one of the best ever with  of the elite men riders all more than capable of taking wins and the overall title the strength in depth of x protour is now better than ever scott knows that consistency will be the key and was looking for a decent qualifying run to put himself in a good position for racing in his qualifying run visually scott looked one of the quickest on course and as he crossed the finish line the time agreed placing scott in th position disappointed with the run scott said “i made a great start and rode all the lines well i was a little conservative due to the cross wind on the table tops lower down on the track it was a good run but to be  seconds off and all the way down in th is disappointing” race day rolled around and scott was ready the yeti race bikes were prepped and scott rode a couple of practice laps to prepare for the racing winning his first round of racing scott was looking good in his second round scott made his best gate of the weekend and led the race into turn  but disaster struck losing his front wheel scott crashed out in a quick scramble for bikes scott remounted and was chasing the leading two riders the amount of ground that scott made up was incredible and if the track had been m longer he may well have been able to make the comeback of the season but he simply ran out of track absolutely gutted scott finished rd which placed him th for the day after the race scott said “well that was a tough day in the office the main thing is i have no broken bones or serious injuries hands up that was my mistake as i pushed hard into turn one and i just lost the front wheel mistakes are rare in our team but today is one of those days i have  days now to get ready for fort william and round three” as scott mentioned there the teams next event is x protour round  in fort william scotland this saturday in the meantime our team diary edit will be live from winterberg

winter months are finally over and the  season is here scott’s preparation has been perfect and we are now on route to round  of the x protour being held in roquebrune france coming into this season as uci world number  scott is looking for consistency to work towards the overall x protour title the track in france was a bitter sweet pill to swallow for scott last year as a mistake whilst leading cost him a shot at the race win he is looking for a solid start to his campaign this year with some fresh sponsors on board for the  campaign the team are motivated and ready to race arriving on wednesday afternoon we went to look at the track located at the heart of the new azur bike park what has been created is amazing built on the side of a mountain the track winds its way through huge berms multi lines and some of the biggest jumps in the x protour into the finish arena there were several changes to the track with more width on the first two straights fresh berms added and a new section into the tree line the track in roquebrune overlooks the french riviera coastal town of st maxime so as well as being an amazing track the views are incredible the longest track currently used on the x protour this year at around  seconds this was going to be a wild race on wednesday evening we headed over to st maxime bmx track for their club night after a full day of driving to the south of france a trip to one of scott’s favorite bmx tracks to unwind was perfect the track is amazing and together with team photographer charles robertson scott had a play on the track and we got some great shots thursday was the first official day of training at the x track after a track walk it was time to get started working on the top half of the track initially scott worked on set up and looked at home straight away the track was in immaculate condition and allowed the riders to really push hard the racing was certainly going to be quick come race time in the afternoon we were lucky enough to have a couple of hours where we were able to visit monaco to have a look round the formula  track was just being built with grandstands and the pit lane garages all under construction quite a sight on to friday training and scott focused on the bottom half of the track and his tyre choice for the weekend another  hours of track time and confidence was building nicely into the weekend in the afternoon we visited st tropez for a quick walk around some super yachts saturday morning and it was game time after a two hour practice session it was qualifying in the two hours scott simply did full runs to prepare for the one lap of qualifying using all the outside lines and carrying speed we were looking for a top  and the first points of the year with scott being the uci world number  x rider he went last with only one rider going below  seconds the job was simple get a  point something and he would be in the top two with a perfect qualifying lap that’s exactly what scott did stopping the clock at  it was good enough for second position on saturday night the organisers hosted a bbq for all the riders it was great to socialise with everyone and catch up on what everyone had been doing over winter an early night for the team to get ready for race day sunday morning and there was a two hour practice session with no track changes scott did a couple of practice starts then two full runs and with over an hour remaining he decided to save his energy for the racing at  the racing started scott took the win in his first two rounds and was looking fast backing up his qualifying ride in the quarter final he made a perfect start and again led the race from start to finish with no problems onto the semi final and this looked tougher scott again made a perfect start and battled bar to bar into turn one defending and holding his line to lead the race from here scott pulled away and took a convincing win final time scott was in gate two making a good gate scott again went bar to bar with both riders either side of him and unfortunately this time he got squeezed into turn  re grouping and starting the charge from fourth scott rode hard all the way down the track and dived inside on the final turn but unfortunately he could not get the bike turned enough to make the pass stick fourth position for scott and some good points to start his  x protour campaign scott really felt like this was the race that got away though and is now heading home to continue his preparation for the next round at winterberg germany on may th we want to thank all the team sponsors for helping us put together an amazing package that is allowing scott to ride at his absolute maximum   until next time       scott beaumont signs contract with fuchs silkolene posted on
