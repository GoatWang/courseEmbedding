the mvmds modular design achieves greater efficiencies in a smaller lighter package compatible with space and weight restrictions on surface combatant ships     static automatic bus transfer sabt switches  a  a voltage phase  vac or  vac the sabt automatically transfers critical loads from a normal power source to an alternate power source in less than ¼ cycle in the event of interruption or abnormal conditions l power paragons sabt has been developed to protect missioncritical power loads on naval ships submarines and other defense applications as such the sabt is compatible with milstd and stanag    multiclass sabt the mcsabt automatically transfers critical loads from a normal power source to an alternate power source in the event of interruption or abnormal conditions the mcsabt was developed to protect mission critical power loads on naval ships submarines and other defense applications as such the mcsabt is compatible with milstd and stanag  designed using siliconcontrolled rectifier scr powerswitching elements the mcsabt transfers the critical load between power sources in less than  cycle upon loss of sourceâ€”more than  times faster than traditional electromechanical switchesâ€”appearing seamless to even the most sophisticated loads transfer is programmable from  ms to  seconds advanced degaussing system ads l power paragons ads provides controlled current to independent degaussing coils installed in the hull of a ship the ads provides the precise current required to generate a composite magnetic field that counteracts the effects of the ship on the earth’s magnetic field       aircooled frequency converters acfc  hz  hz l power paragons acfc represents the next leap forward in refined stable and reliable power delivery to central and distributed

systems the need to protect power distribution networks against highcurrent overloads and fault loads is critical for mission success l power paragons fiu is a unique and innovative device designed to limit the negative effects of fault loads thereby increasing the flexibility and survivability of any power delivery system   static transfer switch sts the l power paragon static transfer switch is a worldrecognized faulttolerant switch that is engineered to meet the online reliability requirements of highspeed highvolume switches throughout the industry transfers the critical load between power sources in less than ¼ cycle upon loss of primary power accomplishes rapid transfer without crossconnecting power sources allows for transfer between dissimilar sources precision digital sense and control circuits that do not require calibration adjustments dedicated logic ensures fast and predictable operation at all times modular construction maximizes reliability and maintainability separating power electronics from bypass system front panel access allows safe load testing   series sts – highspeed digital static transfer switch stsspy wall mount this amp sts automatically transfers critical loads from a primary power source to an alternate power source in the event of interruption or abnormal conditions     static transfer switch – static neutral switching now
