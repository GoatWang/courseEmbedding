video traffic cloud computing and online social networking to address this increased bandwidth demand catv and telecommunications service providers are competing directly against each other by providing bundles of voice video and data services to their subscribers and investing to enhance the capacity reliability and capability of their networks the trend of rising bandwidth consumption

equipment vendors who have begun to outsource both the design and manufacture of this equipment while equipment vendors have relied upon third parties to assemble portions of their products within the past four years certain of our customers have accelerated the outsourcing of both the design and manufacturing of both headend equipment and node equipment to third parties the shift is due in part to

 gbps  •  wide operating temperature range rohs compliant package  •  fully gr telcordia compliant the ftth market generally refers to the passive optical networks or pons that telecommunications service providers are deploying pons take their name from the use of passive splitters to divide the optical signal provided to each residential user over a shared fiberoptic cable from a service provider’s central office the equipment in the service provider’s central office is called an optical line terminal or olt and the equipment at the end user is an optical network unit or onu a pon supports significantly greater bandwidth than does the legacy copper wire network although the connection speed to a user the “downstream” speed is higher than the connection speed from the user the “upstream” speed in the us verizon’s fios service and att’s uverse offering are examples of pon deployments and pons have been widely deployed in japan korea and selected cities in europe as well according to a  infonetics report worldwide ftth subscribers are expected to grow from  million in  to  million in  representing a cagr of  with the growth of higher speed ftth connections among those subscribers being greater than the overall growth of ftth connectivity over time the technology used in pons has evolved to meet the increased bandwidth demand from users at present the most commonly deployed pon technology is gpon or gigabit pon which delivers up to  gigabits per second of data downstream split among subscribers and  gigabits per second upstream due to the splitting of the bandwidth among multiple users—often as many as —the actual bandwidth delivered to an individual subscriber is far less than the  gigabits per second supported by the gpon equipment to deliver more bandwidth to a subscriber a service provider can reduce the split ratio or change the pon technology reducing the number of subscribers supported by a single olt may be less expensive for modest incremental upgrades but may not be the most economical solution to deliver the significant increases in bandwidth needed to support  gigabit per second service to the home as encouraged by the fcc’s gigabit challenge one approach that does support  gigabit per second service to the home connection is wdmpon or wavelength division multiplexing pon wellproven in other areas of the network for decades wdm technology enables the transmission of multiple wavelengths of data over a single fiberoptic strand thus significantly increasing the bandwidth of the physical fiber connection due to this significant increase in bandwidth supported with wdmpon the cost per bit delivered to a subscriber is lower than that for gpon—at faster connection speeds in addition to providing more bandwidth wdmpon offers a subscriber superior privacy and the service provider better scalability because each subscriber has a dedicated wavelength rather than a shared one view all telecom sfp and sfp msa

excellent linearity  •  designed for rf modulation to  mhz rohs compliant package  •  fully gr telcordia compliant the catv market is our largest and most established market for which we supply a broad array of products including lasers transmitters and turnkey equipment in  we were the leading provider of optical components and the second largest provider of subsystems to the catv industry according to research firm ovum limited or ovum sales of headend node and distribution equipment have contributed significantly to our growth in recent years as a result of our ability to meet the needs of catv equipment vendors who have begun to outsource both the design and manufacture of this equipment while equipment vendors have relied upon third parties to assemble portions of their products within the past four years certain of our customers have accelerated the outsourcing of both the design and manufacturing of both headend equipment and node equipment to third parties the shift is due in part to the sophisticated engineering expertise needed to perform this work we believe that our extensive highspeed optical mixed‑signal semiconductor and mechanical engineering capabilities position us well to benefit from these industry dynamics view all data center tranceivers  •  transmitter optical subassembly sub assemblies an internet data center is structured in a layered format with rows of servers within multiple racks and each server and rack connecting through a switch these rack switches then connect to each other and ultimately to the service provider’s network the connections between these topofrack switches and to the service provider’s network are increasingly done with higher‑capacity optical networking technology legacy copper cables can carry signals at distances adequate to meet most needs within an enterprise or internet data center at speeds up to about  gigabit per second however at speeds of  gigabits per second and above the signals sent over copper cables experience increasing attenuation and dispersion over distances common in large internet data center environments making copper much less effective as a transmission medium according to a  infonetics report  gigabit ethernet enterprise port shipments in  were  million and are projected to grow to  million in  representing a  cagr in recent years a number of leading internet companies such as amazoncom inc facebook inc google inc and microsoft corporation have begun to adopt more open internet data center architectures using a mix of systems and components from a variety of vendors and in some cases designing their own equipment for these companies compatibility of new networking equipment with legacy infrastructure is not as important and as a consequence these companies are more willing to work with non‑traditional equipment vendors non‑traditional equipment vendors generally permit companies to source optical modules from any vendor thus creating an open and growing opportunity for optical device vendors view all ftth downstreamupstream rates up to  gbps  •  wide operating temperature range rohs compliant package  •  fully gr telcordia compliant the ftth market generally refers to the passive optical networks or pons that telecommunications service providers are deploying pons take their name from the use of passive splitters to divide the optical signal provided to each residential user over a shared fiberoptic cable from a service provider’s central office the equipment in the service provider’s central office is called an optical line terminal or olt and the equipment at the end user is an optical network unit or onu a pon supports significantly greater bandwidth than does the legacy copper wire network although the connection speed to a user the “downstream” speed is higher than the connection speed from the user the “upstream” speed in the us verizon’s fios service and att’s uverse offering are examples of pon deployments and pons have been widely deployed in japan korea and selected cities in europe as well according to a  infonetics report worldwide ftth subscribers are expected to grow from  million in  to  million in  representing a cagr of  with the growth of higher speed ftth connections among those subscribers being greater than the overall growth of ftth connectivity over time the technology used in pons has evolved to meet the increased bandwidth demand from users at present the most commonly deployed pon technology is gpon or gigabit pon which delivers up to  gigabits per second of data downstream split among subscribers and  gigabits per second upstream due to the splitting of the bandwidth among multiple users—often as many as —the actual bandwidth delivered to an individual subscriber is far less than the  gigabits per second supported by the gpon equipment to deliver more bandwidth to a subscriber a service provider can reduce the split ratio or change the pon technology reducing the number of subscribers supported by a single olt may be less expensive for modest incremental upgrades but may not be the most economical solution to deliver the significant increases in bandwidth needed to support  gigabit per second service to the home as encouraged by the fcc’s gigabit challenge one approach that does support  gigabit per second service to the home connection is wdmpon or wavelength division multiplexing pon wellproven in other areas of the network for decades wdm technology enables the transmission of multiple wavelengths of data over a single fiberoptic strand thus significantly increasing the bandwidth of the physical fiber connection due to this significant increase in bandwidth supported with wdmpon the cost per bit delivered to a subscriber is lower than that for gpon—at faster connection speeds in addition to providing more bandwidth wdmpon offers a subscriber superior privacy and the service provider better scalability because each subscriber has a dedicated wavelength rather than a shared one view all telecom sfp and sfp msa compliant  •  rohs compliant in contrast with transceivers used in data centers and datacom which are typically designed

networking products we serve three growing endmarkets cable television broadband catv fibertothehome ftth and internet data centers data center we design and manufacture a range of optical communications products employing our vertical integration strategy from laser chips components subassemblies and modules to complete turnkey equipment we design manufacture and integrate our own analog and digital lasers using a proprietary molecular beam epitaxy mbe fabrication process which we believe is unique in our industry the lasers we manufacture are proven to be reliable over time and highly tolerant of changes in temperature and humidity delivering millions of hours service making them wellsuited to the catv and ftth markets where networking equipment is often installed outdoors all three of our end markets are driven by bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network‑connected devices that included video traffic cloud computing and online social networking to address this increased bandwidth demand catv and telecommunications service providers are competing directly against each other by providing bundles of voice video and data services to their subscribers and investing to enhance the capacity reliability and capability of their networks the trend of rising bandwidth consumption also impacts the internet data center market as reflected in the shift to higher speed server connections as a result of these trends fiber‑optic networking technology is becoming essential in all three of our target markets as it is often the only economic way to deliver the desired bandwidth « select an application or product type from the left for more information catv  broadband excellent linearity  •  designed for rf modulation to  mhz rohs compliant package  •  fully gr telcordia compliant the catv market is our largest and most established market for which we supply a broad array of products including lasers transmitters and turnkey equipment in  we were the leading provider of optical components and the second largest provider of subsystems to the catv industry according to research firm ovum limited or ovum sales of headend node and distribution equipment have contributed significantly to our growth in recent years as a result of our ability to meet the needs of catv equipment vendors who have begun to outsource both the design and manufacture of this equipment while equipment vendors have relied upon third parties to assemble portions of their products within the past four years certain of our customers have accelerated the outsourcing of both the design and manufacturing of both headend equipment and node equipment to third parties the shift is due in part to the sophisticated engineering expertise needed to perform this work we believe that our extensive highspeed optical mixed‑signal semiconductor and mechanical engineering capabilities position us well to benefit from these industry dynamics view all data

compliant package  •  fully gr telcordia compliant the ftth market generally refers to the passive optical networks or pons that telecommunications service providers are deploying pons take their name from the use of passive splitters to divide the optical signal provided to each residential user over a shared fiberoptic cable from a service provider’s central office the equipment in the service provider’s central office is called an optical line terminal or olt and the equipment at the end user is an optical network unit or onu a pon supports significantly greater bandwidth than does the legacy copper wire network although the connection speed to a user the “downstream” speed is higher than the connection speed from the user the “upstream” speed in the us verizon’s fios service and att’s uverse offering are examples of pon deployments and pons have been widely deployed in japan korea and selected cities in europe as well according to a  infonetics report worldwide ftth subscribers are expected to grow from  million in  to  million in  representing a cagr of  with the growth of higher speed ftth connections among those subscribers being greater than the overall growth of ftth connectivity over time the technology used in pons has evolved to meet the increased bandwidth demand from users at present the most commonly deployed pon technology is gpon or gigabit pon which delivers up to  gigabits per second of data downstream split among subscribers and  gigabits per second upstream due to the splitting of the bandwidth among multiple users—often as many as —the actual bandwidth delivered to an individual subscriber is far less than the  gigabits per second supported by the gpon equipment to deliver more bandwidth to a subscriber a service provider can reduce the split ratio or change the pon technology reducing the number of subscribers supported by a single olt may be less expensive for modest incremental upgrades but may not be the most economical solution to deliver the significant increases in bandwidth needed to support  gigabit per second service to the home as encouraged by the fcc’s gigabit challenge one approach that does support  gigabit per second service to the home connection is wdmpon or wavelength division multiplexing pon wellproven in other areas of the network for decades wdm technology enables the transmission of multiple wavelengths of data over a single fiberoptic strand thus significantly increasing the bandwidth of the physical fiber connection due to this significant increase in bandwidth supported with wdmpon the cost per bit delivered to a subscriber is lower than that for gpon—at faster connection speeds in addition to providing more bandwidth wdmpon offers a subscriber superior privacy and the service provider better scalability because each subscriber has a dedicated wavelength rather than a shared one view all telecom sfp and sfp msa compliant  •  rohs compliant in
