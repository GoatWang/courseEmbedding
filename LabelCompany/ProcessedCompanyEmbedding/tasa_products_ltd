creditor of esc murphy elgot  moore represented by mr thomas murphy these assets are primarily amounts owed to esc by the partnerships and the rights to produce electronics products at crc the general partners began discussions with mr murphy who was also counsel for esc and the partnerships on plans to recommercialize the electronic products they were joined by mr keith nichols who had purchased a portion of the electronics inventory from crc when esc was still in chapter  after conducting preliminary market research and reaching a basic understanding with mr murphy a new company was formed in september  called linc technology corporation the company was owned by messrs maes steffey and nichols in the amount of  each mr murphy owned  and the balance of  was owned by outside investors in  a ownership restructuring took place with the unanimous approval of all stockholders mr maes and mr steffey now own a higher percentage of linc technology corporation linc was formed and was initially privately financed with  of cash plus donated time to pursue a variety of opportunities in electronics and data communications linc believes that a market remains for the partnerships products continued emphasis is on the lcm and the dove now called the mdl    the partnership made only one attempt to negotiate a license for its products following the dissolution of energy sciences corporation and its subsidiary communications research corporation the initial licensee in  a nonaffiliated company had been formed in  called crc inc of which mr keith nichols was a cofounder and partner as described above mr nichols was subsequently a cofounder of linc technology corporation in  along with mr steffey and mr maes general partners of the partnership crc inc purchased inventory of the partnerships products in  from the energy sciences corporation trustee because there are no patents or trade secrets covering any of the partnerships products the owners of crc inc felt no responsibility to pay royalties to the partnership and had no legal obligation to do so when the issue was discussed with them it was felt that this would be the case with any outside third party the general partners might approach when mr nichols expressed a desire to pursue the market more aggressively than crc inc was doing mr steffey and mr maes proposed the formation of linc technology corporation with the understanding that linc would pay royalties on partnership products in the future linc was formed and mr nichols subsequently sold the inventory of partnership products he owned personally to linc for ultimate resale to outside customers the royalty arrangement arrived at between the partnership and linc was modeled after one negotiated with new detonics manufacturing corporation ndmc for a group of affiliated partnerships as part of the sale of assets of another energy sciences corporation subsidiary detonics manufacturing corporation to ndmc that royalty arrangement called for  royalties and a four year deferment the license entered into between the partnerships and linc calls for a royalty building to  of gross sales to be paid to each partnership on sales if any of its own products compared to the prior formula with crc which ranged from  down to  royalties are paid on amounts actually collected by linc from sales of partnership products and calculated and accrued in the following quarterly accounting period    the details of the royalty arrangement are as follows initial royalties of  are payable on collected invoices for sales starting in september  followed by  in september  and  per year starting in september  and thereafter the royalty is divided between partnerships in the case of joint ownership of product rights tasa receives  of the  royalty from sales of dove mdl and  of the  from sales of lcm in  a new royalty agreement was put into effect in order to reduce administrative expenses under the new plan no royalties will accrue to the partnership until a total of  of sales on products licensed to linc technology corporation have been generated and collected at that point a lump sum royalty payment of  will be paid to the partnership group of tasa products limited the partnership energy sciences limited partnership telemetric controls limited partnership and communications link limited partnership after such payment again no royalty will accrue or be owed until another  in sales has occurred after which a second lump sum of  is due and so forth linc technology corporation will be responsible for periodic mailings to the partnership at its expense based on irs regulations no partnership  tax returns and ks have to be filed or issued until the royalty is paid filings of  and k forms were done in march  for year  filings of  and k forms were done again in march  for year  for information purposes to show the changes in capital accounts no  and k filings were required or done in  as described above in  the general partners put in place an arrangement under which royalties would not be payable to the partnerships and profit would not accrue until a total of  in sales had occurred in  as the amount of sales was approaching  again the general partners reviewed the costs associated with preparing the partnership tax returns form  and the preparation and mailing of both the ks and distribution checks based on the experience in  the general partners estimated the cost to be approximately  in addition the general partners heard from many limited partners that the trouble involved in providing the tax information to their accountants was not worth the money that they received    the general partners therefore increased the level of sales required before a royalty payment is due from  to  which would result in a royalty payment totaling  instead of  to be divided among all individual limited partners as a result a smaller percentage of the royalty would go to tax form and check preparation costs accounting information in early  indicated that the  point had been reached so linc technology would pay out the appropriate amount near the end of  and send checks and irs k forms in early  however the worldwide recession had a severe impact on linc technology starting in mid  and has involved layoffs and salary cuts that remained the case through  as a result in the decline of business linc technology was not able to make the royalty payment so no distribution was made to the limited partners and no irs ks were issued it is now hoped that the royalty payment can be made in late  but there can be no assurance of that linc technology corporations new address is in issaquah wa   their telephone number remains  linc technology corporation uses the dba of datalinc group as previously reported one remaining item from the dismissal of energy sciences corporations bankruptcy is the residual amount initially owed to esc by the partnership and then to the law firm of murphy  elgot mr murphy has passed away and the debt is now owed to his former partner mr elgot no specific payment schedule or percentage of the partnerships overall royalty cash flow has been established to settle the debt mr elgot has occasionally done legal work for linc technology corporation the partnerships ultimate success is dependant on lincs ability to generate sales and to obtain capital which can not be continually assured sales on products licensed from the partnership were  in   in   in   in  and  in  this resulted in the royalty distribution early  in  a total of  of the partnerships’ products were sold by linc technology corporation this compares with  in   in   in   in   in   in   in   in   in   in   for   for  and  for  the cumulative total is now     such sales represent only a small portion of the sales for linc technology corporation which now manufactures and sells a broad range of industrial modems with emphasis on wireless modems since  new product development work was been undertaken at linc and other affiliates including independent rd efforts by the general partners personally which created some products that interface with and complement the products owned by the partnership and could enhance sales of the partnerships products in the future  sales of partnership products for calendar  can not be predicted but are expected to remain modest  linc has experienced some reduction in business from  through  due to increased competition but expects some improvement in   linc  has modest working capital and does not do significant advertising  linc

a conventional ripening process to produce one of the worlds best tasting fruit     tour our combined production capacity is  metric tons per hour home a brief understanding of the process of ‘purees’ and ‘concentrates’ fruit puree and concentrates are the versatile products of availability in the market the adequate processing and packing enables the manufacture along the whole year regardless of the seasons when the fruits are picked from the fields it is washed separating out stems and leaves and then graded machines extract seeds and pulp then strain and puree the fruit the puree then receives a quick heat treatment or pasteurization to deactivate organic enzymes preserving flavor color and texture offering a  month shelf life the puree is then cooled  packed thus puree is made from fruit that has been pulped and mashed   the concentrate process starts with the washing of fruits leaf cleaning boning enzyme deactivation and aseptic processing from this first processing phase the result is a paste that passes on to the evaporation process where water is reduced from the paste a pasteurization process normally follows and then aseptic packaging fruit concentrates come from fruit juice that has had the water removed during processing concentrates are thicker in consistency than purees also typically higher in sugars depending on the flavor a concentrate can be  –  stronger in flavor than its puree equivalency   news and events comming soon homeabout usnews  eventstourscontact us              tasa foods powered by  propellogic it solutions pvtltd tasa
