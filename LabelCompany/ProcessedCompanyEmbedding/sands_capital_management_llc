clients with prudence over time for over two decades our growthoriented philosophy and proprietary criteriadriven fundamental research has been at the heart of executing our mission frank m sands cfa chief investment officer chief executive officer we apply a single growthoriented investment philosophy rooted in the belief that over time stock prices reflect the earnings growth of the underlying business as growth investors we believe the earnings power of an asset drives value to create wealth for our clients we must concentrate investments in a select number of what we think are high quality businesses that possess the ability to sustainably grow earnings over time in our view there are relatively few truly outstanding businesses that can sustain earnings growth while maintaining a leadership position over the long term to identify these businesses we use a fundamental bottomup businessfocused research process that relies heavily on our six investment criteria as our compass we think our odds of identifying and owning valueadded investments are greatly enhanced when we have a high degree of conviction about how well a business meets these criteria our businessowner mindset and longterm perspective allow us to think differently we focus on finding key insights to identify layers of growth that may be underappreciated by the market in addition we fundamentally believe that providing clients with a concentrated and convictionweighted portfolio is a powerful way of adding value with prudence over full market cycles this has been our approach for more than
