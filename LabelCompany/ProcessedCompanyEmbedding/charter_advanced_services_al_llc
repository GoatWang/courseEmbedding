charter advanced services mn llc and charter advanced services viii mn llc collectively “charter advanced” are subsidiaries of charter communications inc “charter” a national communications company that provides services to residential and business customers—such as cable video broadband internet access and voice communications—through its affiliates see compl doc no  ¶¶   pls’ statement of undisputed material facts doc no  “suf” ¶¶   defendant nancy lange  is the chair of the minnesota public utilities commission “mpuc” and is sued in her official capacity defendants dan lipschultz john tuma matthew schuerger and katie sieben are commissioners of the mpuc and are also sued in their official capacities  see compl ¶¶  one of the features charter advanced offers its customers is realtime twoway  beverly jones heydinger the original lead defendant in this case retired from her position on january   and has been replaced as chair of the minnesota public utilities commission by nancy lange see mar   notice of substitution of party doc no  pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure d heydinger’s replacement as a commissioner—katie sieben—automatically substitutes as a defendant in this matter  throughout this order defendants will be referred to interchangeably as either “defendants” or “mpuc”  voice calling which it currently markets as “spectrum voice”  see suf ¶  charter advanced provides this feature using voice over internet protocol “voip” technology which transmits voice signals via a broadband internet connection as internet protocol “ip” data packets see id ¶¶  in contrast traditional telephone networks commonly known as the “public switched telephone network” or “pstn” provide voice telephony services using “circuit switching” technology in which a dedicated pathway is established over the line for the duration of a call id ¶  to route multiple calls over the same pstn traditional telephone providers use a technique known as time division multiplexing “tdm” id ¶  to effect transmission of voice signals as ip data packets charter advanced provides its spectrum voice subscribers with a device known as an embedded multimedia terminal adapter “emta” id ¶  the emta is housed in the same device as the cable modem that provides access generally to charter’s broadband internet service id ¶  the emta alters the format of voice calls between an analog electrical signal—as transmitted by the customer’s handset—and the ip data packets transmitted over charter advanced’s cable network id ¶  when a charter advanced customer calls or receives a call from a subscriber of a traditional telecommunications carrier the call must be converted between ip and tdm—a process commonly referred to as “protocol conversion” see id ¶  compl ¶  because it offers this capability to interact seamlessly with pstn networks spectrum voice is an  previous orders of this court have variously referred to what is now known as spectrum voice as “charter phone” or “voip service”  “interconnected” voip service although not all spectrum voice calls involve protocol conversion the majority of charter advanced’s voice traffic in minnesota currently does so suf ¶  in addition to providing voice transmission spectrum voice has the capability to provide customers with several additional communications features these include an online web portal “voice online manager” that allows customers to access voicemails as digital audio files convert voicemails to text and forward them via email id ¶  voice online manager also offers the ability to review and export call logs maintain lists of contacts associated with call logs and voicemails and direct numerous calling features such as specifying a “backup phone” that will ring in the event of an outage “simultaneous ring” that will cause incoming calls to ring numerous phone numbers at once call forwarding selective call blocking etc id spectrum voice can also send caller id information to cable settop boxes allowing subscribers with charter cable video services to display call information on their televisions id ¶  beyond these and other current features charter advanced’s ip infrastructure makes it possible to add new features to spectrum voice through software and network equipment changes id ¶  anticipated new features include a “softphone” feature—allowing spectrum voice subscribers to access calling features through a tablet or smartphone app—and a feature designed to identify and block unwanted “robo” calls by simultaneously routing incoming calls to a system that queries dynamic internetconnected databases of known robocalling numbers terminating calls if it finds a match id ¶  charter advanced provides every spectrum voice subscriber with access to all  current additional communication features id ¶  although subscribers can opt not to activate or utilized certain features and may obtain the voice calling aspect of spectrum voice without its other features charter advanced would need to have its personnel deactivate those features manually id ¶¶   very few customers request that charter advanced do so id ¶  further because charter advanced must activate a broadband connection to a residence or business in order to implement spectrum voice it is not marketed as a standalone offering but as a service option for customers who subscribe to charter’s broadband internet and cable television services although a customer could request spectrum voice without internet or cable and charter advanced would supply it such requests are “exceedingly rare” id ¶¶  b procedural history prior to march  charter offered voip services in minnesota through two affiliates—charter fiberlink cco llc and charter fiberlink cc viii llc collectively “charter fiberlink” comp ¶  in march  charter fiberlink assigned its retail voice customers to the newlyestablished charter advanced id ¶  the frank purpose behind the assignment was to limit the reach of state regulation thereby enhancing charter’s market competitiveness see tweeten aff doc no  ex  “moore dep” at   charter fiberlink notified its subscribers in writing of the change a month ahead of time and advised them that they could accept the revised terms by continuing their service compl ¶  the minnesota department of commerce “mdoc” responded to charter’s realignment on september   by filing a complaint with the mpuc id ¶   the complaint raised fifteen separate allegations including that charter advanced was in violation of several minnesota statutes see tweeten aff ex  “mdoc compl” at  charter advanced responded in part by arguing that state regulation of spectrum voice is preempted by federal law see tweeten aff ex  “mpuc order” at  the mpuc issued an order on july   finding that state regulation is not preempted see generally id it ordered charter advanced to submit within thirty days a proposed plan for compliance with applicable minnesota rules and regulations see idat  a final order to that effect was issued on september   compl ¶  charter advanced responded to the mpuc’s decision by instituting the present action its complaint seeks declaratory relief that state regulation of spectrum voice is preempted by federal law and injunctive relief prohibiting defendants from seeking to enforce that regulation of its service see compl ¶¶  defendants moved to dismiss arguing that charter advanced’s voip service is a “telecommunications service” for purposes of the telecommunications act of  and therefore subject to dual state and federal regulation see charter advanced servs mn llc v heydinger cv srnkmm  wl  at  d minn july   on referral from this court united states magistrate judge hildy bowbeer issued a report and recommendation “rr” recommending that defendants’ motion be denied see generally rr doc no  the rr concluded that defendants had not established as a matter of law that spectrum voice was not an “information service” for which state regulation is preempted see id at  the mpuc timely objected and on independent reconsideration this court overruled those objections and adopted the  rr see generally charter advanced  wl  in addition to ruling on the legal relevance of several orders of the federal communications commission “fcc” and federal courts the importance of which will become relevant as defendants’ current arguments are considered the court narrowly framed the issue for summary judgment whether spectrum voice is a telecommunications service or an information service for purposes of the telecommunications act of  see id at  if the former regulation by the mpuc is permissible if the latter it is preempted and impermissible the parties having completed discovery and

citing us const art vi cl  while the supreme court has delineated several instances in which preemption may arise of particular relevance here is its conclusion that federal agencies acting pursuant to their congressionally delegated authority may preempt state regulation louisiana pub serv comm’n v fcc  us    as this court recognized in its motion to dismiss order there “is simply no doubt” that the fcc has this general authority see charter advanced  wl  at  citing  usc § b the fount of regulatory authority in this matter is the telecommunications act of  by its enactment congress “unquestionably” took “the regulation of local telecommunications competition away from the states” with respect to matters covered by the act at  t corp v iowa util bd  us   n  of particular importance here the act broadly divides communication services into two main categories “telecommunications services” and “information services” see  usc §   see also nat’l cable  telecomms ass’n v brand x internet servs  us    under the statutory structure a telecommunications service is “the offering of telecommunications  for a fee directly to the public or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public regardless of the facilities used” id §  an information service by contrast is “the offering of a capability for generating acquiring storing transforming processing retrieving utilizing or making available information via telecommunications    but does not include any use of any such capability for the management control or operation of a telecommunications system or the management of a telecommunications service” id §  as this court has previously recognized telecommunications services are subject to state regulation while information services are not see charter advanced  wl  at  vonage holdings corp v minn pub utils comm’n  f supp d   d minn  “vonage i” see also minn pub utils comm’n v fcc  fd   th cir  “vonage iii” observing that “any regulation of an information service conflicts with the federal policy of nonregulation” b classifying spectrum voice the court now turns to address the central question of both parties’ summary judgment motions is spectrum voice properly considered a telecommunications service or an information service in support of the latter option charter advanced advances two primary arguments first it argues that—in keeping with this court’s holding in  the term “telecommunications” is defined as “the transmission between or among points specified by the user of information of the user’s choosing without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received”  usc §   vonage i—because spectrum voice provides subscribers with the capability to convert calls between ip and tdm it accomplishes a “net protocol conversion” that is independently sufficient to render spectrum voice an information service see pls’ mem in supp of mot for summ j doc no  “pls’ mem in supp” at  second charter advanced contends that because spectrum voice’s advanced communications features such as voice online manager are closely integrated with its telecommunications aspect it is an “offering” of an information service with a telecommunications component rather than an offering of telecommunications alone id for the reasons that follow the court agrees with charter advanced that spectrum voice engages in net protocol conversion and that this feature renders it an “information service” under applicable legal and administrative precedent accordingly the court need not reach charter advanced’s second “inextricably intertwined” argument  net protocol conversion as noted above spectrum voice is able to interface with pstn networks because it provides protocol conversion functionality—that is charter advanced has the capability to convert voice transmission data between ip and tdm as needed to hand a call off to a pstn network at a technical level charter advanced does so by routing calls that must be converted between protocols through a “media gateway” which sits on charter advanced’s side of the interconnection point with a tdmbased network see suf ¶  according to charter advanced because information enters its network in one format either ip or tdm depending on who originated the call and leaves in  another its system offers “net” protocol conversion which the fcc has defined as occurring when “an enduser can send information into a network in one protocol and have it exit the network in a different protocol” see implementation of the non accounting safeguards of sections  and  of the communications act of  as amended  fcc rcd   ¶   “nonaccounting safeguards order” in support of its argument charter advanced directs the court’s attention to several district court opinions—including one from this district—which have concluded that voip services engaged in net protocol conversion are information services for purposes of telecommunications regulation the seminal opinion in this regard is the vonage i decision see  f supp d at  in that case vonage sought to enjoin the enforcement of an order of the mpuc requiring it to comply with minnesota telephone regulations id at  vonage argued that its voip service which permitted customers to make computertocomputer and computertophone although not phonetophone calls from any location where broadband internet was available was an information service because among other things it required net protocol conversion in order to interface with pstn networks id at   this court agreed with vonage finding that the need to “act on” the format and protocol of the transferred information inherent in the iptdm interface rendered the vonage system an information service for purposes of the telecommunications act as judge davis observed examining the statutory language of the communications act the court  concludes that the voip service provided by vonage constitutes an information service because it offers the ‘capability for generating acquiring storing transforming processing retrieving utilizing or making available information via telecommunications’  usc §   the process of transmitting customer calls over the internet requires vonage to ‘act on’ the format and protocol of the information  cfr § a for calls originating with one of vonage’s customers calls in the voip format must be transformed into the format of the pstn before a pots plain old telephone service user can receive the call for calls originating from a pots user the process of acting on the format and protocol is reversed the court concludes that vonage’s activities fit within the definition of information services vonage’s services are closely tied to the provision of telecommunications services as defined by congress the courts and the fcc but this court finds that vonage uses telecommunications services rather than provides them id at  emphasis original the vonage i decision has since formed the basis of several other district court opinions which having considered facts broadly similar to those presented here have found that the provision of iptdm net protocol conversion is sufficient to render an interconnected voip service an information service see eg sw bell tel lp v mo pub serv comm’n  f supp d   ed mo  aff’d  fd  th cir  “ippstn traffic is an information service    because it involves a net protocol conversion from the digitized packets of the ip protocol to the tdm technology used on the pstn” paetec commc’ns inc v commpartners llc no cv jr  wl  at  ddc feb   adopting the reasoning of vonage i and southwestern bell in concluding that “transmissions which include net format conversion from voip to tdm are information services    ” charter advanced further notes that these district court opinions are consistent with the fcc’s nonaccounting  now  usc §   safeguards order which determined that “protocol processing services constitute information services under the  act”  fcc rcd at  ¶  having reviewed the decisions cited by charter advanced and the relevant orders of the fcc the court agrees that the logic espoused in vonage i applies equally to the facts of this case  in this specific factual context the touchstone of the information services inquiry is whether spectrum voice acts on the customer’s information—here a phone call—in such a way as to “transform” that information see  usc §  by altering the protocol in which that information is transmitted charter advanced’s service clearly does so this conclusion is in line with the fcc’s determination in the nonaccounting safeguards order which reasoned that “an endtoend protocol conversion service that enables an enduser to send information into a network in one protocol and have it exit the network in a different protocol clearly ‘transforms’ user information”  fcc rcd at  ¶  moreover the mere fact that spectrum voice calls do not always involve protocol transformation does not render the service any  although the voip service in vonage i offered only computertocomputer and computertophone calling—not phonetophone—this distinction does not materially affect the court’s analysis here as judge davis observed while the fcc has tentatively concluded that phonetophone ip telephony “bears the characteristics of ‘telecommunication services’” it defined “phonetophone’ ip telephony as a service meeting four conditions including  “it does not require the customer to use cpe different from that cpe necessary to place an ordinary touchtone call or facsimile transmission over the public switched telephone network” and  “it transmits customer information without net change in form or content” see vonage i  f supp d at  quoting in re federalstate joint board on universal service  fcc rcd   ¶   for reasons discussed infra in part iiib of this opinion spectrum voice meets neither condition cf vonage i  f supp d at  finding that vonage’s voip service met neither condition  nor condition  of the fcc’s test  less of an “offering” of information services at no point does the telecommunications act suggest or require that a customer use an information service’s transformative features all the time indeed the very language of the definition of an “information service”—which merely mandates that there be an “offering of a capability” to inter alia transform information—belies such a conclusion  see eg merriamwebster’s collegiate dictionary  th ed  defining “capability” in relevant part as “the facility or potential for an indicated use or deployment” emphasis added  the telecommunications exception the mpuc raises several arguments for why charter advanced’s reasoning—as it applies to the net protocol conversion issue—is flawed two of these arguments have already been addressed by the court and may be briefly disposed of here the first is that this court’s decision in vonage i has in some sense been repudiated—either by the eighth circuit or by the fcc defs’ mem in opp’n to mot for summ j doc no  “defs’ mem in opp’n” at  this court previously rejected this argument at the motion to dismiss stage see charter advanced  wl  at  n while it is true that subsequent decisions in the vonage line of cases chose to classify vonage as an information service based on reasons different from those deployed by the court in vonage i they did not in any sense overrule that decision see generally in the matter of vonage holdings corp  fcc rcd   “vonage ii” vonage iii  fd at  thus while vonage i does not control the outcome of this case its vitality  furthermore the undisputed record indicates that the majority of minnesota spectrum voice traffic involves protocol conversion see suf ¶   remains on careful consideration this court finds its reasoning persuasive relatedly defendants contend that the nonaccounting safeguards order has been “repudiated” defs’ mem in supp of mot for summ j doc no  “defs’ mem in supp” at  the court concluded otherwise in its motion to dismiss order and it sees no reason to reconsider that determination now see charter advanced  wl  at   while the reasoning of that order as well as the analytical framework it proposed may well have been supplemented in the years since its promulgation there is no reason to conclude it has been rejected by the fcc like vonage i it remains relevant to decision of this matter defendants’ other arguments require more careful consideration but the court likewise concludes that they do not suffice to render spectrum voice a telecommunications service first among these is the contention that charter advanced’s service is not an information service because it falls within the “telecommunications system management exception” the telecommunications act’s definition of “information services” excludes the use of any “capability for the management control or operation of a telecommunications system or the management of a telecommunications service”  usc §  this exception “covers services that may fit within the literal reading of the information services definition but that are used to facilitate the provision of a basic telecommunications service without altering the character of that service” nonaccounting safeguards order  fcc rcd at  ¶  in the nonaccounting safeguards order the fcc identified three categories of protocol processing services that fall within the telecommunications system management  exception  services “involving communications between an end user and the network itself eg for initiation routing and termination of calls rather than between or among users”  protocol processing “in connection with the introduction of a new basic network technology which requires protocol conversion to maintain compatibility with existing customer premises equipment “cpe”” and  services “involving internetworking conversions taking place solely within the carrier’s network to facilitate provision of a basic network service that result in no net conversion to the end user” id at  ¶  here defendants argue that all three categories apply to render spectrum voice subject to the telecommunications system management exception on review of the record the court cannot agree the first exception fairly plainly does not apply here—the purpose of iptdm protocol conversion at least as applied by spectrum voice is to facilitate communication between users of voip and legacy telephony services not simply to facilitate connection between the user and the network as to the second exception spectrum voice does not engage in protocol conversion simply to maintain backwards compatibility with old cpe indeed it has no need to do so as the relevant cpe—the emta—is new cpe provided to the customer for the express purpose of facilitating transmission in charter advanced’s chosen protocol ip the net protocol conversion that occurs comes much later in the process when the media gateway acts to provide a bridge to the pstn thus maintaining compatibility with cpe is not a concern here finally the “internetworking” exception is equally inapplicable as this court explained in its motion to dismiss order that exception applies where there is no net  protocol conversion such that the only conversion occurs on the carrier’s network for the carrier’s convenience see charter advanced  wl  at  thus where a call originates in tdm format is converted by the provider to ip format for transmission across its network and is converted a final time to tdm before being handed off to another provider the internetworking exception would apply see petition for declaratory ruling that att’s phonetophone ip telephony services are exempt from access charges  fcc rcd    ¶¶    “att order” defendants argue that spectrum voice provides protocol conversion solely on charter advanced’s own network and therefore is subject to the internetworking exception see defs’ mem in opp’n at  in their view phone calls involving spectrum voice originate in analog when the customer places a call and are then converted by the emta—which defendants characterize as part of charter advanced’s network—to ip for transmission across the network id because the phone call ultimately ends in analog when it is received by the call recipient defendants contend that there is no net protocol conversion to the end user and thus the only protocol conversion occurs within charter advanced’s network id this argument is flawed for the simple reason that it mischaracterizes the demarcation point of charter advanced’s network under fcc precedent cpe is by definition outside the carrier’s network see eg in re federalstate joint board on universal service  fcc rcd   ¶   “tribal recon order” defining cpe as “equipment that falls on the customer side of the demarcation point  between customer and network facilities” there is no dispute that the emta is cpe see vonage ii  fcc rcd at  ¶  describing vonage’s mta as “specialized cpe” because it is at the emta that the customer’s voice signal is converted from analog to ip as a matter of law the customer’s data must enter the network in that format  see suf ¶  thus any protocol conversion occurring as data leaves charter advanced’s network is net protocol conversion and not subject to the third nonaccounting safeguards order exception the mpuc also contends that spectrum voice falls under the telecommunications system management exception pursuant to the socalled “functional approach” to classification defs’ mem in supp at  as described in in re federalstate joint board on universal service  fcc rcd   “universal service report” the functional approach classifies a communications service based on what is functionally offered to the end user  fcc rcd  ¶  at the motion to dismiss stage this court declined to determine whether the functional approach was a more appropriate framework for analyzing spectrum voice than that propounded by the nonaccounting safeguards order instead determining that dismissal was unwarranted under either see charter advanced  wl  at  for similar reasons the court now finds that even if the functional approach is applied instead of or in addition to that set forth above spectrum voice qualifies as an  on this point the court notes that although the mpuc characterizes determination of the demarcation point for charter advanced’s network as a factual inquiry it is actually a legal one see defs’ mem in opp’n at   n thus even taking into consideration the opinions of defendants’ experts on the subject there is no factual dispute that would preclude entry of summary judgment here  information service as an initial matter it is important to recognize that the vast majority of spectrum voice customers do not purchase the service as a standalone offering see suf ¶¶  rather for most customers spectrum voice is an addon feature on top of charter advanced’s broadband internet and cable offerings—each of which is routed through the emta id at ¶  to these customers with broadband internet who wish to use their internet connection for voice communication protocol conversion is a necessity—without it they would be unable to interface with the pstn thus what charter advanced provides these individuals is the functionality necessary to utilize their internet connection for voice service  when combined with the provisioning of enhanced functionality eg voice online manager what is “functionally offered” to the consumer is an information service at a more granular level the mpuc contends that the fcc’s recent finding that various features provided in tandem with broadband internet service including domain name service “dns” and caching “fit squarely within the telecommunications systems management exception to the definition of an ‘information service’” mandates a similar result here see protecting and promoting the open internet  fcc rcd   ¶   “open internet order” the court initially rebuffed this argument at the motion to dismiss stage concluding that “there has been no determination that charter’s additional capabilities are analogous to dns and caching” charter advanced  wl  the fact that charter advanced may not specifically market spectrum voice’s protocol conversion functionality does not in this court’s view affect the functional analysis rather it is sufficient that charter advanced makes clear that its offering gives customers the ability to use their internet connection to talk to anyone with a phone connection   at  on this more developed record the court finds that the open internet order does not mandate the applicability of the telecommunications system management exception to spectrum voice at bottom the fcc determined that caching and dns were subject to the exception because they were “simply used to facilitate the transmission of information so that users can access other services” open internet order  fcc rcd at  ¶  the main benefit of those particular functions was enhanced network efficiency see id at  ¶  by contrast the purpose of iptdm protocol conversion is not to enhance the efficient operation of charter advanced’s network but rather to allow consumers to bridge different networks that function is critical to spectrum voice’s operation and the difference it entails is sufficient to vitiate any relevant similarities between the factual considerations in the open internet order and the matter before the court today iv conclusion for the above reasons the court concludes that charter advanced’s spectrum voice offering in an “information service” because inherent in its operation is the ability to engage in protocol conversion—thereby “transforming” the customer’s information for purposes of the telecommunications act of  see  usc §  accordingly state regulation of spectrum voice is preempted and impermissible see vonage i  f supp d at  because the court’s conclusion that summary judgment is warranted does not rest upon matters testified to by defendants’ expert dr robert loube charter advanced’s daubert motion need not be addressed and is  accordingly denied as moot therefore it is hereby ordered that  defendants’ motion for summary judgment doc no  is denied  plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment doc no  is granted and  plaintiffs’ motion to
