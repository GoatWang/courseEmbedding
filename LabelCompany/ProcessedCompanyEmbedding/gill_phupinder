who knows gill well and says cme is likely to keep considering acquisitions if necessary the company has missed a series of acquisition opportunities the latest being the london stock exchange which this month agreed to be acquired by deutsche boerse the foot gill  with a cap of jet black hair tinged gray doesnt seem the type to back down before coming to the us in the early s he played rugby for the singapore national team and his sikh heritage from punjabi grandparents is known for warrior skills and five items that sikh men traditionally wear bangle hair comb undergarment long hair and small dagger gill forgoes the last two the son of two teachers gill grew up with three languages other than english—malay a dialect of chinese called hokkien and a smattering of punjabi he says in an interview for college he applied to several schools in the us and ended up at washington state university in rural pullman wash partly because his older brother lived in seattle he earned a bachelors degree in finance in  and an mba in  then chicago caught his eye as a financial center he landed a job at the chicago board options exchange in  but he started on black monday and was laid off shortly after that market crash the next year he shifted across town to a job reporting prices from the trading pits on the floor of the chicago mercantile exchange there he faced a white maledominated environment where others principally served in supporting roles he explained in an appearance before the executives club of chicago this month but he didnt find the occasionally rude remarks on the trading floor any different from the kind of teasing he faced during his childhood in singapore “you get slammed and you get used to it and you learn how to insult back” he says “its just part of life so those of you that know me know me to have an acid tongue in that sense but i did not find chicago much different from too many places” mentors eventually gill segued to the exchanges clearing operation which acts as a kind of middleman in guaranteeing trades he climbed the ranks with help from a senior executive john davidson who became a mentor after davidson and other executives exited in the late s gill became “the unanimous choice” to lead the clearinghouse in  writes former cme chairman leo melamed in his  book “for crying out loud” another man who brought gill along at cme was the late fred arditti an early advocate of electronic trading and a former senior cme executive for whom depauls arditti center for risk management is named its led by luft and also partially funded by cme ardittis “style was always very accepting and he had the largest impact on who i am today” gill says gill also cited cme executive chairman terry duffy as a role model for his political savvy today gill leads a company that rang up  billion in revenue in  as a record  billion in futures contracts changed hands mainly across its expansive electronic global trading platform and to a much lesser degree on its shrinking trading floors in chicago that revenue was only slightly ahead of  after a threeyear dip tied in large part to low volume and low volatility in the us financial markets now gill is sending cme employees abroad to better understand foreign clients and the products they want to cultivate he says cme recognizes today that international clients are “a very big part” of its growth strategy while some countries especially those in asia have long kept foreigners out of their markets making it difficult for outsiders to buy or build a presence gill expects that to change in the nottoodistant future they will go through the same evolution other countries have where they ultimately realize allowing foreigners in and opening to broader markets is in their best interest gill says “through the years we have found greater success in hiring people from diverse cultures especially as we become more and more of a global firm” he says chicago board options
