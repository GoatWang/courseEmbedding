roland a controller and this controller is as good as that one i like this one better because of the separate modpitchbend wheels the keyboard also has the same size keys and nice velocity curves i also like the pads alot more because they are bigger and much more sensitive its well built as well works great with sonar great buy  nektar lx i initially purchased an lx and lx as stage controllers for a mainstage  setup for a popdance band i was attracted to the size weight look cost and features of the controllers i have a km spider pro stand and so the cost of the stand almost equals the cost of the keyboards so what to you get for  retail more than you can imagine the respective feels are as good as or better than every other controller in its class ive tried them all and the semiweighted action of the lx is more solid than any  key nonweighted keyboard currently available the same is true for the lx the action is very light but still solid enough to give enough feedback to make it fun to play they are not the same as a  controller but they are also not the weight or size if you need real piano feel or real b waterfall keys these are not the choice but if you need sturdy light and easy to use this is the ticket quick story i was playing an outside wedding a few weeks ago the cover for the band was not adequate and the sky opened up about halfway through the reception the ezup had a leak and water poured into the lx i quickly unplugged it as i tipped it to put it in the case water poured out i dried it out and fired it up for another wedding the next day there were a few oddities a mod wheel that was giving erratic values but it worked i emailed nektar and got a response the next day we exchanged a few emails and they offered to fix it or ship me the parts to fix it free of charge i elected to try to fix it and got the parts in a few days i put them in and everything is back to normal ive owned a lot of controllers including a yamaha kx a roland a and a roland apro these keyboards and this company have no peer if the nektar lx is as good as the older lx im getting one as soon as it is available  great ergonomics when i first played this keyboard the keyboard action felt very cheap especially compared to the smooth synth action of my old roland a which died after about  years but i got used to it very quickly and now i find its not bad at all i dont love any of the velocity curves id like the default curve to be weighted even more toward the middle and higher velocities but again not bad the pads are sensitive flexible and easy to program overall construction is just solid enough to not feel cheap its super lightweight and very thin the lx really shines as a controller though it has the most ergonomic control layout ive ever used and this is a big deal daw and vst synth integration is really well done too i use cubase this is the first controller ive owned where i might actually prefer the keyboard over the mouse for some functions time will tell advanced midi functions are all present not for use in the dark overall the lx gets top marks for ergonomics and offers great value for its asking price  my st dedicated controller being primarily a bass player not only is sound quality very important but also playability is equally important that said my initial impression of the lx was that it was sturdy to hold and seemed well constructed connection and integration was very easy now i also have a yamaha s synthcontroller but i have never used the controlling abilities of the s so my review of the nektar is based on no prior experience with a dedicated controller the lx controlling layout is well thought out and makes sense even for me everything works well and i can control my daw cubase  like a pro and have to remind myself i dont have to use the mouse much if at all the mixer is easy to call up and close the faders are substantial and dont feel weak in my digits the transport bar is awesome and the multi function buttons are a plus i created a page just to learn the controller and that proved to be a great idea so much so that when i am in songs that are in various stages of production i can blaze right thru the nektar is pretty easy to learn and is well worth the money but and this is where i must shift from praise to the thing that makes the nektar a good controller instead of a great controller the keys are weak i would be willing to pay an additional  for more substantial keys i find it hard to believe they put so much thought into designing a good board and stop at okay on the keys i must honestly say i think the keys will break of go out before anything else does  not bad at all it is a nice controller for my home studio very easy to assign to cubase  and vsts worth the
