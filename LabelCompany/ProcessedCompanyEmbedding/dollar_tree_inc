damage my home i purchased a pack of selfsticking picture hooks i brought them home read the back of the pack which by the way says exactly use to hang small pictures plaques gadgets utensils etc no tools or messy glue are needed to apply these easy to use hooks be sure mounting surface is free of grease dust  wax avoid hanging objects over tv sets stereos beds sofas or any expensive furniture so indirectly they warn you that items can fall off and harm someone or something but they never gave any kind of warning that the product could mess up surfaces i placed  of them on my wall to hang  pictures for my daughter which is what they are for i realized they were crooked so i tried to remove them to straighten them out i peeled slowly and carefully but they still took off layers of paint and wall i put a little bit of oil on the second one to help get it off without ruining yet another piece of wall unfortunately the this time was worse than the first piece i have always been careful not to put holes in my walls or anything like that and now i have  holes both  x  in one of my walls on top of that it is impossible to reach anyone in the company you can call the  number listed

business that the report is about this was a mistake on the consumers part by not applying the product in its intended place and having to reposition them the product worked so well that it adhesed itself to where removing it was difficult you cant ask for more than that in a hanger unless you make sure to specifically look for removeable hangers for a dollar sir you got very high quality one thing i can say negative about dollar tree is that their jarred island choice peaches require a vice to open report attachments respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  general comment i cant believe you would blame dollar tree author littleus  united states of america submitted tuesday august   posted tuesday august   i have to agree with the contractor on this matter the point that he made about leaving nail holes was classic i have myself purchased this specific hook from the dollar tree and found that it has done exactly what it is supposed to do the fact the it did not fall off actually suprised me because it was only a dollar it worked better than i expected if your wall was damaged that would be due to things that you did not greenbrier int or the dollar tree respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer suggestion here is the number you are looking for author movie mom  united states of america submitted wednesday july   posted wednesday july    if you are still looking for greenbrier int inc they are the dollar tree dist i called it first and it worked  they seemed nice enough to me  i hope you are able to get your problem resolved report attachments respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  general comment these work fine youre the problem author james  united states of america submitted tuesday november   posted tuesday november   as a paint contractor i have to add my two cents worth on this one  ive used these stickon picture hang ups many times  the product works fine  they are not made to be moved around they are made to stick and hang pictures  if you wanted the removable kind you should have gone to wal mart and bought the rubberized gummy removable ones for  if the package doesnt say easily moved with no damage to surfaces then dont expect it if youd nailed them in the wrong place would you blame them for your nail holes you cant blame the product because you cant read  by the way is this your first time at gluing pictures to a wall  expect paint damage at least and wall paper damage possibly and maybe even some drywall surface damage in the event that you didnt take the time to measure and attach your hangers where you wanted them in the first place  and contacting the company because you yanked them down and got some wall damage is ridiculous  do you expect them to send a crew to your house to patch and repaint your walls that you damaged jeeeezz lady calm down smear a little spackling paste over the damage or tooth paste works even and let it dry overnight sandpaper lightly then use a sponge to apply a couple dabs of paint and get over it your going to give yourself a heart attack over nothing  life is too short to go ballastic over your own little mistakes  james columbus ga usa respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  consumer comment you had the choice to use those stick ups or not to hang them up author joe  usa submitted monday february   posted monday february   i shop at the dollar general store all the time there are things that i would not use what sort of walls were you trying to hang these on you can use old english furniture polish to clean up problems with the wood paneling and some paint with a small roller to cover up minor problems in the wall me i just put my photos what few i have  on the bookcases and leave the walls blank but after the bad experience i had with the first one i dont think i would have used the second one there is a buyer beware warning implicit in everything you buy whether or not it comes from neimanmarcus or dollar tree or home depot once you put this stuff on the wall it is there and you cant change your mind cause bad things happen good luck in repairing your wall respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company report  rebuttal respond to this report file a rebuttal whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or
