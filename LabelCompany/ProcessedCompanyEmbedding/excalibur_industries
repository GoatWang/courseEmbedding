years has adopted a policy designed to husband the companys assets and retain as much of its mineral interests as possible taking into account the depressed market for uranium and excaliburs limited resources the company recognized that it would have to rely on royalty income from its most promising properties and that it had little if any control over when uranium producers with which it had royalty agreements would commence mining the records show that during the period of  to may   with exception of  the company had zero royalty income form k of the company for  indicates that the company received advanced royalty from uranerz energy corporation of  the lack of royalties was noted in excaliburs k annual report for  wherein it is stated that advanced payments ended in may  after which time no additional payments will be received until production commences other than interest income no other continuing material cash inflows are known to management or anticipated at this time based on current agreements the husbanding policy of the company was and is a survival policy which may have worked however the consequences are  the company does not have the core of employees with the knowledge necessary to monitor and manage its properties and mineral interests and mining operations of uranium producers with whom it has royalty agreements  the company has not had audited financial statements since  and cannot have a market for its shares without first attaining necessary financial audits for multiple years and compliance with all reporting standards of the securities and exchange commission at considerable expense to solve some of the foregoing problems the company on february   engaged meriden engineering llc a minnesota limited liability company situated in hibbing minnesota meriden to manage its administrative and leasehold affairs for both excalibur and mountain west the agreement requires annual budget to be prepared by meriden and submitted to the company for approval compensation is earned by meriden on an hourly basis for services performed at a rate of  per hour while meriden will issue monthly invoices for services rendered payment is not due until royalty payments commence and are received after commencement of royalty payments occurs meriden will prepare an annual budget for periods after the commencement of royalty payments and meridens compensation will be a management fee equal to  of the gross royalty revenue received by the company extraordinary events or issues beyond the scope of the budget will be negotiated between meriden and the company as additional compensation in addition as an incentive  of actual gross increase in the companys consolidated revenues during each calendar year from all sources other than royalties shall be paid to meriden in the event the company is sold all deferred compensation will be paid in full and in addition a onetime termination fee in the amount of  will be paid to meriden
