and charles christenson defendants and kenetech corporation nominal defendant court of chancery of delaware new castle county submitted april   decided july   attorneys appearing for the case edward m mcnally and john t meli jr morris james hitchens  williams llp wilmington for plaintiffs charles f richards jr raymond j dicamillo and thad j bracegirdle richards layton  finger wilmington for defendants opinion lamb vice chancellor i introduction in october  the largest holder of kenetech corporation common stock advised kenetechs president and ceo mark d lerdal who was also a director that it was shopping its  million share block over  of the common outstanding and meant to sell those shares by yearend the other directors also learned of these facts and considered purchasing the shares jointly they and lerdal also knew that the block could be acquired at a nominal price without formally meeting to analyze kenetechs options the directors failed to cause kenetech to take advantage of the opportunity to buy those shares rather in december  lerdal purchased the shares for a mere  plaintiffs robert l and louise a kohls who are kenetech stockholders filed this derivative action on february   seeking to enforce the companys right to purchase those shares the kohls assert that the  million kenetech shares were worth far more than  when purchased from hillman and are now valued at over  million the kohls allege that the opportunity to buy the shares belonged to kenetech and that lerdal breached his duty of loyalty by appropriating it for himself they also claim that the other directors breached their fiduciary duties to kenetech by their acquiescence in lerdals action and their failure properly to pursue and protect kenetechs interests in exploiting the opportunity presented by the time the kohls filed this action two of the directors had resigned from the kenetech board and been replaced with new outside directors a third charles a christenson remained on the kenetech board the defendants in this action filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and failure to comply with the demand requirement of rule  for the reasons set forth below i deny defendants motions ii factual background a the parties plaintiffs robert l and louise a kohls have purportedly been kenetech stockholders at all times relevant to this action nominal defendant kenetech is a delaware corporation with its principal office in san francisco california as of october   kenetech had  outstanding shares of common stock the hillman company which is not a party to this action held about  of those shares at the time of the events described herein defendant mark d lerdal has been a kenetech director and its president and ceo since  in  lerdal received a substantial cash severance payment from kenetech he was not however terminated defendant charles a christenson is now and has since  been a kenetech director defendants angus m duthie and gerald r alderson were the other two board members at the time of the matters alleged but terminated their directorial roles as of august   duthie and alderson were replaced on the kenetech board by two outside independent directors b the hillman offer kenetech historically operated in the electric utility market beginning in  kenetechs business deteriorated significantly over time kenetech sold off most of its assets and ceased most of its operations in june  kenetech defaulted on  million worth of its senior notes thus kenetech faced the threat of an involuntary bankruptcy in october  a hillman representative contacted lerdal stating that it was prepared to sell its approximately  million kenetech shares for a nominal price lerdal expressed his personal interest in such a transaction another hillman representative contacted one or more of the other directors who then discussed the possibility of all four kenetech directors jointly purchasing the shares lerdal discouraged these discussions in december hillman again contacted lerdal and told him that hillman had not found a buyer lerdal agreed to buy the shares for  and the transaction closed before yearend plaintiffs allege that at the thentrading price of  those shares were valued at over  it is alleged that the board never met to consider whether kenetech could or should take the opportunity to purchase the shares itself it is alleged however that lerdal told the other directors outside the context of a board meeting that kenetech could not purchase the shares for a variety of reasons all relating to its poor financial condition these reasons included the prohibition found in § a of the delaware general corporation law against a corporation repurchasing shares at a time when its capital is impaired restrictive covenants found in kenetechs senior notes and certain protective provisions of kenetechs charter relating to a series of preferred stock denominated as prides the complaint alleges that since the board never met to consider the question of repurchasing the block of shares it never obtained independent legal financial or accounting advice on the subject plaintiffs also allege that the reasons identified by lerdal did not in fact prevent kenetech from purchasing the shares c the ecoelectrica sale by the time of hillmans offer kenetech had soldoff a large part of its assets but retained its onehalf interest in an electric plant project called ecoelectrica in december  just prior to the challenged stock purchase kenetech obtained construction financing for the project thus increasing its value significantly in december  kenetech closed a sale of its ecoelectrica interest realizing  million in the transaction kenetechs market value has risen accordingly thus lerdals shares purchased from hillman for  are now worth well over  million iii the parties contentions the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the demand upon the board required by court of chancery rule  was neither made nor excused defendants concede lerdals interest in a demand but argue that the other  members of the man board of directors are disinterested and independent and therefore demand was required defendants point out that half of the kenetech board at the time of lerdals stock purchase has been replaced and argue that plaintiffs fail to show that christenson is either interested in that transaction or controlled by lerdal defendants also moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a valid corporate opportunity claim relying on the delaware supreme courts opinion in broz v cellular information systems inc first they say kenetechs capital was impaired so it could not statutorily repurchase its own shares second the provisions of its debt instruments prevented a repurchase third the prides certificate of designations prevented kenetech from repurchasing any of its common shares at a time the prides dividends were in arrears finally defendants argue kenetech had no expectancy in the opportunity for each of those reasons lerdal could purchase the shares without concern for kenetechs interest therein plaintiffs counter by arguing that lerdals usurpation of the extraordinary opportunity for kenetech to repurchase onethird of its shares for nominal consideration and the other directors complicity in the same evidences faithless conduct plaintiffs argue that kenetechs capital was impaired only because it carried its ecoelectrica investment at a mere  million book value the directors knew that ecoelectricas fair value was at least  million and that a revaluation would produce over  million in surplus plaintiffs also claim that no properly motivated director would believe that either the preferred stockholders or the senior notes holders would have prevented kenetech from making a  purchase of onethird of its stock first the prides holders had an interest in seeing the purchase made because they were imminently confronting a mandatory conversion into common second since the board had already obtained the senior notes holders consent to over  million in bonus payments to kenetechs officers it stood to reason that they would allow a mere  payment to buy the stock in any event since kenetech was already in default plaintiffs contend that those holders could attain no additional rights by virtue of an unauthorized  share repurchase further plaintiffs argue even if the prides holders and senior notes holders respective cooperation could not be presumed the opportunity to buy onethird of the company for  provided such a great benefit to kenetechs stockholders that the board was required to efficiently breach those contracts plaintiffs then argue that demand was excused at the time they filed their complaint because there was not a disinterested and independent majority of directors on whom to make such a demand lerdal is concededly conflicted because he actually bought the stock christenson is also conflicted plaintiffs argue because of his knowledge of the operative facts and his failure and that of defendants duthie and alderson to take steps to protect the interests of kenetech in making the purchase iv analysis a standards in order to survive a motion to dismiss under court of chancery rule b the complaint must allege facts that if true establish every element of a claim upon which relief can be granted for rule b purposes a complaint need only provide a short and plain statement of the facts supporting relief plaintiffs sue derivatively but did not make a presuit demand on the board rule  requires that the complaint allege with particularity the justification for not making a demand this heightened pleading standard exists because the derivative suit impinges on the managerial freedom of directors in order to assert a claim on behalf of the corporation a plaintiff stockholder must show that the directors are under an influence which sterilizes their discretion or are incapable of making an impartial decision regarding such litigation in aronson v lewis the delaware supreme court articulated a twopart test for demand excusal as a general rule demand is excused where the complaint alleges with particularity facts that establish a reasonable doubt that either a the directors are disinterested and independent or b the challenged transaction is otherwise the product of a valid exercise of the directors business judgment central to this analysis is the operation of the business judgment rule this is selfevident as to the second prong but it is equally true of the first as to the first prong inquiry directorial independence and disinterestedness the court reviews the factual allegations to decide whether they raise a reasonable doubt as a threshold matter that the protections of the business judgment rule are available to the board relatedly the aronson court also pronounced that the mere fact that directors would be asked to sue themselves is not a basis for excusing demand nor is it sufficient to allege that the directors had voted to approve the transaction at issue rather the complaint must allege specific facts establishing that the potential for liability is not a mere threat but instead may rise to a substantial likelihood these general statements may be seen as flowing from the premise that where business judgment protection is available a mere threat of personal liability resulting from ones participation as a director in approving a transaction should not suffice to sterilize a directors discretion the aronson court ruled as follows in sum the entire review is factual in nature the court of chancery in the exercise of its sound discretion must be satisfied that a plaintiff has alleged facts with particularity which taken as true support a reasonable doubt that the challenged transaction was the product of a valid exercise of business judgment only in that context is demand excused while aronsons focus on the business judgment rule serves well in most cases the delaware supreme court has recognized most notably in rales v blasband the existence of situations in which the aronson analysis cannot apply this is so for example where the absence of any action or decision on the part of the board to which the demand would be addressed makes it impossible to perform the essential inquiry contemplated by aronson — whether the presumption of the business judgment rule applies to the challenged transaction pertinently the rales court concluded that the aronson test should not be applied where the subject of the derivative suit is not a business decision of the board of course recognizing that the aronson test cannot be applied in a given situation does not lead the conclusion that demand is excused rather as the supreme court said in rales instead it is appropriate in these situations to examine whether the board that would be addressing the demand can impartially consider its merits without being influenced by improper considerations thus a court must determine whether or not the particularized factual allegations of a derivative stockholder complaint create a reasonable doubt that as of the time the complaint is filed the board of directors could have properly exercised its independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand if the derivative plaintiff satisfies this burden then demand will be excused as futile it has been observed that this simple and straightforward inquiry would seem to be the very issue that aronson in its more mechanical and roundabout way was intended to resolve moreover because this formulation is one of general application and can as easily be applied in the business judgment rule context addressed in aronson it is arguable that the current state of the law is conceptually inverted and that it would be both simpler and more direct to regard the original aronson analysis as a subpart of the more generally applicable and flexible principle set forth in rales for present purposes i need not wrestle with this last observation because i am persuaded by my review of the amended complaint and the parties arguments that the kenetech board of directors did not make a business decision in  regarding the purchase of the hillman block of shares by either kenetech or lerdal thus the aronson test is irrelevant and i will analyze the demand issue under the standard articulated in rales — whether the board can consider a demand without being influenced by improper considerations b can a majority of the kenetech board consider a demand it is uncontested that half of the present board is presumed capable of impartially considering a demand it is equally clear that lerdal is conflicted from doing so the question of demand futility thus turns on christenson  is christenson beholden to lerdal plaintiffs acknowledge that christenson was not financially interested in lerdals stock purchase nevertheless arguing by analogy to the first prong of aronson plaintiffs say that christenson is beholden to lerdal and thus not independent independence means that a directors decision is based on the corporate merits of the subject before the board rather than extraneous considerations or influences thus plaintiffs must show facts tending to suggest that christenson is so dependent on lerdal ordinarily by virtue of financial familial or other relationships as to sterilize his ability to consider a demand in this case plaintiffs present two reasons that allegedly prove lerdals domination of christenson first they point to christensons vote in favor of lerdals generous severance agreement that was paid to lerdal despite the fact that he did not leave or change his job with the company and that provided for kenetech to pay his taxes with respect to that benefit i cannot conclude that christensons vote on this matter shows his domination by lerdal first agreements of this nature are not entirely uncommon and there is nothing inherently improper about them more importantly christenson an outside director was simply one of a unanimous board other than lerdal to approve the transaction finally christensons ability to control or influence control over lerdals compensation would ordinarily be more suggestive of his domination and control over lerdal not the opposite inference suggested by plaintiffs here plaintiffs second argument is that christensons conduct with respect to the challenged transaction is so inexplicable that it supports an inference that lerdal controls him i agree that the unusual nature of the corporate opportunity described in the complaint is properly considered in weighing whether or not christenson is conflicted for purposes of considering a demand however this argument will be considered as part of the second part of my rales inquiry discussed below  is christenson interested in the demand itself although christenson is neither interested in the challenged transaction nor beholden to lerdal the demand futility analysis is not complete is christenson by virtue of a substantial threat of personal liability interested in the decision to bring the litigation so as to leave him conflicted from impartially evaluating a demand on the basis of the matters properly alleged in the complaint i conclude that he is this case presents a highly unusual set of facts that color my decision on this motion the complaint does not allege merely the opportunity to repurchase shares of stock at market price rather the complaint alleges the forfeiture or usurpation of an opportunity for the corporation to realize a substantial windfall for the benefit of its stockholders • the companys ceo learned that its  shareholder was anxious to sell its position and was willing to do so for next to nothing the ceo wanted to buy the shares himself the other members of the board of directors also learned of this opportunity and jointly considered purchasing it in their personal capacities • the ceo consulted with counsel and gave the other directors a series of reasons why the company could not buy the shares the complaint alleges in a conclusory fashion that these reasons were false on their face and could not have been believed by the others including christenson moreover it is alleged that christenson and i infer the board as a whole failed to obtain competent legal financial or accounting advice the ceo then convinced the others to let him take the deal alone those shares were allegedly worth many times the price paid for them and are now worth over  times their cost to the ceo plaintiffs argue that christenson faces a substantial threat of personal liability because his inexplicable indifference to the interests of the company in this matter implicates his duty of loyalty to kenetech and  amounts to bad faith plaintiffs also argue that a directors duty of loyalty may also be implicated where directors who do not benefit from a transaction nevertheless act with indifference to their duty to protect the interests of the corporation and its minority shareholders put simply plaintiffs assert that no properly motivated director could have perceived this corporate opportunity and not thoroughly inquired into the companys ability to exploit it later in this opinion i deny defendants motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for usurpation of a corporate opportunity suffice it to say for now that i am satisfied that the complaint does state a claim against all of the defendants relating to lerdals alleged usurpation of a corporate opportunity even applying rule s heightened pleading standard i conclude that the allegations of the complaint if true would establish that christenson faces a substantial likelihood of personal liability for breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting lerdals breach of duty in broz v cellular information systems inc the supreme court made clear that the failure to formally present an opportunity to the corporate board cannot be the sole basis for imposing liability i take this to mean that by analogy a boards failure formally to consider an opportunity does not alone amount to a breach of duty on the directors part nevertheless the kenetech boards apparent acceptance of lerdals assertions at face value without conducting any independent analysis or seeking independent advice tends to show a disregard for corporate interests after all independent accountants and lawyers may have been able to structure an acceptable transaction for kenetech in the context of the wellpleaded allegations of the complaint particularly the highly valuable nature of the opportunity to kenetech and its stockholders i am satisfied that christenson is conflicted for purposes of considering a demand since only half of the present board is capable of impartially considering a demand such exercise is excused as futile c does the complaint state a claim for usurpation of a corporate opportunity giving fair consideration to the arguments of the parties i conclude that the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted within the meaning of rule b thus i do not accept at this stage of the proceedings defendants multiple explanations why the corporate opportunity doctrine is not relevant to this case the basic framework of delawares corporate opportunity doctrine was laid down by the delaware supreme court in guth v loft inc as follows if there is presented to a corporate officer or director a business opportunity which the corporation is financially able to undertake is from its nature in the line of the corporations business and is of practical advantage to it is one in which the corporation has an interest or a reasonable expectancy and by embracing the opportunity the selfinterest of the officer or director will be brought into conflict with that of his corporation the law will not permit him to seize the opportunity for himself of course as the supreme court recently recognized because corporate opportunity cases arise in widely varying factual contexts hard and fast rules are not easily crafted to deal with such an array of complex situations the peculiar facts of this case involving a particularly striking opportunity for the corporation to benefit its stockholders would seem to present a sufficiently substantial question of fiduciary misconduct to survive a motion to dismiss defendants advance several arguments however that they say require dismissal first defendants argue that because kenetech did not have in place any policy or plan for repurchasing its stock kenetech had no cognizable expectancy in the hillman offer next defendants say that section  of the dgcl the contractual limitations in the notes and the prides certificate of designations barred kenetech from repurchasing its own shares finally defendants assert that the opportunity was presented to lerdal in his individual capacity and not as a director i take each argument in turn  kenetechs expectancy in the opportunity first defendants argue that the hillman offer was not the type of opportunity that delaware law requires be presented to the corporation defendants say that because kenetech had no share repurchase program in effect hillmans offer did not constitute an opportunity in the companys line of business defendants cite to equity corp v milton which can be read to stand for the proposition that a corporation may have no expectancy in receiving an opportunity to buy a block of its own stock at market prices unsurprisingly neither that case nor any other holds that a delaware corporation has no expectancy in being presented with an opportunity to repurchase a large block of its own stock for little or no consideration thus providing nearly costfree returns to its stockholders and i need no authority to conclude otherwise the question then is whether plaintiffs allege that kenetech could have taken advantage of that opportunity  section  a delaware corporation may not repurchase its own shares when the capital of the corporation is impaired or when such purchase or redemption would cause impairment of the capital of the corporation a surplus exists meaning that the capital is not impaired when the net assets of a corporation exceed its total liabilities defendants argue that kenetechs capital was impaired in the amount of  thus kenetech could not purchase hillmans shares even if it wanted to do so at first blush this is a substantial impediment to kenetechs ability to take advantage of the opportunity presented nevertheless the wellpleaded allegations of the complaint taken as true show that this balance sheet capital account deficit would not have prevented kenetech from acting this is so because the ecoelectrica project was being carried at a low book value and it is alleged christenson and the rest of the board believed that its actual worth could exceed  million further on december   kenetech obtained financing for the project thus making more likely an ultimate realization of a substantial sale price for the asset the complaint alleges that if the board revalued its assets to reflect the market value of ecoelectrica it could have eliminated the capital deficit and thus avoided the obstacle to a repurchase presented by section a certainly a corporation may revalue properly its assets and liabilities to show a surplus and thus conform to the statute for these reasons neither lerdal nor the other defendants can claim at this stage that section  really represented a barrier to a  stock repurchase by kenetech  the senior notes restriction because of its default in payment on the senior notes kenetech was contractually restricted from repurchasing its own shares for value defendants argue that this contractual provision barred kenetech from taking advantage of the hillman offer yet the senior notes holders had already waived their rights in allowing bonus payments in excess of  million to kenetechs officers thus the complaint alleges there was reason to believe that the holders of the senior notes would not have objected to kenetechs paying  to repurchase the hillman block of common stock additionally the restrictions found in the senior notes indenture are not necessarily as forbidding as defendants suggest for example kenetech could complete any purchase or redemption  made by exchange for or out of the substantially concurrent sale of capital stock of the company at least at this stage of the proceeding it is fair to infer that some means of effectuating the transaction without violating the senior notes indenture could have been arranged by a properly motivated and counseled board of directors i recognize that in broz the supreme court held on posttrial appeal that the corporation could not take the opportunity presented in part because certain note restrictions severely limited the discretion of cis as to the acquisition of new assets and substantially restricted the ability of cis to incur new debt that may ultimately prove to be the case here too but in the context of this motion to dismiss i draw a contrary inference based on the wellpleaded allegations of the complaint and the terms of the indenture  the prides certificate since kenetech was in arrears in paying dividends on the prides kenetech was prohibited by section c of the prides certificate of designations from repurchasing its own shares pertinently this provides that no shares of any junior stock may be purchased redeemed or otherwise acquired by the corporation or any of its subsidiaries except in connection with a reclassification or exchange of any junior stock through the issuance of other junior stock  whenever full dividends on the prides have not been paid of course reliance on this provision to require dismissal of plaintiffs claim requires a certain ironic sensibility the restriction against common share repurchases was undoubtedly included in the prides certificate to protect the holders of those senior securities against depredation by the junior ie common stockholders yet based on the wellpleaded allegations of the complaint i must conclude at this stage of the proceedings that the prides holders were substantially harmed by kenetechs failure to purchase the hillman block of shares this is so because the prides were facing mandatory conversion into common shares on may   had the repurchase and retirement of the hillman block reduced the amount of outstanding common the prides holders would have received in the mandatory conversion a substantially greater percentage of the common equity as with the senior notes indenture i am unable at this stage of the case to conclude with assurance that the prides certificate of designation presented such an obstacle to kenetechs repurchase of the hillman block as to require dismissal in this regard i rely in part on the fact that the prides certificate is a part of the corporations certificate of incorporation and is subject to amendment in accordance with section  of the dgcl defendants are correct that a repurchase in violation of the certificate would constitute an ultra vires act however as plaintiffs point out kenetech could have tried to get an amendment of the certificate between october and december  alternatively had the board actually considered its options and obtained advice skilled counsel might have suggested some other mechanism to avoid the problems posed by the certificate put simply the certificate does not present such a clear barrier to taking the opportunity as to require dismissal of the complaint rather plaintiffs must be given the opportunity to prove their allegation  the capacity in which lerdal received the offer the complaint does not expressly allege that lerdal became aware of the opportunity to purchase the hillman block in his capacity as a president and ceo of kenetech nevertheless considering all of the relevant wellpleaded allegations of the complaint it is fair to draw such an inference for example paragraph  alleges that on or about october of  lerdal was advised that a stockholder of kenetech hillman company was shopping the block and was going to sell it in  the same paragraph goes on to allege that the other individual defendants were also advised that the block was for sale and considered jointly purchasing it when questioned at oral argument defendants counsel properly conceded that in the circumstances it is reasonable to infer that the offer was made to lerdal specifically because he was the president and ceo of the company thus i will not consider this argument further    for the reasons stated above plaintiffs adequately allege against lerdal a claim for improper usurpation of a corporate opportunity for the same reasons i conclude that it states a claim for relief against the other defendants who knowingly acquiesced in lerdals alleged usurpation and failed to takes steps to protect kenetechs interest in purchasing the shares itself v conclusion in summary plaintiffs have established that demand under court of chancery rule  is excused because they have shown that half of the present kenetech board is unable to impartially consider any such demand further i conclude that the complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted against each person named as a defendant accordingly i have today entered an order denying the motion to dismiss

quoting rales  ad at   id at  rales also recognized that the aronson test cannot be applied where a business decision was made by the board of a company but a majority of the directors making that decision have been replaced by the time the complaint is filed id at  here only  of the  directors had been replaced in the interim period thus all other things being equal the aronson test could still be applied in this case to assess whether the remaining directors — lerdal and christenson — are conflicted for purposes of considering a demand finally rales recognized that the aronson test should not apply where the decision being challenged was made by the board of directors of a different corporation id  id at  emphasis added  wolfe  pittenger § biii   id  rales  ad at   see beneville v york delch ca no   ad  strine vc  holding that where half the board is conflicted demand is excused  rales  ad at   aronson  ad at   see generally white v panic delch ca no  mem op at   wl  lamb vc jan    levine v smith delsupr  ad     see rales  ad at  holding that director whose substantial compensation from his position with a different corporation may be controlled by an interested defendant is considered beholden and conflicted from considering a demand  in a way this inquiry is related to the second prong of the aronson test under aronson the court determines whether the defendant will enjoy the protection from liability that exists when the business judgment rule stands unrebutted if those protections will not apply the court will infer that the director will be unable to consider impartially the corporations interest in bringing the litigation because of his own interest in avoiding that litigation relatedly when there is no challenge to a business judgment as is the case here the question becomes whether the director faces a substantial threat of personal liability due to his alleged conduct or lack thereof  the fact that the complaint is not particularly pleaded in this regard does not require dismissal rather i consider only the particularly pleaded facts in the complaint and analyze whether as a matter of law the hurdles identified by lerdal are valid  pl ans br at  quoting strassburger v earley del ch ca no   wl  jacobs vc jan    aronson delsupr  ad at   defendants assert that because this court can simply require lerdal to transfer the shares to the company as a remedy christenson does not face personal liability defendants misinterpret the complaint which clearly requests to the extent the stock cannot be transferred that all of the defendants be held jointly and severally liable to kenetech  delsupr  ad   n    guth v loft inc delsupr  ad     broz v cellular information systems inc delsupr  ad     delsupr  ad     del c § a  §   klang v smiths food
