the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership like a corporation the owners of an llc are not personally liable for business debts like a sole proprietorship or partnership an llc has operating flexibility and is a passthrough entity for tax purposes this means the llcs profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the llc what legal documents do i need to form an llc to
