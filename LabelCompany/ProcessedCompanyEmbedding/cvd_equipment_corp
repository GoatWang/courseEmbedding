of chemical vapor deposited three dimensional graphene products that will be marketed under the trade name cvd d graphene™ and is expected to enable new high performance products karlheinz strobl vp of business development states “the cvd d graphene™ cellular material platform is based on a three dimensional graphenefoam like material having several two dimensional a few atomic layers thick graphene sheets that are mechanically and electrically fully interconnected in three dimensions this novel highly customizable material platform enables the preservation of many of the high performance material properties of the traditional one atom thick two dimensional graphene sheets such three dimensional graphene materials can be further functionalized by chemical vapor deposition electro deposition andor chemical grafting to develop even more advanced materials for high performance product developments this new nanomaterial platform interconnects the two dimensional nano world with the three dimensional macroscopic world of products in a more manufacturable manner the novel material platform is already being explored by innovators for a growing range of product applications it is anticipated that as additional variations of the material are developed more growth market opportunities will become available”  cvd materials corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of cvd equipment corporation that focuses on providing a range of nanoenabled materials and products” said leonard rosenbaum president “by leveraging our custom equipment design and manufacturing capabilities with the process development and manufacturing capabilities of our application laboratory cvd materials corporation can optimally focus on shortening the time to market for novel nanoenhanced material products with the commercialization of cvd d graphene™ cellular materials using a range of nickel foam templates and by tuning the thickness of the carbon film layers we can

are saying about our systems i built two cvd systems when setting up my lab they were basically clones of a system i had used previously so the design was already in my mind and mostly down on paper however i severely underestimated the time involved in selecting all the proper pieces and parts by the time things finally came together and the first system came online i found myself wishing i had simply purchased complete solutions from a company that had already invested the time to engineer a reliable system as a new faculty member funds are a limited resource but time is even more so quickly getting the ball rolling on research is worth more than what one might save with a homebuilt approach  erik einarsson phd assistant professori am glad to share with you the good news that ever since the very first batch of samples we continued to produce long and uniform silicon nanowires suffice to say that members of our research group are all impressed with the turnkey reliability as well as extensive safety features of this lpcvd system which greatly satisfy the needs of our fundamental research program in nanomaterials we also appreciate the custom system design effort to cater to our needs from your  expert team and your ability to deliver and install in a timely manner  jie xiang assistant professor of electrical and computer engineeringthe fncvd application  research lab

nanowire growths  yi gu phd assistant professor of physics  gu research groupthe researchers at the university of cincinnati partnered with firstnano® a division of cvd equipment corp of ronkonkoma ny to use their laboratory and a specialized furnace called easytube®   with this equipment the research team succeeded to produce  millimeter long cnt array which is considered the longest aligned cnts reported ever  dr vesselin shanov associate professor of chemical and materials engineering it has been a pleasurable interaction with the firstnano® process and development team collectively collaborations between the cornell nanoscale facility and firstnano® have yielded single wall carbon nanotube growth from lithographically defined catalyst pads on full four inch wafers incorporating wafer scale nanoscale fabrication processes with predefined carbon based systems represents a major step forward in creating complex carbon based nanostructures this enhanced functionality raises intriguing possibilities in modern scientific research of widely disparate endeavors  b rob ilic phd research associate  user program managerthe purchase of the easytube®  will enlarge the spectrum of
