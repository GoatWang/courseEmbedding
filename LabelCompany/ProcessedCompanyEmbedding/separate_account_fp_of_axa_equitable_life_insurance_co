normal circumstances the removed portfolio invests at least  of its net assets in the equity securities of us large capitalization companies and the replacement portfolio invests at least  of its net assets in equity securities primarily investing in the securities of large capitalization growth companies but also investing to a lesser extent in the equity securities of small and midcapitalization growth companies although the replacement portfolio may invest in a broader range of companies to a greater extent than the removed portfolio both portfolios seek to achieve the same longterm investment goal by emphasizing investments in large capitalization us companies  each portfolio invests primarily in common stocks but may invest in other securities that its respective advisers believe provide opportunities for capital growth such as preferred stocks warrants and securities convertible into common stock in addition each portfolio may invest in derivatives the removed portfolio may invest up to approximately  of its net assets in futures and options while the replacement portfolio may invest up to  of its net assets in derivatives such as exchangetraded futures and options contracts on indices or other similar instruments  to achieve its investment objectives each portfolio combines active and passive management strategies with respect to each portfolio axa equitable allocates approximately  of the portfolios net assets to a portion of the portfolio that seeks to achieve the total return performance of an index the russell  growth index in the case of the removed portfolio and the russell  growth index for the replacement portfolio while maintaining as minimal tracking error as possible “index allocated portion” the russell  growth index includes those russell  companies the  largest companies of the russell  index with higher pricetobook ratios and higher forecasted growth values while the russell  growth index includes those russell  companies the  largest us securities with higher pricetobook ratios and higher forecasted growth values the russell  growth index generally has greater exposure to small and midcapitalization companies than the russell  growth index and thus has greater exposure to the risks of investing in such companies however the average weighted market capitalization of each portfolio is almost the same approximately  billion for the russell  growth index and approximately  billion for the russell  growth index each as of december    with respect to each portfolio axa equitable allocates the remaining  of the portfolios net assets among the other portions of the portfolio that are actively managed by multiple advisers the “active allocated portions” utilizing similar growth style strategies the active allocated portions of each portfolio may invest to a limited extent in illiquid securities and in securities of foreign companies including companies based in developing countries the replacement portfolios active allocated portions may invest up to  of their total assets in foreign securities the active allocated portions of the removed portfolio also may invest in foreign securities to a limited extent but have no stated limit given the similarity between the portfolios holdings and investment objectives and strategies the trust intends to retain the advisers to the active allocated portions of the removed portfolio to manage the assets of the active allocated portions of the removed portfolio that are transferred to the replacement portfolio in connection with the substitution  the portfolios have substantially similar risk profiles each portfolio is subject to the following principal risks derivatives risk equity risk index strategy risk largecap company risk and leverage risk the primary differences between the principal risks of the portfolios are that the replacement portfolio also is subject to foreign securities risk which is not a principal risk of the removed portfolio and the removed portfolio also is subject to investment style risk which is not a principal risk of the replacement portfolio however the section  applicants do not believe that these differences are significant while the replacement portfolio has the flexibility to invest in foreign securities to a greater extent than the removed portfolio each portfolios investments in foreign securities generally have been limited to a relatively small percentage of the portfolios assets for instance as of may   the removed and replacement portfolios had invested approximately  and  respectively in foreign securities in addition while the removed portfolio is subject to investment style risk because its advisers primarily utilize growth investing styles both of the portfolios seek longterm growth of capital invest in similar types of securities and generally are classified by third party mutual fund rating organizations as aggressive equity portfolios eg morningstar currently classifies each portfolio as a large cap growth portfolio  as provided in the chart below the section  applicants anticipate that the replacement portfolios total annual operating expense ratio taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements will be lower than that of the removed portfolio immediately after the substitution the chart below compares the advisory fees and total annual operating expenses of the class a and class b shares of the removed portfolio and the replacement portfolio for the fiscal year ended december   class a shares of each

portfolio multimanager aggressive equity portfolio class a percentmanagement fee rule b feeother expensestotal expenses as of december   the assets of the replacement portfolio were approximately  billion while the assets of the removed portfolio were approximately  million  the section  applicants currently expect that the proposed substitution will be carried out on or about august   or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter “substitution date” and by supplements to the prospectuses for the contracts and separate accounts which were delivered to contract owners and participants at least thirty  days before the proposed substitution each insurance company will notify all contract owners and participants of its intention to take the necessary actions including seeking the order requested by the application to substitute shares of the replacement portfolio for the removed portfolio as described herein the supplements advised contract owners and participants that from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed substitution contract owners and participants are permitted to make transfers of contract value or annuity unit value out of a removed portfolio subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfers or exchanges being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge as applicable the supplements also will inform contract owners and participants that the insurance companies will not exercise any rights reserved under any contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least  days after the proposed substitution the supplement also will advise contract owners and participants how to instruct the relevant insurance company if so desired in light of the proposed substitution to reallocate contract value from a removed portfolio subaccount to any other subaccount available for investment under their contracts in addition the supplements will advise contract owners and participants that any contract value remaining in a removed portfolio subaccount on the substitution date will be transferred to a replacement portfolio subaccount and that the proposed substitution will take place at relative net asset value the supplements will also advise contract owners and participants that for at least  days following the proposed substitution the insurance companies will permit contract owners and participants to make transfers of contract value or annuity unit value out of a replacement portfolio subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfers or exchanges being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge as applicable  each insurance company also has sent or will send contract owners and participants prospectuses for the replacement portfolio prior to the substitution the section  applicants have sent or will send the appropriate prospectus supplement or other notice in the case of contracts no longer actively marketed and for which there are a relatively small number of existing contract owners or participants containing this disclosure to all existing contract owners and participants prospective purchasers and new purchasers of contracts will be provided with a contract prospectus and the supplement containing disclosure regarding the proposed substitution as well as a prospectus and supplement for the replacement portfolio the contract prospectus and supplement and the prospectus and supplement for the replacement portfolio will be delivered to purchasers of new contracts in accordance with all applicable legal requirements  in addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to contract owners and participants within five business days after the substitution date contract owners and participants will be sent a written notice of the substitution informing them that the substitution was carried out and that they may transfer all contract value or cash value under a contract in a subaccount invested in the replacement portfolio on the date of the notice to one or more other subaccounts available under their contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among the variable account options the notice will also reiterate that other than with respect to implementing policies and procedures designed to prevent start printed page disruptive transfers and other market timing activity each insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or to the extent transfer charges apply to a contract to impose any charges on transfers until at least  days after the substitution date the insurance companies will also send each contract owner and participant a current prospectus for the replacement portfolio if they have not previously received a current version  each insurance company also is seeking approval of the proposed substitution from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate the proposed substitution will take place at relative net asset value determined on the substitution date pursuant to section  of the  act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owners or participants contract value cash value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the separate accounts the proposed substitution will be effected by redeeming shares of the removed portfolio in cash andor inkind on the substitution date at their net asset value and using the proceeds of those redemptions to purchase shares of the replacement portfolio at their net asset value on the same date all inkind redemptions will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the noaction letter issued by the staff of the commission to signature financial group inc pub avail dec    moreover the section  applicants state that contract owners and participants will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitution nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the insurance companies obligations under the contracts be altered in any way consequently all expenses incurred in connection with the proposed substitution including any brokerage legal accounting and other fees and expenses will be paid by the insurance companies in addition the proposed substitution will not impose any tax liability on contract owners or participants the proposed substitution will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by contract owners and participants to be greater after the substitution than before the substitution all contractlevel fees will remain the same after the substitution in addition because the substitution will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing the number of permissible transfers under the contracts no fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the substitution  the section  applicants represent that with respect to those contract owners or participants on the date of the substitution the insurance companies will reimburse the subaccounts investing in the replacement portfolio for a period of two years after the date of the substitution on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter such that the sum of the replacement portfolios total operating expense ratio taking into account any expense waivers and reimbursements and subaccount expense ratio assetbased fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculations of subaccount unit value for such period will not exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the removed portfolios total operating expense ratio taking into account any expense waivers and reimbursements and subaccount expense ratio for fiscal year  applicants legal analysis  section c of the  act prohibits the depositor of a registered unit investment trust that invests in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without commission approval section c provides that “the commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title”  the section  applicants assert that the proposed substitution involves a substitution of securities within the meaning of section c of the  act and therefore request an order from the commission pursuant to section c approving the proposed substitutions  the section  applicants state they have reserved the right under the contracts to substitute shares of another underlying investment option for one of the current underlying investment options offered as a funding option under the contracts both to protect themselves and their contract owners and participants in situations where either might be harmed or disadvantaged by events affecting the issuer of the securities held by a separate account and to preserve the opportunity to replace such shares in situations where a substitution could benefit the insurance companies and their respective contract owners and participants  the section  applicants argue that the removed portfolio and the replacement portfolio have identical investment objectives and substantially similar investment policies and risks in addition the section  applicants clarify that the proposed substitution retains for contract owners and participants the investment flexibility that is a central feature of the contracts the section  applicants assert that any impact on the investment programs of affected contract owners and participants including the appropriateness of the available investment options should therefore be negligible  furthermore the section  applicants claim that the substitution will permit the insurance companies to present information to their contract owners and participants in a simpler and more concise manner it is anticipated that after the substitution contract owners and participants will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under their contracts  in addition the section  applicants point out that as a result of the proposed substitution contract owners and participants with subaccount balances currently invested in the removed portfolio will have a lower total operating expense ratio after the substitution as contract owners or participants with subaccount balances invested in the replacement portfolio in this regard each insurance company has agreed to impose certain expense limits as discussed earlier in the application to ensure that contract owners and participants do not incur higher expenses as a result of the substitution for a period of two years after the substitution  in addition to the foregoing the section  applicants generally submit that the proposed substitution meets the standards that the commission and its staff have applied to similar substitutions that the commission previously has approved the section  applicants also submit that the proposed substitution is not of the type that section c was designed to prevent unlike traditional unit investment trusts where a depositor could only substitute investment securities in a manner that permanently affected all the investors in the trust the contracts provide each contract owner or participant with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer contract values and cash values into and among other investment options available to contract owners or participants under their contracts start printed page additionally the section  applicants assert that the proposed substitution will not reduce in any manner the nature or quality of the available investment options  moreover the section  applicants will offer contract owners and participants the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty other than those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to prevent disruptive transfer and other market timing activity that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the supplement notifying contract owners and participants of the proposed substitution and ending no earlier than thirty  days after the substitution the proposed substitution therefore will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that section c was designed to prevent  the section  applicants also note that the proposed substitution is also unlike the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a contract or participating in a group contract contract owners and participants select much more than a particular underlying fund in which to invest their contract values they also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by the section  applicants under the applicable contract as well as numerous other rights and privileges set forth in the contract contract owners and participants also may have considered the insurance companys size financial condition and its reputation for service in selecting their contract these factors will not change as a result of the proposed substitution nor will the annuity life or tax benefits afforded under the contracts held by any of the affected contract owners or participants  the section  applicants request an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from the provisions of section a of the  act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the inkind transactions in connection with the proposed substitution  section a of the  act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the  act generally prohibits the same persons acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company  section b of the  act provides that the commission may upon application issue an order exempting any proposed transaction from the provisions of section a if i the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned ii the proposed transactions are consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned and iii the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act  the removed portfolio and the replacement portfolio may be deemed to be affiliated persons of one another or affiliated persons of an affiliated person shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company thus the insurance companies and their affiliates collectively own substantially all of the shares of the trust accordingly the trust and its respective portfolios may be deemed to be under the control of the insurance companies notwithstanding the fact that the contract owners and participants may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the separate accounts if the trust is under the common control of the insurance companies then each insurance company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of the trust and its respective portfolios if the trust and its respective portfolios are under the control of the insurance companies then the trust and its respective affiliates are affiliated persons of the insurance companies  regardless of whether the insurance companies can be considered to control the trust and its portfolios the insurance companies may be deemed to be affiliated persons of the trust and its portfolios including the removed portfolio and the replacement portfolio because the insurance companies which are under common control and their affiliates own of record more than  of the outstanding shares likewise each of the trusts portfolios may be deemed to be an affiliated person of each insurance company as a result of these relationships the removed portfolio may be deemed to be an affiliated person of an affiliated person the insurance companies or the separate accounts of the replacement portfolio and vice versa  the proposed inkind transactions could be seen as the indirect purchase of shares of the replacement portfolio with portfolio securities of the removed portfolio and the indirect sale of portfolio securities of the removed portfolio for shares of the replacement portfolio pursuant to this analysis the proposed inkind transactions also could be categorized as a purchase of shares of the replacement portfolio by the removed portfolio acting as principal and a sale of portfolio securities by the removed portfolio acting as principal to the replacement portfolio in addition the proposed inkind transactions could be viewed as a purchase of securities from the removed portfolio and a sale of securities to the replacement portfolio by each insurance company or the separate accounts acting as principal if categorized in this manner the proposed inkind transactions may be deemed to contravene section a due to the affiliated status of these participants  the section  applicants assert that the inkind transactions will be effected at the respective net asset values of the removed portfolio and the replacement portfolio as determined in accordance with the procedures disclosed in the registration statement for the trust and as required by rule c under the  act the inkind transactions will not change the dollar value of any contract owners or participants investment in any of the separate accounts the value of any contract the accumulation value or other value credited to any contract or the death benefit payable under any contract immediately after the proposed inkind transactions the value of a separate accounts investment in the replacement portfolio will equal the value of its investments in the removed portfolio together with the value of any preexisting investments in the replacement portfolio immediately before the inkind transactions  rule a under the  act exempts from the prohibitions of section a subject to certain enumerated conditions a purchase or sale transaction between registered investment companies or separate series of registered investment companies which are affiliated persons or affiliated persons of affiliated persons of each other between separate series of a registered investment company or between a registered investment company or a separate series of a registered investment company and a person which is an affiliated person of such registered investment company or affiliated person of such person solely by reason of having a common investment adviser or investment advisers which are affiliated persons of start printed page each other common directors andor common officers  however one of the conditions enumerated in rule a requires that the transaction be a purchase or sale for no consideration other than cash payment against prompt delivery of a security for which market quotations are readily available if the proposed inkind transactions are viewed as purchases and sales of securities the consideration in the proposed redemptions of shares of the removed portfolio and the proposed purchases of shares of the replacement portfolio would not be cash but rather the portfolio securities received from the removed portfolio  the section  applicants will ensure that the trust will carry out the proposed inkind transactions in conformity with the conditions of rule a except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold will not be cash  for the reasons stated above the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind transactions including the consideration to be paid and received as described in the application are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned furthermore the section  applicants represent that the proposed inkind transactions will be consistent with the policies of the removed and corresponding replacement portfolios as recited in their respective current registration statements and that the proposed inkind transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act and do not present any conditions or abuses that the  act was designed to prevent conclusion for the reasons set forth in the application the applicants each respectively request that the commission issue an order of approval pursuant to section c of the  act and an order of exemption pursuant to section b of the  act start signature for the commission by the division of investment

levels of premiums relative to the amount of your policys insurance coverage also if your premium payments exceed certain other amounts specified under the internal revenue code your policy will become a modified endowment contract which may subject you to additional taxes and penalties on any distributions from your policy see tax information later in this prospectus we may return any premium payments that would exceed those limits to you you can ask your financial professional to provide you with an illustration of policy benefits that shows you the amount of premium you can pay based on various assumptions without exceeding these tax law limits the tax law limits can change as a result of certain changes you make to your policy for example a reduction in the face amount of your policy may reduce the amount of premiums that you can pay if at any time when your policys account value is high enough that the alternative death benefit discussed later in this prospectus would apply we reserve the right to limit the amount of any premiums that you pay unless the insured person provides us with adequate evidence that heshe continues to meet our requirements for issuing insurance planned periodic premiums page  of your policy will specify a planned periodic premium this is the amount that you request us to bill you however payment of these or any other specific amounts of premiums is not mandatory you need to pay only the amount of premiums if any necessary to keep your policy from lapsing and terminating as discussed below the minimum amount of premiums you must pay policy lapse and termination your policy will lapse also referred to in your policy as default if your net account value is not enough to pay your policys monthly charges when due unless o you have paid sufficient premiums to maintain the five year nolapse guarantee against termination and your policy is still within the period of the guarantee and you do not have an outstanding loan

a notice to you at your last known address if your policy lapses you will have a day grace period to pay at least an amount prescribed in your policy which would be enough to keep your policy in force

may owe taxes if your policy terminates while you have a loan outstanding even though you receive no additional money from your policy at that time see tax information later in this prospectus restoring a terminated policy to have your policy restored put back in force you must apply within six months after the date of termination in some states you may have a longer period of time you must also present evidence of insurability satisfactory to us and pay at least the amount of premium that we require the amount of payment will not be more than an amount sufficient to cover total monthly deductions for  months calculated from the effective date of restoration and the premium charge we will determine the amount of this required payment as if no interest or investment performance were credited to or charged against your policy account your policy contains additional information about the amount of this premium and about the values and terms of the policy after it is restored you can guarantee that your policy will not terminate before a certain date you can generally guarantee that your policy will not terminate for five years by paying at least certain specified amounts of premium we call these amounts guarantee premiums and they will be set forth on page  of your policy your policy calls this guarantee the nolapse guarantee in some states this guarantee may be referred to by a different name we make no extra charge for the nolapse guarantee however in order for this guarantee to be effective you must have satisfied the guarantee premium test discussed below and you must not have any outstanding policy loans  in most states if you pay at least certain prescribed amounts of premiums and have no policy loans your policy will not terminate for five years even if the value in your policy becomes insufficient to pay the monthly charges  guarantee premium test if your policys net account value is not sufficient to pay a monthly deduction that has become due we check to see if the cumulative amount of premiums that you have paid to date at least equals the cumulative guarantee premiums due to date for the five year nolapse guarantee if it does your policy will not lapse provided that you have no policy loans outstanding and provided that the period of the guarantee has not expired when we calculate the cumulative amount of guarantee premiums for the five year nolapse guarantee we compound each amount at a  annual interest rate from the due date through the date of the calculation this interest rate is only for purposes of determining whether you have satisfied the five year nolapse guarantee premium test it does not bear any relation to the returns you will actually earn or any loan interest you will actually pay we use the same calculation for determining the cumulative amount of premiums paid beginning with the date each premium is received the amount of premiums you must pay to maintain the five year nolapse guarantee against termination will be increased by the cumulative amount of any partial withdrawals you have taken from your policy calculated by the same method beginning with the date of withdrawal guarantee premiums the amount of the premiums for the five year nolapse guarantee is set forth in your policy on a monthly basis the guarantee premiums are actuarially determined at policy issuance and depend on the age and other insurance risk characteristics of the insured person as well as the amount of the coverage and additional features you select the guarantee premiums may change if for example the face amount of the policy or a rider changes or a rider is added or eliminated or if there is a change in the insured persons risk characteristics we will send you a new policy page showing any change in your guarantee premiums any change will be prospective only and no change will extend the nolapse guarantee period beyond its original number of years you can elect a paid up death benefit guarantee you may elect to take advantage of our paid up death benefit guarantee at any time after the fourth year of your policy if the insureds attained age is  or less if you elect the paid up death benefit guarantee we may initially reduce your base policys face amount see below thereafter your policy will not lapse and the death benefit will never be less than the base policys face amount so long as the guarantee remains in effect the guarantee will terminate however if i at any time following the election the sum of any outstanding policy loans accrued interest and any restricted amount due to exercise of a living benefits rider exceeds your policys account value or ii you request us to terminate the election in order to elect the paid up death benefit guarantee o you must have death benefit option a in effect see about your life insurance benefit below o you must terminate any riders to your policy that carry additional charges including the incentive term rider o the election must not cause the policy to lose its qualification as life insurance under the internal revenue code or require a current distribution from the policy to avoid such disqualification and o the election must not reduce the face amount see below to less than the minimum face amount for which we would then issue a policy the paid up death benefit guarantee applies only to your base policys face amount and not to the face amount or other coverage under any riders that as noted above must be terminated when the guarantee is elected possible reduction of face amount the face amount of your policy after this guarantee is elected is the lesser of a the face amount immediately before the election or b the policy account value divided by a factor based on the then age of the insured person the factors riskbenefit summary policy features benefits and risks  paposth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th are set forth in your policy as a general matter the factors change as the insured person ages so that if your account value stayed the same the result of the calculation under clause b above would be lower the longer your policy is in force if electing the paid up death benefit guarantee causes a reduction in face amount we will deduct the same portion of any remaining surrender charge as we would have deducted if you had requested that decrease directly rather than electing the paid up death benefit guarantee see charges and expenses you will pay earlier in this prospectus other effects of this guarantee you generally may continue to pay premiums after you have elected the paid up death benefit guarantee subject to the same limits as before but premium payments are not required if the election causes your face amount to decrease however the amount of additional premiums you can pay if any may be reduced you may continue to make transfers but you may not change the death benefit option or add riders that have their own charges while the paid up death benefit guarantee is in effect partial withdrawals while the paid up death benefit guarantee is in effect will generally be subject to the same terms and conditions as any other partial withdrawal see making withdrawals from your policy later in this prospectus except that o we may decline your request for a partial withdrawal or any other policy change under the circumstances described in the paid up death benefit guarantee policy endorsement if this occurs you may wish to consider asking us to terminate the paid up death benefit guarantee o partial withdrawals and any distributions we may be required to make for tax purposes will generally reduce your policys face amount by more than the amount of the withdrawal election of the paid up death benefit guarantee may cause your policy to become a modified endowment contract under certain circumstances see tax treatment of distributions to you under tax information later in this prospectus you should consult your tax advisor before making this election

b  the face amount plus the policys account value on the date of death under this option the amount of death benefit generally changes from day to day because many factors including investment performance charges premium payments and withdrawals affect your policys account value your policys account value is the total amount that at any time is earning interest for you or being credited with investment gains and losses under your policy account value is discussed in more detail under determining your policys value later in this prospectus under option b your policys death benefit will tend to be higher than under option a as a result the monthly insurance charge we deduct will also be higher to compensate us for our additional risk alternative higher death benefit in limited

incentive term rider the incentive term rider allows you to purchase additional coverage on the insured person when you purchase your base policy the minimum face amount that you may purchase under

under this rider in lieu of coverage under your base paramount lifesm policy can reduce your current total charges our cost of insurance charges under the incentive term rider are generally currently lower than they are for coverage under the base policy on the other hand the guaranteed maximum charges for the incentive term rider are generally higher in addition this coverage does not have surrender charges and the per  of face amount administrative charge does not apply to coverage under this rider we reserve the right to raise the insurance rates for this rider at any time so that they could exceed the rates for the base policy if your policy is issued with an incentive term rider the five year no lapse guarantee on the target amount is available however the paid up death benefit guarantee is only available with respect to the base coverage in addition any coverage you purchase under the incentive term rider will terminate when the insured reaches age  coverage under the base policy will continue as long as the insured is alive and the policy is in force except as noted in the next sentence if you request a face amount decrease or a partial withdrawal that results in a face amount decrease we will adjust your base policy face amount and your incentive term rider face amount proportionately so that the ratio between the two remains the same however to the extent that such a reduction of the base policy face amount would cause the face amount to fall below the minimum we are then requiring for new policies we will make such reduction from the incentive term rider face amount only any change in the death benefit option will not change the incentive term riders face amount unless the alternative death benefit is in effect if it is any change in your death benefit option will cause your incentive term riders face amount to be automatically reduced as discussed below under change of death benefit option when the alternative death benefit becomes applicable the death benefit under the base policy is increased and the death benefit under the incentive term rider is automatically reduced by the same amount but not below zero use of the incentive term rider instead of an equal amount of coverage under the base policy generally reduces commissions therefore an agent may receive a higher commission for selling you a policy that does not include the incentive term rider see also tax information later in this prospectus for certain possible tax consequences of face amount changes or adding or deleting riders  you can request a change in your death benefit option any time after the second year and before the policy anniversary nearest to the insureds th birthday however changes to option b are not permitted after the insured person reaches

conditions also apply you may not reduce the face amount below the minimum we are then requiring for new policies nor will we permit a decrease that would cause your policy to fail the internal revenue codes definition of life insurance guarantee premiums as well as our monthly deductions for the cost of insurance coverage will generally decrease from the time you reduce the face amount if you reduce the face amount during the first  years of your policy we will deduct all or part of the remaining surrender charge from your policy assuming you have not previously changed the face amount the amount of surrender charge we will deduct will be determined by dividing the amount of the decrease by the initial face amount and multiplying that fraction by the total amount of surrender charge that still remains applicable to your policy we deduct the charge from the same investment options as if it were a part of a regular monthly deduction under your policy in some cases we may have to make a distribution to you from your policy at the time we decrease your policys face amount this may be necessary in order to preserve your policys status as life insurance under the internal revenue code we may also be required to make such a distribution to you in the future on account of a prior decrease in face amount this could have adverse tax consequences risks of investing in a policy the policy is unsuitable as a shortterm savings vehicle some of the principal risks of investing in a policy are as follows o if the investment options you choose perform poorly you could lose some or all of the premiums you pay o if the investment options you choose do not make enough money to pay for the policy charges you could have to pay more premiums to keep your policy from terminating o we can increase without your consent any charge that you currently pay at less than the maximum amount noted in the table below to the maximum shown o you may have to pay a surrender charge and there may be

account fp immediately reinvests all dividends and other distributions it receives from a portfolio in additional shares of that class in that portfolio these trusts sell their shares to equitable life separate accounts in connection with equitable lifes variable life insurance andor annuity products and to separate accounts of insurance companies both affiliated and unaffiliated with equitable life eq advisors trust and axa vip premier trust also sell their shares to the trustee of a qualified plan for equitable life we currently do not foresee any disadvantages to our policyowners arising out of these arrangements however the board of trustees or directors of each trust intends to monitor events to identify any material irreconcilable conflicts that may arise and to determine what

over the internet if you are the owner of the policy you may do this by visiting our web site and enrolling in eqaccess this service may not always be available generally the above described restrictions relating to telephone transfers also apply to eqaccess transfers our dollar cost averaging service we offer a dollar cost averaging service this service allows you to gradually allocate amounts to the variable investment options by periodically transferring approximately the same dollar amount to the variable investment options you select this will cause you to purchase more units if the units value is low and fewer units if the units value is high therefore you may achieve a lower average cost per unit over the long term  using the dollar cost averaging service does not guarantee

restricted basis following your receipt of a living benefits payment as well as by any other loans and accrued loan interest you have outstanding see your option to receive a living benefit below  you can use policy loans to obtain funds from your policy without surrender charges or in most cases paying current income taxes however the borrowed amount is no longer credited with the investment results of any of our investment options under the policy  when you take a policy loan we remove an amount equal to the loan from one or more of your investment options and hold it as collateral for the loans repayment we hold this loan collateral under the same terms and conditions as apply to amounts supporting our guaranteed interest option with several exceptions o you cannot make transfers or withdrawals of the collateral o we expect to credit different rates of interest to loan collateral than we credit under our guaranteed interest option o we do not count the collateral when we compute our customer loyalty credit and o the collateral is not available to pay policy charges when you request your loan you should tell us how much of the loan collateral you wish to have taken from any amounts you have in each of our investment options if you do not give us directions or if we are making the loan automatically to cover unpaid loan interest we will take the loan from your investment options in the same proportion as we are then taking monthly deductions for charges if that is not possible we will take the loan from your investment options in proportion to your value in each loan interest we charge the interest we charge on a policy loan accrues daily at an adjustable interest rate we determine the rate at the beginning of each year of your policy and that rate applies to all policy loans that are outstanding at any time during the year the maximum rate is the greater of a  or b the monthly average corporate yield published in moodys corporate bond yield averages for the month that ends two months before the interest rate is set if that average is no longer published we will use another average as the policy provides we will notify you of the current loan interest rate when you apply for a loan and will notify you in advance of any rate increase loan interest payments are due on each policy anniversary if not paid when due we automatically add the interest as a new policy loan interest that we credit on loan collateral under our current rules the annual interest rate we credit on your loan collateral during any of your policys first fifteen years will be  less than the rate we are then charging you for policy loan interest and beginning in the policys th year equal to the loan interest rate the elimination of the rate differential is not guaranteed however accordingly we have discretion to increase the rate differential for any period including under policies that are already in force and may have outstanding loans we do guarantee that the annual rate of interest credited on your loan collateral will never be less than  and that the differential will not exceed  except if tax law changes increase the taxes we pay on policy loans or loan interest because we first offered paramount lifesm policies in  the interest rate differential has not yet been eliminated under any inforce policies we credit interest on your loan collateral daily on each anniversary of your policy or when your policy loans are fully repaid we transfer that interest to your policys investment options in the same proportions as if it were a premium payment effects of policy loans a loan can reduce the length of time that your insurance remains in force because the amount we set aside as loan collateral cannot be used to pay charges as they become due a loan can also cause any paid up guaranteed death benefit to terminate or the five year nolapse guarantee to become unavailable we will deduct any outstanding policy loan plus accrued loan interest from your policys proceeds if you do not pay it back even if a loan is not taxable when made it may later become taxable for example upon termination or surrender see tax information below for a discussion of the tax consequences of policy loans paying off your loan you can repay all or part of your loan at any time we normally assume that payments you send us are premium payments therefore you must submit instructions with your payment indicating that it is a loan repayment if you send us more than all of the loan principal and interest you owe we will treat the excess as a premium payment when you send us a loan repayment we will transfer an amount equal to such repayment from your loan collateral back to the investment options under your policy first we will restore any amounts that before being designated as loan collateral had been in the guaranteed interest option under your policy we will allocate any additional repayments among investment options as you instruct or if you dont instruct us in the same proportion as if they were premium payments making withdrawals from your policy you may make a partial withdrawal of your net cash surrender value defined below at any time after the first year of your policy and before the policy anniversary nearest to the insureds th birthday the request must be for at least  however and we have discretion to

reduction in the option a death benefit if the paid up death benefit guarantee is in effect a partial withdrawal will generally reduce the face amount by more than the amount of the withdrawal face amount reductions that occur automatically as a result of withdrawals however do not result in our deducting any portion of any then remaining surrender charge we will not permit a partial withdrawal that would reduce the face amount below our minimum for new policy issuances at the time or that would cause the policy to no longer be treated as life insurance for federal income tax purposes if death benefit option b is in effect a partial withdrawal reduces the death benefit on a dollar for dollar basis but does not affect the face amount the result is different however during any time when the alternative death benefit discussed earlier in this prospectus would be higher than the option a or b death benefit you have selected in that case a partial withdrawal will cause the death benefit to decrease by more than the amount of the withdrawal even if the paid up death benefit guarantee is not then in effect a partial withdrawal reduces the amount of your premium payments that counts toward maintaining your policys nolapse guarantee as well a partial withdrawal may increase the chance that your policy could lapse because of insufficient value to pay policy charges as they fall due or it could result in the five year nolapse guarantee not being in effect you should refer to tax information below for information about possible tax consequences of partial withdrawals and any associated reduction in policy benefits surrendering your policy for its net cash surrender value you can surrender give us back your policy for its net cash surrender value at any time the net cash surrender value equals your account value minus any outstanding loans and unpaid loan interest minus any amount of your account value that is restricted as a result of previously distributed living

subject to our insurance underwriting guidelines and availability in your state your policy will automatically include our living benefits rider this feature enables you to receive a portion generally  of the policys death benefit excluding death benefits payable under certain other policy riders if the insured person has a terminal illness as defined in the rider we make no additional charge for the rider however if you tell us that you do not wish to have the living benefits rider added at issue but you later ask to add it we will need to evaluate the insurance risk at that time and we may decline to issue the rider if you receive a living benefit the remaining benefits under your policy will be affected we will deduct the amount of any living benefit we have paid plus interest as specified in the rider from the death benefit proceeds that become payable under the policy if and when the insured person dies in your policy we refer to this as a lien we establish against your policy when we pay a living benefit we automatically transfer a pro rata portion of your policys net cash surrender value to the policys guaranteed interest option this amount together with the interest we charge thereon will be restricted that is it will not be available for any loans transfers or partial withdrawals that you may wish to make in addition it may not be used to satisfy the

interpretations it assumes that the policyowner is a natural person who is a us citizen and resident the tax effects on corporate taxpayers nonus residents or nonus citizens may be different this discussion is general in nature and should not be considered tax advice for which you should consult a qualified tax advisor basic tax treatment for you and your beneficiary a paramount lifesm policy will be treated as life insurance for federal income tax purposes a if it meets the definition of life insurance under section  of the internal revenue code the code and b as long as the investments made by the underlying portfolios satisfy certain investment diversification requirements under section h of the code we believe that the policies will meet these requirements and therefore that o the death benefit received by the beneficiary under your policy generally will not be subject to federal income tax and o increases in your policys account value as a result of interest or investment experience will not be subject to federal income tax unless and until there is a distribution from your policy such as a surrender a partial withdrawal loan or a payment to you there may be different tax consequences if you assign your policy or designate a new owner see assigning your policy later in this prospectus tax treatment of distributions to you the federal income tax consequences of a distribution from your policy depend on whether your policy is a modified endowment contract sometimes also referred to as an mec in all cases however the character of any income described below as being taxable to the recipient will be ordinary income as opposed to capital gain testing for modified endowment contract status your policy will be a modified endowment contract if at any time during the first seven years of your policy you have paid a cumulative amount of premiums that exceeds the cumulative sevenpay limit the cumulative sevenpay limit is the amount of premiums that you would have paid by that time under a similar fixedbenefit insurance policy that was designed based on certain assumptions mandated under the code to provide for paid up future benefits after the payment of seven equal annual premiums paid up means that no future premiums would be required this is called the sevenpay test whenever there is a material change under a policy the policy will generally be a treated as a new contract for purposes of determining whether the policy is a modified endowment contract and b subjected to a new sevenpay period and a new sevenpay limit the new sevenpay limit would be determined taking into account under a prescribed formula the account value of the policy at the time of such change a materially changed policy would be considered a modified endowment contract if it failed to satisfy the new sevenpay limit at any time during the new sevenpay period a material change for these purposes could occur as a result of a change in death benefit option the selection of additional rider benefits or certain other changes if your policys benefits are reduced during its first seven years or within seven years after a material change the sevenpay limit will be redetermined based on the reduced level of benefits and applied retroactively for purposes of the sevenpay test such a reduction in benefits could include for example a requested decrease in face amount the termination of additional benefits under a rider or in some cases a partial withdrawal if the premiums previously paid are greater than the recalculated lower sevenpay limit the policy will become a modified endowment contract a life insurance policy that you receive in exchange for a modified endowment contract will also be considered a modified endowment contract in addition to the above premium limits for testing for modified endowment status there are overall limits on the amount of premiums you may pay under your policy in order for it to qualify as life insurance changes made to your policy for example a decrease in face amount including any decrease that may occur as a result of a partial withdrawal or other decrease in benefits may impact the maximum amount of premiums that can be paid as well as the maximum amount of account value that may be maintained under the policy in some cases this may cause us to take current or future action in order to assure that your policy continues to qualify as life insurance including distribution of amounts to you that may be includible as income see changes we can make later in this prospectus taxation of predeath distributions if your policy is not a modified endowment contract as long as your policy remains in force as a nonmodified endowment contract policy loans will be treated as indebtedness and no part of the loan proceeds will be subject to current federal income tax interest on the loan will generally not be tax deductible although interest credited on loan collateral may become taxable under the rules below if distributed if you make a partial withdrawal after the first  years of your policy the proceeds will not be subject to federal income tax except to the extent such proceeds exceed your basis in your policy your basis generally will equal the premiums you have paid less the amount of any previous distributions from your policy that were not taxable during the first  years however the proceeds from a partial withdrawal could be subject to federal income tax under a complex formula to the extent that your account value exceeds your basis upon full surrender any amount by which the

distribution from your policy all or part of which may be taxable taxation of predeath distributions if your policy is a modified endowment contract any distribution from your policy will be taxed on an incomefirst basis if your policy is a modified endowment contract distributions for this purpose include a loan including any increase in the loan amount to pay interest on an existing loan or an assignment or a pledge to secure a loan or withdrawal any such distributions will be considered taxable income to you to the extent your account value exceeds your basis in the policy for modified endowment contracts your basis is similar to the basis described above for other policies except that it also would be increased by the amount of any prior loan under your policy that was considered taxable income to you for purposes of determining the taxable portion of any distribution all modified endowment contracts issued by equitable life or its affiliate to the same owner excluding certain qualified plans during any calendar year are treated as if they were a single contract a  penalty tax also will apply to the taxable portion of most distributions from a policy that is a modified endowment contract the penalty tax will not however apply to i taxpayers whose actual age is at least   ii distributions in the case of a disability as defined in the code or iii distributions received as part of a series of substantially equal periodic annuity payments for the life or life expectancy of the taxpayer or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the taxpayer and his or her beneficiary if your policy terminates after a grace period the extinguishment of any then outstanding policy loan and unpaid loan interest will be treated as a distribution to the extent the loan was not previously treated as such and could be subject to tax including the  penalty tax as described above in addition upon a full surrender any excess of the proceeds we pay including any amounts we use to discharge any loan over your basis in the policy will be subject to federal income tax and unless an exception applies the  penalty tax distributions that occur during a year of your policy in which it becomes a modified endowment contract and during any subsequent years will be taxed as described in the four preceding paragraphs in addition distributions from a policy within two years before it becomes a modified endowment contract also will be subject to tax in this manner this means that a distribution made from a policy that is not a modified endowment contract could later become taxable as a distribution from a modified endowment contract restoration of a terminated policy for tax purposes some restorations of a policy that terminated after a grace period may be treated as the purchase of a new policy tax treatment of living benefits proceeds amounts received under an insurance policy on the life of an individual who is terminally ill as defined by the tax law are generally excludable from the payees gross income we believe that the benefits provided under our living benefits rider meet the tax laws definition of terminally ill and can qualify for this income tax exclusion this exclusion does not apply to amounts paid to someone other than the insured person however if the payee has an insurable interest in the insured persons life only because the insured person is a director officer or employee of the payee or by reason of the insured person being financially interested in any trade or business carried on by the payee effect of policy on interest deductions taken by business entities ownership of a policy by a trade or business entity can limit the amount of any interest on business borrowings that entity otherwise could deduct for federal income tax purposes even though such business borrowings may be unrelated to the policy to avoid the limit the insured person must be an officer director employee or  owner of the trade or business entity when coverage on that person commences the limit does not generally apply for policies owned by natural persons even if those persons are conducting a trade or business as sole proprietorships unless a trade or business entity that is not a sole proprietorship is a direct or indirect beneficiary under the policy entities commonly have such a beneficial interest for example in socalled split dollar arrangements if the trade or business entity has such an interest in a policy it will be treated the same as if it owned the policy for purposes of the limit on deducting interest on unrelated business income the limit generally applies only to policies issued after june   in taxable years ending after such date however for this purpose any material increase in face amount or other material change in a policy will be treated as the issuance of a new policy in cases where the abovediscussed limit on deductibility applies the nondeductible portion of unrelated interest on business loans is determined by multiplying the total amount of such interest by a fraction the numerator of the fraction is the policys average account value excluding amounts we are

neither the insured person nor the beneficiary the owner will be considered to have made a gift to the beneficiary of the death benefit proceeds when they become payable in general a person will not owe estate or gift taxes until gifts made by such person plus that persons taxable estate total at least  million for estate tax purposes only this amount is scheduled to rise at periodic intervals to  million in  for year  the estate tax is scheduled to be repealed for years  and thereafter the estate tax is reinstated and the gift and estate tax exemption referred to above would again be  million

less per year for each recipient as a general rule if you make a transfer to a person two or more generations younger than you a generationskipping tax may be payable generationskipping transactions would include for example a case where a grandparent skips his or her children and names his or her grandchildren as a policys beneficiaries in that case the generationskipping transfer would be deemed to occur when the insurance proceeds are paid the generationskipping tax rates are similar to the maximum estate tax rate in effect at the time individuals however are generally allowed an aggregate generationskipping tax exemption of  million indexed annually for inflation eg  for  beginning in year  this exemption will be the same as the amounts discussed above for estate taxes including a full repeal in year  then return to current law in years  and thereafter beginning in  at any time during which there is no federal estate tax in effect we will waive any surrender charges that would otherwise apply the particular situation of each policyowner insured person or beneficiary will determine how ownership or receipt of policy proceeds will be treated for purposes of federal estate gift and generationskipping taxes as well as state and local estate inheritance and other taxes because these rules are complex you should consult with a qualified tax adviser for specific information especially where benefits are passing to younger generations if this policy is being purchased pursuant to a splitdollar arrangement you should also consult your tax advisor for advice concerning the effect of irs notice  and recent proposed regulations regarding splitdollar arrangements on your splitdollar arrangement the transition and grandfathering rules among other items should be carefully reviewed pension and profitsharing plans there are special limits on the amount of insurance that may be purchased by a trust or other entity that forms part of a pension or profitsharing plan qualified under section a or  of the code in addition the federal income tax consequences will be different from those described in this prospectus these rules are complex and you should consult a qualified tax advisor other employee benefit programs complex rules may also apply when a policy is held by an employer or a trust or acquired by an employee in connection with the provision of other employee benefits employees may have imputed income for the value of any economic benefit provided by the employer there may be other tax implications as well among other issues these policyowners must consider whether the policy was applied for by or issued to a person having an insurable interest under applicable state law and with the insured persons consent the lack of an insurable interest or consent may among other things affect the qualification of the policy as life insurance for federal income tax purposes and the right of the beneficiary to receive a death benefit in early  the irs issued a notice and opening of a regulations project concerning the taxation of splitdollar life insurance arrangements proposed regulations have been issued which provide new proposed and interim guidance on such arrangements transition and grandfathering rules among other items should be carefully reviewed when considering such arrangements in addition public corporations generally publicly traded or publicly reporting companies and their subsidiaries should consider the possible implications on splitdollar arrangements of recent amendments to the securities exchange act of  which generally prohibit certain direct or indirect loans to executive officers or directors at least some split dollar arrangements could be deemed to involve loans within

we are required to withhold income tax from any proceeds we distribute as part of a taxable transaction under your policy if you do not wish us to withhold tax from the payment or if we do not withhold enough you may have to pay later and you may incur penalties under the estimated income tax rules in some cases where generation skipping taxes may apply we may also be required to withhold for such taxes unless we are provided satisfactory notification that no such taxes are due states may also require us to withhold tax on distributions to you special withholding rules apply if you are not a us resident or not a us citizen possibility of future tax changes and other tax information the us congress frequently considers legislation that if enacted could change the tax treatment of life insurance policies or increase the taxes we pay in connection with such policies in addition the treasury department may amend existing regulations issue regulations on the qualification of life insurance and modified endowment contracts or adopt new or clarifying interpretations of existing law state and local tax law or if you are not a us citizen and resident foreign tax law may also affect the tax consequences to you the insured person or your beneficiary and are subject to change or change in interpretation any changes in federal state local or foreign tax law or interpretations could have a retroactive effect both on our taxes and on the way your policy is taxed you may make transfers among portfolios of the separate account but you may not direct the investments each portfolio makes if the irs were to conclude that you as the investor have control over these investments then the policy would no longer qualify as life insurance you would be treated as the owner of separate account assets and be currently taxed on any taxable income or gain the assets generate the irs has provided some guidance on this question of investor control but many issues remain unclear one such issue is whether a policyowner can have too much investor control if the variable life policy offers a large number of investment options in which to invest account values andor the ability to make frequent transfers under the policy although the treasury department announced several years ago that it would provide formal guidance on this issue it had not done so as of the date of this prospectus we do not know if the irs will provide any further guidance on the issue if guidance is provided we do not know if it would apply retroactively to policies already in force we believe that our variable life policies do not give policyowners investment control over the investments underlying the various investment options however the irs could disagree with our position the irs could seek to treat policyowners with a large number of investment options andor the ability to freely transfer among investment options as the owners of the underlying portfolios shares accordingly we

policy charges the charges under the policies are designed to cover in the aggregate our direct and indirect costs of selling administering and providing benefits under the policies they are also designed in the aggregate to compensate us for the risks of loss we assume pursuant to the policies if as we expect the charges that we collect from the policies exceed our total costs in connection with the policies we will earn a profit otherwise we will incur a loss the current and maximum rates of certain of our charges have been set with reference to estimates of the amount of specific types of expenses or risks that we will incur in most cases this prospectus identifies such expenses or risks in the name of the charge eg the administrative charge cost of insurance charge and mortality and expense risk charge however the fact that any charge bears the name of or is designed primarily to defray a particular expense or risk does not mean that the amount we collect from that charge will never be more than the amount of such expense or risk nor does it mean that we may not also be compensated for such expense or risk out of any other charges we are permitted to deduct by the terms of the policies the surrender charge for example is designed primarily to defray sales expenses but may also be used to defray other expenses associated with your policy that we have not recovered by the time of any surrender similarly the premium charge is designed primarily to defray sales and tax expenses we incur that are based on premium payments monthly cost of insurance charge the monthly cost of insurance charge is determined by multiplying the cost of insurance rate that is then applicable to your policy by the amount we have at risk under your policy our amount at risk also described in your policy as net amount at risk on any date is the difference between a the death benefit that would be payable if the insured person died on that date and b the then total account value under the policy a greater amount at risk or a higher cost of insurance rate will result in a higher monthly charge generally the cost of insurance rate increases from one policy year to the next this happens automatically because of the insured persons increasing age our cost of insurance rates are guaranteed not to exceed those that will be specified in your policy for most insured persons at most ages our current rates are lower than those maximums therefore we have the ability to raise these rates up to the guaranteed maximum at any time the guaranteed maximum cost of insurance rates for gender neutral paramount lifesm policies for insureds who are under age  are based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality table b for all other policies for insureds who are age  or above the guaranteed maximum cost of insurance rates are based on the  commissioners standard ordinary male and female smoker and nonsmoker mortality tables for insureds who are under  the guaranteed maximum cost of insurance rates are based on the  commissioners standard ordinary male and female mortality tables our cost of insurance rates will generally be lower except for gender neutral policies and in connection with certain employee benefit plans if the insured person is a female than if a male they also will generally be lower for nontobacco users than tobacco users and lower for persons that have other highly favorable health characteristics as compared to those that do not on the other hand insured persons who present particular health occupational or avocational risks may be charged higher cost of insurance rates and other additional charges as specified in their policies in addition the current rates also vary depending on the duration of the policy ie the length of time since the policy was issued we offer lower rates for nontobacco users only if they are at least age  you may ask us to review a younger insured persons tobacco habits beginning on the policy anniversary on which such person is age  any insured person of attained age  or over being charged tobacco user rates may apply for nontobacco user rates the change if approved may result in lower future cost of insurance rates beginning on the effective date of the change to nontobacco user rates the change will be based upon our general underwriting rules in effect at the time of application and may include criteria other than tobacco use status as well as a definition of tobacco use different from that applicable at the time this policy was issued the change to nontobacco

personalized illustrations illustrations are intended to show how different fees charges and rates of return can affect the values available under a policy illustrations are based upon characteristics of a hypothetical insured person as well as other assumed factors this type of illustration is called a hypothetical illustration illustrations can also be based upon some of the characteristics of the insured person under your policy as well as some other policy feature choices you make such as the face amount death benefit option premium payment amounts and assumed rates of return within limits this type of illustration is called a personalized illustration no illustration will ever show you the actual values available under your policy at any given point in time this is because many factors affect these values including i the insured persons characteristics ii policy features you choose iii actual premium payments you make iv loans or withdrawals you make and v actual rates of return including the actual fees and expenses of the underlying portfolios in which your cash value is invested each hypothetical or personalized illustration is accompanied by an explanation of the assumptions on which that illustration is based because as discussed below these assumptions may differ considerably you should carefully review all of the disclosure that accompanies each illustration different kinds of illustrations both hypothetical and personalized illustrations can reflect the investment management fees and expenses incurred in  or expected to be incurred in  if such amount is expected to be higher of the available underlying portfolios in different ways an arithmetic illustration uses the straight average of all of the available underlying portfolios investment management fees and expenses a weighted illustration computes the average of investment management fees and expenses based upon an assumed percentage allocation of premium payments among the available underlying portfolios currently this type of illustration is limited to a combination of up to five of the available underlying portfolios a fund specific illustration uses only the investment management fees and expenses of a specific underlying portfolio an arithmeticweighted illustration uses the straight average of all of the available underlying portfolios investment management fees and a weighted average based upon the aggregate assets in each portfolio at the end of  of the expenses of all of the available portfolios a historical illustration reflects the actual performance of one of the available underlying portfolios during a stated period when reviewing a weighted fund specific or arithmeticweighted illustration you should keep in mind that the values shown may be higher than the values shown in other illustrations because the fees and expenses that are assumed may be lower than those assumed in other illustrations when reviewing a historical illustration you should keep in mind that values based upon past performance are no indication of what the values will be based on future performance the effect of the expense limitation arrangements the investment management fees and expenses used in all of the illustrations reflect the expense limitation arrangements that are in effect with respect to certain of the portfolios see the fee table under riskbenefit summary charges and expenses you will pay earlier in this prospectus if these fees and expenses were not reduced to reflect the expense limitation arrangements in effect the values in the illustrations would be lower you can request an arithmetic illustration as well any of the other illustrations described above appendix iii to the prospectus contains an arithmetic hypothetical

and the portfolios with o those of other insurance company separate accounts or mutual funds included in the rankings prepared by lipper analytical services inc morningstar inc or similar investment services that monitor the performance of insurance company separate accounts or mutual funds o other appropriate indices of investment securities the consumer price index and averages for peer universes of mutual funds o data developed by us derived from such indices or averages or o other appropriate types of securities eg common stocks longterm government bonds longterm corporate bonds intermediate term government bonds and us treasury bills we also may furnish to present or prospective policyowners advertisements or other communications that include evaluations of a variable

peer universes of portfolios with similar investment objectives in its lipper variable insurance products performance analysis service lipper survey morningstar inc compiles similar data in the morningstar variable annuitylife report morningstar report the lipper survey records performance data as reported to it by over  mutual funds underlying variable annuity and life insurance products it divides these actively managed portfolios into  categories by portfolio objectives the lipper survey contains two different universes which reflect different types of fees in performance data o the separate account universe reports performance data net of investment management fees direct operating expenses and assetbased charges applicable under variable insurance and annuity contracts and o the mutual fund universe reports performance net only of investment management fees and direct operating expenses and therefore reflects only charges that relate to the underlying mutual fund the morningstar report consists of nearly  variable life and annuity portfolios all of which report their data net of investment management fees direct operating expenses and separate account level charges longterm market trends historically the investment performance of common stocks over the long term has generally been superior to that of long or shortterm debt securities however common stocks have also experienced dramatic changes in value over short periods of time one of our variable investment options that invests primarily in common stocks may therefore be a desirable selection for owners who are willing to accept such risks if on the other hand you wish to limit your shortterm risk you may find it preferable to allocate a smaller percentage of net premiums to those options that invest primarily in common stock all investments in securities whether equity or debt involve varying degrees of risk they also offer varying degrees of potential reward appendix i information on

benefits account values net cash surrender values and accumulated premiums the following tables illustrate the changes in death benefit account value and net cash surrender value of the policy under certain hypothetical circumstances that we assume solely for this purpose each table illustrates the operation of a policy for a specified issue age premium payment schedule and face amount under death benefit option a and death benefit option b the amounts shown are for the end of each policy year and assume that all of the account value is invested in portfolios that achieve investment returns at constant gross annual rates of   and  ie before any investment management fees or other expenses are deducted from the underlying portfolio assets after the deduction of the arithmetic average of the investment management fees and other expenses of all of the underlying portfolios as described below the corresponding net annual rates of return would be      and   these net annual rates of return do not reflect the mortality and expense risk charge or the other charges we deduct from your policys value each month if the net annual rates of return did reflect these charges the rates shown would be lower however the values shown in the following tables also reflect all policy charges investment return reflects investment income and all realized and unrealized capital gains and losses the tables assume annual planned periodic premiums that are paid at the beginning of each policy year for an insured person who is a  year old preferred risk male nontobacco user when the policy is issued tables are provided for each of the two death benefit options the tables headed current charges assume that the current rates for all charges deducted by equitable life will apply in each year illustrated the tables headed maximum charges are the same except that the maximum permitted rates for all years are used for all charges the tables do not reflect any charge that we reserve the right to make but are not currently making the tables assume that i no optional rider benefits have been elected ii no loans or withdrawals are made iii no decreases in coverage are requested and iv no change in the death benefit option is requested with respect to fees and expenses deducted from assets of the underlying portfolios the amounts shown in all tables reflect  investment management fees equivalent to an effective annual rate of   and  an assumed average asset charge for all other expenses of the underlying portfolios equivalent to an effective annual rate of   these rates are the arithmetic average for all portfolios that are available as investment options in other words they are based on the hypothetical assumption that policy account values are allocated equally among the variable investment options the actual rates associated with any policy will vary depending upon the actual allocation of policy values among the investment options these rates do not reflect expense limitation arrangements in effect with respect to certain of the underlying portfolios if those arrangements had been assumed to continue for all years illustrated the policy values would be higher than those shown in the following tables the second column of each table shows the amount you would have at the end of each policy year if an amount equal to the assumed planned periodic premiums were invested to earn interest after taxes at  annually this is not a policy value it is included for comparison purposes only because your circumstances will no doubt differ from those in
