quarter and full year fiscal  fiscal results reflecting on fiscal  it was an incredible year we continued to deliver new innovations across our platform at what we believe is an industryleading rate in addition we saw major traction with our enterprise customers around the globe and are the clear leader for our cloudbased digital intelligence our strong performance included fullyear revenue growth of  and a  percentage point improvement in our nongaap operating margin both well ahead of our goals entering the year we exited the year with great momentum im going to jump right into some of the highlights during the fourth quarter we closed a record number of both six and seven figure deals including the largest in new relics history an upsell to an existing customer resulting in a three year  million total contract value relationship we also achieved many other records including our first million dollar arr customer for new relic insights alone and several sizable wins for new relic infrastructure these both combined to our highest ever percentage of new business coming outside of our core apm product our enterprise business delivered a fantastic performance for the quarter and the year spanning geographies as well as industry verticals for instance our new million dollar customers this quarter came from the us uk canada israel and south asia reinforcing our view that new relic is increasingly being seen globally as a strategic partner for advancing the success of key digital initiatives overall we ended the year with more than  seven figure arr customers up nearly  from last year and more than  six figure arr customers up from over  a year ago in businesses across the globe we are seeing the pace of new software development and transformative digital initiatives continue with ferocity acting as a key tailwind for our growth we see this happening as enterprises accelerate their efforts to move away from legacy onpremise infrastructure and adopt cloudbased platforms companies are increasingly understanding that their cloud strategy needs to include much deeper visibility into performance of these missioncritical applications which ultimately drive their topline results these dynamics continue to drive my enthusiasm for new relics future we are targeting another strong growth performance in fiscal  supporting our longerterm goal of  billion revenue run rate by the end of fiscal  like ive done in past calls let me take a moment to review how we performed against our key annual objectives before talking about our goals for fiscal  first we believe that new relic is quickly becoming the enterprise standard for digital intelligence second our goal of ubiquity in the market is continuing to be more evident and third we continue to put innovation at the forefront of everything we do as i just outlined our enterprise momentum is very strong in fact we believe our enterprise business continues to grow faster than any of our direct competitors digital transformation is a critical strategic priority for enterprises who in order to drive topline growth need to deliver new digital experiences for their customers these initiatives are being watched at the boardroom level this means that it teams need deep visibility into the performance of their applications and underlying infrastructure and new relic is dedicated to helping our customers see their digital businesses more clearly we see synergies between new relics digital intelligence platform which was built and born in the cloud and these enterprise initiatives as uniquely aligned enterprises increasingly understand that traditional monitoring solutions were never designed to monitor measure and analyze their future digital business initiatives as a result we think enterprises have to invest in the nextgeneration cloudbased digital intelligence platform as they look to deliver new innovative solutions and improve the existing services they offer customers as it relates to our second goal we believe our success throughout fiscal  underscores the strategic importance of our focus on ubiquity and driving adoption across multiple roles in our customers organizations an example of how ubiquity drives larger more strategic deals can be seen by the record deal i spoke of earlier this record enterprise deal was with a diversified fortune  company already using new relic across dozens of business units and which has engaged us in  transactions over the past six years our presence here is both broad and deep and their continued commitment would not have been possible without the support of their nearly  users who rely on new relic each month working together we determined that our presence and their need align in a way where we could demonstrate that there was additional value to be had by forging a more strategic partnership equally important it was a deal that made sense for both of us this organization is embracing the cloud with around  developers it ops personnel and business leaders working together using new relic to drive the success of their digital business initiatives in fact this company is using our platform in  countries even more notable while this deal included our full platform there is still meaningful potential for them to broaden their usage and we expect them or one of our other enterprise customers to become our first  million arr relationship in the not too distant future while ubiquity is clearly important for driving our enterprise strategy it remains an imperative across the overall business as breadth of adoption can help stimulate more strategic dialogues in all segments in fact during the quarter we had our first midmarket customer cross through the million dollar arr threshold an international company using five of our products overall during the fourth quarter we had impressive wins in verticals like retail with babycenter buffalo wild wings room and board and under armour we also saw great wins in financial services vertical with allianz and barclays as well as technology with adobe citrix and linkedin as companies are launching digital businesses or adopting the public cloud as a core component of their digital transformation initiatives they are more and more often turning to new relic the third key focus area for us in fiscal  was continuing to extend our innovation advantage i want to tip my hat to the entire product organization for a breakthrough year in what we delivered to our customers this included releasing new products like new relic infrastructure and significant platform advancements around learning dashboards crash reporting and support for both singlepage applications and the go programming language finally we launched customerfriendly improvements like cloud pricing and availability in the amazon web services marketplace as we look ahead to fiscal  one particular area of excitement is project seymour seymour leverages unique machine learning algorithms to surface targeted and actionable information to users depending on their role and interests were getting great feedback in limited beta and are on track for a release later this year these innovations speak to the breadth and value of our digital intelligence platform and our goal of ultimately delivering over half of our business outside of apm our progress against this goal is supported by our nonapm solutions contributing a record percentage of new business in the quarter over  in fact new relic insights once again represented around  of new business and was highlighted by a record deal with a fortune  company who is now spending  figures just on new relic insights alone they are using insights in part to monitor a highly strategic product launch obtaining visibility into all aspects of the initiatives from the user experience to the business results as part of this deal the company is also leveraging other products across our digital intelligence platform including mobile browser and infrastructure overall we were encouraged by the performance of new relic infrastructure in its first full quarter in the market this awesome new product was included in  of our top  deals and represented just shy of  of new business in the quarter were going to continue to invest aggressively in this offering throughout fiscal  both in terms of product and gotomarket we expect new relic infrastructure to meaningfully add to our addressable market over the coming years as it solves a real problem for our customers who need to monitor their dynamic infrastructure as well as their applications as they continue to move to the cloud customers need to see how their applications are performing and we feel new relic infrastructure delivers the premier solution overall as we look towards fiscal  we expect to continue to deliver on this winning strategy and there is one new goal i want to highlight for you today in fiscal  new relics number one priority is to dominate the cloud its never been more clear to us that to succeed longterm in the digital intelligence market one has to win in the cloud we think we are past the tipping point as underscored by cios at large global banks recently making headlines for pushing cloudfirst initiatives in our view competitors focused on the onpremise segment of our market where the market used to be will ultimately be left behind as the cloud becomes the dominant computing platform in the coming years while weve always enjoyed overwhelming win rates in the cloud we want these to be even more dominant going forward from a product perspective we will be doubling down on developing bestofclass native integrations across our entire platform with all of the major cloud providers let me be clear today we monitor both onpremise and cloudbased workloads for many of our customers and we will continue to monitor both to support our customers but as the cloud market continues to expand our goal for new relic is to be the obvious choice for measuring monitoring and analyzing every cloudbased digital application to support this we will be working closer than ever with our partners and influencers letting them play a key role in being our ambassadors this includes the key cloud providers consultants and ecosystem isvs last quarter we spoke a bit about our new gotomarket motion with amazon web services during the fourth quarter we announced a strategic alliance and new integration with splunk to provide enterprises with a view into both application performance and infrastructure health with seamless sharing of data across splunk and new relic platforms we will continue to look for ways going forward to integrate new relic with other key technologies beyond aws and splunk including other infrastructure services like storage and database as well as key saas services we believe that if we can dominate the cloud we will be extremely well positioned for market leading growth over the longterm before i wrap up i also want to make a few brief comments around the recently announced management changes as we announced last month hilarie koplowmcadams will be retiring in june and ive wanted to truly thank her for her role in transforming our gotomarket organization over the past three plus years she did an amazing job for new relic and helped to put in place the foundation to drive the strong results that we are sharing today personally i will continue to oversee daytoday operations and increase my involvement with our gotomarket organization our chief marketing officer robson grieve and head of technical sales service and support roger scott now report directly to me along with erica schultz who is expanding upon her role running enterprise sales to lead both enterprise and the smb sales organizations jim gochee our chief product officer and kristy friedrichs our chief people officer will continue to report to me along with mark i am confident that this teams experienced enterprise leaders will continue to drive our success in fiscal  in closing we continue to be the cloud leader in the market and make significant progress against our strategic growth initiatives we very much remain on track to achieve our longerterm objectives and ive never been more enthusiastic about new relics future with that ill turn it over to mark mark sachleben thanks lew turning to the financials our fourth quarter revenue was  million up  yearoveryear  sequentially and ahead of our original guidance and preliminary expectations announced in early april overall we ended the quarter with more than  total paid business accounts  of which pay more than  per year our annualized revenue per average paid business account reached approximately  up  yearoveryear and  sequentially as ive done for our past endofyear calls ill provide some additional color today around how we ended the year we ended q with  paid business accounts paying over  per year up over  from a year ago we also finished the year with more than  paid business accounts paying over  million per year more than double last year our enterprise business defined as paid business accounts with more than  employees ended the year at approximately  of annualized recurring revenue up from around  at the end of fiscal year  while we ended with over  enterprise paid business accounts as we expect our enterprise business to reach over half of our arr by the end of fiscal  we have decided to start providing certain metrics that we believe better reflect our enterprise strategy most notably each quarter we will now provide a number of paid business accounts paying over  per year in addition to the percentage of arr coming from enterprise we have provided the historical trends for these metrics as part of our investor presentation on the website going forward we will no longer report the over  per year metric which is much less relevant given our enterprise focus similarly while we will continue to report a total paid business account metric for each quarter we will be rounding down the figure as there has been increasing noise that can appear from quartertoquarter that we believe diminishes the value of a specific figure for instance in q as a result of the large deal that lew referenced we consolidated several dozen smaller accounts into one large enterprisewide account our dollar based net expansion rate in the quarter was  up from  last quarter we continue to expect to see a similar seasonal pattern in fiscal  as we saw this past year turning to our geographic split us revenue of  million for the quarter was up  yearoveryear while nonu s revenue for the quarter grew to  million up  yearoveryear nonus revenue represented  of revenue in the quarter before moving to profit and loss items i would like to point out that unless otherwise specified all of the expense and profitability metrics i will be discussing going forward are nongaap results a full reconciliation between historical gaap and nongaap results can be found in our earnings release issued today and available on our website our gross margin was  up from  in the yearago period and in line with last quarter as we look ahead we expect to sustain bestinclass gross margins around  in fiscal  with regard to operating expenses sales and marketing costs were  million compared to  million last quarter and  million in the same quarter last year last quarter we spoke about accelerating certain gotomarket investments and in fact in q we had our strongest hiring quarter of the year a pace which we expect to continue in q rd expenses were  million compared to  million last quarter and  million in the same quarter last year the sequential increase was largely due to numerous personnel related costs resetting as we enter the new calendar year ga costs were  million compared to  million last quarter and  million in the same quarter last year due to a similar increase in personnel related costs as we entered  as well as the beginning of a major internal systems upgrade which we expect to impact ga expenses through most of fiscal  overall our expense in the quarter produced an operating loss of  million compared to  million last quarter but down meaningfully from  million for the same quarter last year this resulted in a negative operating margin of  in the quarter compared to negative  last quarter and negative  in the same quarter last year or roughly a  point yearoveryear improvement for the second consecutive quarter our net loss per share was  compared to  last quarter and  in the same quarter last year quickly running through our financials for the year revenue was  million up  over last year gross margins were  up from  in fiscal  operating margin was a loss of  versus a loss of  and our net loss per share was  compared to a net loss per share of  in fiscal  turning to our balance sheet we ended the year with approximately  million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments up from approximately  million last quarter elsewhere on the balance sheet our total deferred revenue ended the quarter at  million up  yearoveryear and  quarteroverquarter we still do not view deferred revenue as a reliable indicator of our underlying business trends due to the varying durations of our contracts and billing terms as well as the overall velocity of our land and expand model which in certain instances can result in our renewal base moving around from prior years let me pause here to discuss the impact of several of these on our q results we do not intend to regularly comment on specific factors impacting deferred revenue but given the impacts in q and potential subsequent effects on q we wanted to provide some additional transparency first we saw an approximately  million benefit from a couple of renewals that we previously expected to close in april but closed and were billed as part of the upsells in march additionally we saw a benefit of approximately  million from converting several customers to annual invoicing overall our installed base ended the year with a  month average invoice duration looking ahead to q we expect deferred revenue to be flat from q primarily due to the early renewals and billing activity previously discussed which overall act as about a  million headwind to our q deferred revenue for the remainder of the year we expect deferred revenue to generally follow a similar seasonal pattern that it did throughout fiscal  with the exception of q  which wed expect to show more muted sequential growth versus fiscal  given the unique factors that we benefit from this past q turning to cash flow we generated positive cash from operations for the sixth consecutive quarter a record of nearly  million free cash flow defined as cash from operations minus purchase of capital expenditures minus capitalized software was also positive at roughly  million as we look into fiscal  we expect cash from operations to be between  million and  million and physical capital expenditures to be  million to  million reflecting some delayed spending from fiscal  for the year we also expect capitalized software to be at similar levels to last year overall we expect to generate between  million and  million of free cash flow for fiscal  now i will turn to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal  and the fiscal year as a whole some of which we previously announced in early april we are initiating our outlook as follows for the first fiscal quarter ending june  we expect revenue to range from  million to  million or growth of  to  yearoveryear we expect a nongaap operating loss of  million to  million this will lead to nongaap net loss per share in the range of  to  based upon a weighted average share count of  million for the quarter for the full fiscal year of  we expect revenue to range from  million to  million or growth of  to  yearoveryear we expect a nongaap operating loss of  million to  million this will lead to a nongaap net loss per share in the range of  to  based upon a weighted average share count of  million one very quick modeling note our largest futurestack event is expected to occur in new york in q this year versus q last year which should contribute towards a modestly higher level of sales and marketing spend in q versus q than in prior years where the two quarters have been relatively flat overall we continue to expect to achieve sustainable nongaap operating income by the end of this fiscal year and with that we are happy to turn it over to your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from michael turits from raymond james michael turits hey guys a quick question for you mark theres a lot of puts and takes obviously around the deferred revenue issue i know its one of your favorites but i just wanted to see if some of the bigger picture trends regarding deal sizes renewals et cetera that had contributed to some backend loading to billings in  will be the same types of patterns well see in  mark sachleben thanks michael yes its always a pleasure having the first question be about billings right michael turits i know im just trying to suck up i wanted to get on your good side mark sachleben hopefully well get the one out of the way right we were pleased with the billings numbers and the deferred numbers and we do expect to see continued seasonality as weve seen this year at the end of the day were becoming more and more of an enterprise company and those deals tend to cluster around the december the calendar yearend and the march our fiscal yearend dates and so were seeing more new deals and more renewals and things cluster around those dates so i think well see similar patterns going forward as we saw emerge this year michael turits okay and then for my nonbillings question talk a little bit if you would lew about the competitive landscape especially obviously with appd over at cisco how things have or havent changed now and how you feel like youre doing lewis cirne sure michael id say theres not a dramatic change weve been happy with our win rate all along id say it has improved even more in recent months particularly if the customer is running in a cloud environment and so what were thinking about as we think about the competitive landscape is we want to think of if the application is in a public cloud environment we want to think of that as home turf where thats where we want a dominant win rate and then well take a good win rate with the applications running onpremise too but we want to continue to dominate in the cloud and we believe with appdynamics being now part of cisco we have an opportunity to even lengthen that lead based on their historical focus of being more geared towards the data center and onpremise workloads and from a networking point of view culturally so were very happy with our competitive position in the market we expect it to remain competitive because its an attractive space to be in but we believe if we continue to dominate in the cloud well have wonderful business for the long term michael turits great thanks lew thanks mark operator our next question comes from ben mcfadden from pacific crest securities benjamin j mcfadden hey guys thanks for taking my questions lew i wanted to start with this large deal that was announced a month ago that you talked about in the call i think you said  users in  countries if im right but im just curious if you could expand maybe even further around the footprint of this deal as to what degree as far as apps deployed are you potentially touching within this organization and what percentage may be onpremise versus public cloud and kind of how do you get this deal to potentially continue to grow from here any more color on that would be great lewis cirne sure so were thrilled about the deal and were thrilled about how it came about in that clearly we proved our value proposition time and time again over the course of years and it just came to a point where the customer recognized that every quarter they were kind of signing up for another substantial increase in their new relic investment and the time was right to discuss a much larger commitment where they can just be comfortable rolling out much more broadly and so while they signed up for the entire platform and there are  that means every one of our product is in this deal i would say in this particular case its skewed a bit more to apm in its distribution and so therefore while we see upside in many dimensions within this account in the future as they continue to grow a particular portion  a particularly large amount of upside will be in outside of apm and when we look at the trends of how our nonapm business is doing across the whole company we think that thats very attractive to us the workloads are a combination of onpremise and incloud but they are completely strategically bought into the cloud which is why i believe they made it clear  it was clear in their mind they wanted to be strategic with new relic because it lined up with where they are going strategically as well and so our ability to work well onpremise but to be incredibly differentiated in the cloud environment was a big part of why they felt comfortable being strategic with us benjamin j mcfadden great and then mark i just wanted to ask another question on seasonality without touching the deferred revenue question just in general as we think about  i think last year  in the past year you talked about the first two quarters being maybe stronger for new customer acquisition and then expanding as you go into the back half of the year as we think about sort of these enterprise customers are we still seeing some  a large portion land within the first two quarters or has the model shifted so much that its revolving significantly more around the back half of the year mark sachleben we are seeing in terms of overall business were seeing more strength in the back half of the year and that is driven by the enterprise the additional enterprise emphasis of the company and also the strength and as weve mentioned the enterprise will be more than half our business by the end of this year so thats having a larger overall impact in terms of the number of customers though if you look at the historical numbers for us we tend to  weve been adding roughly between  and  customers a quarter in the over k range and thats something that tends to skew actually a little bit larger toward the second half of the year so in the net in terms of seasonal pattern we think that is likely to be the case i think the thing you have to remember is when we add new customers the land and expand model is such that our new customers can be added  a lot of times theyre added at relatively small amounts and so in the first half of the year we could add customers and they could be a k or a k maybe a k customer and then expanding late in the year the latter half of the year well still be adding a lot of new customers but i think the overall impact in terms of the results for the quarter are more skewed toward the expansion deals because the expansion business tends to be stronger in the second half of the year benjamin j mcfadden thank you operator our next question comes from greg mcdowell with jmp gregory mcdowell great thank you very much i think one of the most interesting components or information you shared on the call so far is just the crosssell and so id like to ask about that infrastructure is one product that has not been in the marketplace very long and yet youve mentioned it was in  of the top  deals and i was just wondering if you could expand a little bit on some of the dynamics of including infrastructure and some of those large deals and were those greenfield opportunities were those replacement opportunities of an existing infrastructure provider and then i have one followup lewis cirne sure so i guess the way to look at it is from the customers perspective our customers generally feel its imperative to be successful with digital and theyre using the cloud typically to be successful with a new digital initiative and our vision resonates with them our vision is to be successful with digital you need visibility in the customer experience that could be the mobile application or the web on the front end of the web browser you also need visibility in the application and the third leg of the stool is visibility into the infrastructure underneath that application especially if its dynamic infrastructure in the cloud and they all should be in one unified platform easy to use saas delivered so that you can see the impact of infrastructure health and configuration and how that impacts the application in the customer experience that vision is resonating with our customers and so sometimes they may have an infrastructure monitoring product there are open source tools out there they may have used and this may be the first time for that project subscribing to a commercial offering sometimes we are replacing other offerings that are focused on the infrastructure layer its a bit of a mixture of both at the moment but whats driving it all is this unified view across customer experience application infrastructure on one easy to use platform so were going to continue to focus on that strategy its a winning strategy particularly when you look at customers running workloads in the cloud gregory mcdowell thank you and then one quick followup on project seymour certainly one team effort so far in this software earnings season has been machine learning and artificial intelligence it feels like its brought up on every earnings call so i was just hoping you could help maybe run through the key value proposition of seymour and maybe talk about  i know were still in limited beta here but what are some of the key milestones you guys need to hit this year before it goes ga lewis cirne great question and for us again im going to put it back to the customer and what theyre trying to achieve and what their challenges are our customers arent coming to us asking what can you do with ai our customers are saying my environment is incredibly complex there is so much going on so many micro services all trying to work in concert to deliver a great customer experience so many possible points of failure from the customer experience to the application to the infrastructure new relic can you help put into intelligence or code or algorithms  can you help automate the work of what humans have manually been doing in the past which is analyzing all this data and looking for problems or trying to identify the root cause of problem or identifying just interesting stuff in that data thats worthy of attention before they are problems so that has been a very human effort of just staring at data and trying to figure out whats interesting and actionable and then routing it to the right person who would actually have an interest and a role to play on based on whatever that insight is in the data thats the foundation of what were doing with seymour and so were using some buzzword friendly technology like machine learning were using other just straightforward algorithms that encode the best practices that weve discovered in application management over the hundreds of engineer years that we have in place in this domain and the results is our customers are using our products more and theyre finding it to be more of a daily habit so the vision of seymour is to drive more usage of our product because as we talked about in that  million deal its not a surprise or a coincidence that we have so many active users within that customer using our products on a regular basis so we believe if weve got more people using our product more often itll turn into healthier customer relationships and so to answer your question of like what do i pay attention to in order for it to be ready for prime time well this is going to be continual effort for us but were going to be a lot of attention to stickiness and active usage for seymour gregory mcdowell great thanks lew thanks mark operator your next question comes from sterling auty from jpmorgan sterling auty yes thanks hi guys i want to followup first on the land and expand item when you look at the expand part of the deals how much of the expand is coming from just followon apm and how much of it is from taking on new products and does that differ by the size of the customer lewis cirne sterling thanks the  it really varies we grow our customers we get in we get a toehold in the account and they continue to grow in several ways one is the application growth the environment growth and well sell more apm the other  and then another vector is we do go into apm only accounts more and more accounts are coming in with multiproducts to start but we do have accounts that still start with apm and theyll add additional products and then the third vector is moving to whole new environments it might be a new application in that same group or another division within the organization any of those vectors can be an expansion opportunity in terms of the size of the company i think all three of those can work in small and larger companies obviously the expansion of new applications and new divisions thats much more relevant in the enterprise but we see that still even in our smaller companies as well sterling auty and then one followup question the success that youve seen over the last several quarters has anything changed in terms of the top of funnel dynamics versus the close rates when you look at the gotomarket motion lewis cirne we studied those in depth as you can imagine and we see  were seeing fairly consistent patterns emerge and trends i dont think anything has changed dramatically we test things we try things fairly routinely and its interesting because you can run programs that really expand the top of the funnel and then youll see your conversion rates somewhere down the line maybe deteriorate and so you can convince yourself that metric is great but at the end of the day its what youre putting in and what youre getting out and thats really what we focus on and i think thats what we have to focus on long term to make sure were improving the efficiency of the business sterling auty thanks guys operator your next question comes from sanjit singh from morgan stanley sanjit singh thank you for taking the questions and congrats to the team on a strong fiscal year  lew i wanted to touch base on the security proposition that new relic can potentially play i think when i talk to your customers more and more the performance management apm embedded within an overall security architecture is the conversation that im having a lot and i noticed the relationship you signed with splunk so i just wanted to revisit your thoughts on how new relic fits into kind of these next generation security architectures and whats your vision there lewis cirne sure its a great question and just as a reminder to you and the other listeners whats interesting about our value proposition for security is that the web application typically is now the new point of attack into a business from the outside because by definition the web application is kind of exposing something to the outside world and therefore it could be a point of vulnerability and therefore our unique visibility inside the application and whats going on and if its changing is valuable telemetry to help security teams detect potential threats and attacks one of the interesting things we are doing in seymour is generating some alerts and cards that will notify when we see suspicious security events inside your applications so were dipping our toe in that space at the moment and certainly we and many of our customers use new relic insights for security use cases however we recognize that this is  the security market takes a lot of focus in order to do really well and so we are not yet quite ready at the point to develop  to devote the considerable sales and marketing resources required to really make it an area of priority and focus from a gotomarket perspective so were learning from our customers exactly how they use our product for security use cases and well continue to learn and have that in consideration as we think about our offering how we may more directly address the security use cases in the future and the last thing id say is we are thrilled about our splunk partnership we think its good for us because its good for our customers a lot of our customers are splunk customers and they rely on our digital intelligence platform as well as they rely on splunk and they want to see more data sharing between our platforms were happy to do that because it helps them be more successful and when our customers are successful theyll do a bit more business with us sanjit singh great and then one followup just in terms of some of the changes in terms of gotomarket outside of the promotion of erica anything from a sales force perspective thats going to be different this year versus last year anything major in terms of territory realignment quotas those types of things lewis cirne the short answer is no nothing like large or significant first of all i would say since we made the announcement at the very beginning of april shortly thereafter we had our annual sales kickoff and the overwhelming consistent feedback was it was our best sales kickoff ever and the level of excitement and enthusiasm and passion and confidence is at an alltime high in the field my hats off to erica for leading that incredibly well and her team erica did a great job in building out her lieutenants last year and so our regional leaders underneath erica have been in place for about a year now we feel like that team is in great shape and is stable and so we dont anticipate large changes that having been said were a growing business were always sort of asking what can we do better so we may make minor adjustments here or there but thats always been the case for our business historically and we expect that will be the way we do business for the foreseeable future sanjit singh understood thank you operator our next question comes from rob oliver from baird robert oliver great thank you guys mark i think i heard you mention that the largest deal was a consolidation of a bunch of smaller deals that have existed within an account and maybe lew to your point you talk about the opportunity to bring that unified vision as you look at enterprise pipeline now how many deals look like that in other words clearly you guys have tremendous mindshare with the devops community so how much of the pipeline looks like a bunch of smaller deals within an account where you have the opportunity to come in and unify those lewis cirne great question and i think one of the reasons why im so excited about new relics future and prospects so we have now  customers spending  million a year or more with us and thats nearly double in just  year right where did they come from well they were the  to  million class of last year and years prior so that category  we now have over  six figure customers over  of them and thats up  yearoveryear thats our farm team for the million dollar plus and  million customers theyre the stable of customers that will  some of them will ultimately be  million a year customers and thats my challenge to the field is whos going to bring in the  million new relic customer and i hope its this year so its this wonderful graduation steps that our customers go through and let me remind you the average spend across our customer base is only  now the good news is thats up from  at the day of our ipo which is what  years ago so its more than doubled and of course thats reflective on us going up market but were fine with bringing on a customer at a relatively low spend level because the product  if we continue to deliver a product that customers love to use and value then theyll increase their spend with us and ultimately it turns into these wonderful relationships of longterm subscribers at substantial investment levels robert oliver great thanks lew thanks guys operator your next question comes from jesse hulsing from goldman sachs kevin kumar hi this is kevin kumar on for jesse regarding project seymour how many customers are testing the product currently and when do you think they could be a material contributor to the model lewis cirne so were not at a point yet where we can describe customer counts except for to say like i love the growth that im seeing in usage across the beta customers and thats the key point how you think about seymour in the model is not a separate product on its own but rather a vehicle by which we drive more user engagement more stickiness and substantially more competitive advantage our competitors are onpremise we dont believe its possible to do something like this onpremise single tenant so its going to be a simple do you have something like seymour or dont you and we think the answer will be only new relic has something like seymour in our broader competitive space and so the way you think about how it will affect our business will be in win rates in usage and hopefully more and more of these customer relationships that look like the substantial deal we talked about during in the call and more of those  and  million customer relationships kevin kumar great thank you operator our next question comes from ittai kidron from oppenheimer ittai kidron thanks lew maybe you can talk about your two of your least popular children mobile and browser and how do you think about them lewis cirne whoever says they dont love all their children equally i love mobile and browser ittai kidron you dont mention them at all lewis cirne i dont  look its like when one of your children graduates from college thats who gets the attention that day so we had a great quarter for insights we had a great quarter for infrastructure mobile and browser are like it starts the customer experience right so the whole point of digital is delivering a great customer experience every customer interaction must be measured and we measure every mobile page load every browser action every time you buy a coffee on dunkin donuts we measure the health the speed of that transaction and if theres a crash we can go all the way down to the cause of that crash including all the steps prior to that crash thats must have data because the customer experience and the digital customer experience is the brand experience so yes these are super important products for us we believe they are perhaps among our most differentiated products theyre where our more direct competitors in the apm space really have the furthest to go in being competitive in that space and theyre often why especially if youve got a customer facing property why people select new relic ittai kidron got it and then mark for you excluding those two  the timing of this i guess  million billings that just kind of came without you expecting them to come in the quarter i mean without that your billings growth would have been up  correct me if im wrong on a yearoveryear basis the high on the year which makes sense seasonally i guess the question is though you look at the rest of the quarter as we think to fiscal  do you have a view on the year and what would you do expect billings growth to be in  is it low s on average for the year is that the kind of the right bogey to think about mark sachleben well i can confirm the math you did on the first calculation and if you take out that  million that is accurate in terms of billings going forward were not guiding directly to billings weve given some indication of deferred for the next quarter weve also talked about our operating income for the year our guidance for the end of the year our cash flow targets and when you combine  i think weve given enough information to sort of have a sense for what the year might look like we talked about how deferred will be seasonally similar to what it was last year with the exception of q because this q had those unusual items so i think weve given enough to triangulate to get a sense for it but we are not providing explicit guidance in terms of billings growth or deferred for the year ittai kidron okay and maybe i guess lastly on productivity how do you feel about the productivity of sales force right now the progression there and how do you think regarding the milestones youve put for the sales force for fiscal  i assumed theres an escalation out there i mean whats your initial kind of view into that how good do you feel about your ability to get those productivity levels up mark sachleben yes we feel good about the productivity that were seeing that weve seen and we continue to see you were a growth company and so we continue to hire aggressively particularly enterprise we are hiring across the smb as well but were investing more aggressively in the enterprise and so we still have at any given point in time we have a fair amount of our sales team that is ramping and is relatively new and so we continue to face the challenge and address the challenge of hiring good people enabling them and making sure they ramp to the point where they get to be successful fully ramped reps and were doing that at an aggressive pace but in terms of the overall productivity we like what we continue to see ittai kidron very good good luck guys operator our next question comes from derrick wood from cowen  company rakesh kumar hi guys this is rakesh kumar sitting in for derrick i was hoping to get more color on the aws partnership that started last month and on the joint development and gotomarket initiatives how is that trending and what are some of your initial findings lewis cirne well its still early with that particular portion of this partnership but were very encouraged by it what we really are encouraged by is how amazon and we at new relic jointly see the customer journey to the cloud and how we believe both companies see how we can help each other how do we help amazon well amazon benefits when customer workloads in the cloud move to the cloud faster and grow and what are the obstacles to moving workload to the cloud often its uncertainty about how the application will behave in a cloud environment or not quite enough confidence to really go full scale into the cloud environment because it is different from onpremise we give our customers confidence that they can deploy the cloud we can compare the applications behavior in an onpremise environment to the cloud environment show how often it behaves much more predictably and better and more cost effectively because you can right size the environment to the workload and that results in more customer confidence to move to amazon or to other cloud providers and let me be clear we are partnering with all the major cloud providers because our value proposition is similar in each of those cases so thats how we help the cloud provider partners because the customer really does want an objective third party to give them that confidence it gives them so much more confidence if its new relic objectively measuring the health of the application in both environments rather than a tool maybe provided by the cloud provider that could claim that everything is fine thats always going to be a little harder for the customer really to get fully confident with and thats why were so important as an independent partner to serve in that role so theres more we are looking at doing with all of our cloud partners and the details arent yet ready to release but stay tuned but because were seeing this joint success its certainly a tailwind for our business and we think its helping amazon and our other partners accelerate their business as well rakesh kumar got it if i could ask a followup as well you closed a large deal with the insights product and it now accounts for almost  of your new business i was hoping to understand at what point in the apm journey does customer start to look at the insights product and if there is a dedicated sales motion for insights lewis cirne there is not a dedicated sales motion for insights and this particular use case was a wonderful one its not necessarily how all of our insights deals work but it is a wonderful story because in this particular case it was a ceo visible critical digital initiative something theyve been  the ceo has been on record talking about in the press about how it is important for their business and how excited they were about this project and so we not only engage with the development and the operation teams and talk about what we usually talk about reliability performance eliminating errors stability all of those things but we also engage with the product management team we ask them what is business success for this and theyre taking turns of new users and user stickiness and how many people get through the funnel from trial to paid and the kinds of things that business people think about and we said what if we could do a realtime dashboard that will present that data along with the performance data and the way we do that is through insights well that just transformed their view about new relic we are no longer just a tool for debugging code we were their strategic dashboard and thats where it became something that actually demoed to the ceo of the company and so it shouldnt be a surprise that after you get that level of traction were talking about these kinds of  this kind of visibility you start to see seven digit transactions just for insights alone so its transforming how our accounts think about new relic rakesh kumar thanks operator your last question comes from fatima boolani of ubs fatima boolani good afternoon thank you for taking the questions lew i wanted to followup on a comment you made its very clear that new relic is going to be doubling down even further on the enterprise side of the house and im curious as you get closer to the gotomarket operation and sales motions what your perspective is around offering elas or sort of all you can eat buffet options to really incent the adoption of the product portfolio thats expanded quite nicely in the last several years and a quick followup for mark if i may lewis cirne sure great great question and id like the  we dont necessarily think specifically in terms of elas my last company wily did that we like them to be more of a natural outcome of lots and lots of usage because in the case like the  million arr or  million tcb deal we talked about as i mentioned there were  transactions we did with this company every one of them at a higher unit price along the way so we were doing just fine doing one deal a quarter or multiple deals per quarter as we grew with them and so it made sense was a natural time for a winwin my worry about being an eladriven business is it often leads to an imbalance in the customer relationship where were trying to drive the bus too hard and the customer is not ready for it it can turn into shelfware or it can turn into just a unit price that we dont think is right for us in the long term so id rather kind of get there when were ready and the customer is ready driven by us demonstrating success in the customer environment and thats how were going to think about our customer relationship in the future but its great to demonstrate that we can get to this new level of spend with the large enterprise and show that the value proposition we have is strategic fatima boolani thats very helpful and mark a quick question for you on gross margin it continued to be pretty resilient and trending towards the high end and even maybe above your longerterm targets and i would have presumed as you kind of march up market or for larger customers who presumably have more complex instantiation requirements and more complex general environments im wondering if you can help us understand kind of the puts and takes into the gross margin line and thats it for me mark sachleben okay sure we are incredibly proud of our gross margins and youre absolutely right the complexity of dealing with the enterprise organizations has certainly increased and you would normally think that with the pressure in your gross margin i think its a testament to the engineering team that weve done and our ability to really be efficient in serving that if you think about it the amount of data we collect today per customer is much greater than it was a couple of years ago looking forward its going to be much greater than it is now and the challenge is going to be to continue to keep being efficient when you look at whats historically gone on you have a couple of things happening one is things like our credit card cost which is a decent component of our cost of sales as more and more customers move to  or more of our business moves to the enterprise we end up with more and more invoicing and lower percentage of credit card costs our capitalized software has been fairly flat over time in the last few years and so as a percentage of revenue its been going down so when you look at the amortization hit to the gross margin thats been declining as a percent as well so there have been a couple of things like that that have been helping us so weve been  while were thrilled with where it is we have been guiding to get closer  to drift downward toward our longterm targets of the  to  fatima boolani

management service webpage wwwnewreliccom blog blognewreliccom twitter newrelic sweetlew watch part  part  matthew hi this is matthew wise at founderly we empower entrepreneurs to have a voice and share their story with the world enabling others to learn about building products and starting companies it is with great pleasure that i’m here today with lewis cirne who is the founder of new relic over  thousand companies use new relic to monitor the performance of their web apps with that said lew we’d love for you to give our audience a brief bio lew sure my name is lew cirne i’ve been in software ever since ’ when my mom bought me a vik and she said she hasn’t seen me since but i’ve always been a passionate technologist who loves building software it started off professionally at apple in ’ in between the tenures of steve jobs so i learned a lot about building products that people love but got the bug for being an entrepreneur i think just by being in silicon valley in the early ’s so in ’ i founded my first company called wily technology and wily is the first company in now a very large market called web application performance management and wily is a leading company in that space providing visibility and performance monitoring for live production web applications and wily was acquired in  by ca a company sometimes known as computers associates and that was a great successful outcome for all the stakeholders and wily continues to do great business for large enterprises today in monitoring production websites new relic is my doover at the same problem space learning everything i learned in my first startup and the eight years i put into that i thought what can we do to address web applications performance today and focus on a new model that is delivered as a service rather than onpremise software supporting newer applications in frameworks running in the cloud and running on languages like ruby on rails or php or python as well as java and dotnet and being just a lot easier to use so you hear a lot about consumerization of it and in my mind that primarily means software that’s easy to use that you don’t want to inflict pain upon people when they have to open up their enterprise software applications so we try to build software that our customers fall in love with and want to buy without even having to talk to a sales rep and new relic is basically succeeding very well in that model and as you mentioned in the beginning we now have over  i think about  customers using our software to keep their web applications fast matthew what makes new relic unique who’s it for and why are you so passionate about it lew well i think what makes it unique is we’ve got software that a developer can get up and running with in literally a couple of minutes and instantly have visibility that they had honestly didn’t think was even possible so by installing a little bit of code provided by us we call it our agent just installing that library inside the web application and then restarting that web application on its server within a minute you’re going to see deeply how fast your app is running and what is the code that is contributing to any performance problems you might have it’s like xray vision for your live web app and what amazes our customers is just how easy it is to get going and how little pain is involved in setting up or seeing the data making sense of the data and making your website faster that’s why we’ve got such strong business tractions because the product delivers so much value that people just try it out and they like it and they want to become paying customers matthew what are some of the technology and market trends that currently exist and where do you see things developing in the future for your space lew well there are a couple of big trends that are exciting to me obviously virtually everybody is talking about cloud computing and for good reason the fact that people can get infrastructure on demand at any moment in time allows them to rapidly roll out web applications and not have to think about procuring servers etc and the layer above that platform is a service that’s obviously very interesting as well if you look at companies like salesforce’s heroku acquisition or engineyard or what vmware is doing and while there is at least  players now doing platform as a service basically what that’s saying is the application server is really going in the way of history and is being replaced by live platform as a service all this means is that people who can write software have fewer and fewer barriers to publishing that software immediately and scaling it as needed but what’s in the way is the visibility in the performance monitoring that tells them whether or not their application is actually servicing the end user whether there are performance problems and when to add more capacity and what you need to do to make your site service the demands that your customers are putting on it that’s where we come in so virtually every platform is a service provider integrates with new relic provides new relic to the end customers for example we have thousand of heroku customers using us to monitor their applications running with either ruby or in java or we just announced python last week we can go through the list of all virtually all of the platforms of the service providers who provide that as well there’s a second trend that i’ll speak to briefly and that is that you know kudos have to go to salesforce for really pioneering the whole idea of software as a service and businesses shouldn’t be wasting their time and resources managing software they should be pursuing their business objectives and if you look at why cloud computing is so popular it’s because people could just get the infrastructure they need right away well the same should be true for your monitoring software if you want resources to be available right away and you don’t want to worry about installing machines to run your application then you certainly don’t want to be installing software to monitor your application you don’t want to be delayed in launching your application because you’ve got to install and maintain the monitoring software you want that to be just as available and ready to use as your infrastructure on demand is and so we think that providing application monitoring as a saas model and we’re the first company to do it and by far the dominant leader that’s really a game changer it means that people can just focus on running their business not managing their management software matthew we covered your background and a review of your market we’d love to get into the story of how new relic started as i understand you’re a single founder lew right matthew how is like to be a single founder and how did you know you wanted to start new relic lew sure sure well really to answer that you’ve got to first take into perspective my first company that i was also the sole founder of wily technology so i’ve always been a passionate technical person but i had a broader set of interests than that when i was an undergrad i had a computer science degree but i also pursued classical studies i almost double majored in cs as well as the likes of latin and greek so that breadth of interest i think led me to wanting to be involved beyond just the core technology and to really thinking about what does it take to build a successful business and wily was a great learning experience along the way for that i was learning on the job as a first time manager and ceo there i brought in a professional ceo after the company was about  or  people in four years into the job and moved to a cto role and that was great and a wonderful experience after wily was acquired and that was for about  million it was the largest acquisitions ca has done in the last ten years so there’s certainly no regrets about how wily turned out i took a year off and i asked myself what would i do different learning everything i’ve learned and there are a few key things that i’ve learned one was in the first time around like almost all enterprise software companies when you’re selling a product for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars you end up often modifying your product almost for every customer that you bring on because they’re paying such a large ticket price for the software you try to accommodate the requests and what you end up doing is just continuously modifying the product until it becomes not very cohesive and you’re trying to serve all everybody and in the process you do a mediocre job of just being good at core whereas prices are designed for tens of thousands of customers instead of a few hundred customers have to be scaled and therefore simple to use so my inspiration actually for new relic was this was just after the iphone came out and the iphone was the first phone that i had ever seen where you could set it up in the comfort of your own phone in the comfort of your own home i should say you didn’t have to go inside the att store wait for somebody to press a bunch of cryptic keys and install a sim card and go away behind the desk and come back to you and say ok your phone is ready because apple invested in how does somebody take it out of the box and fall in love with the product without any help and i said i thought to myself enterprise software should be that way too we shouldn’t need to hire people to go onsite to our customers to tell them how to get going with the software the software should educate the customer on their own if we don’t have to hire all those people to go onsite to educate the customer we could in effect reduce the cost of sales and reduce the price of the product so we can build a better product like the iphone was better than its predecessors but we can distribute it for less money and therefore we could reduce prices by  and still have a more profitable company and that was where the whole combination of technology product and business model got me really excited about new relic matthew from idea to product launch how long did that take and when did you actually launch new relic lew it’s pretty funny that story just a sec i started working on new relic really when i was taking that year off and honestly i was just looking for something interesting to do when i wasn’t golfing or playing around with my daughter who was only one at the time and so i just got curious about technology again and i started playing around with this then new thing called ruby on rails and the funny thing about it is when people learn new programming languages usually you write after you write hello world you try to write a little bit of an application that has some complexity to it well the first app i wrote ruby on rails was new relic and it monitored itself so this was really started off as really me just trying out a new technology and because my background is in application performance management i’ve been doing it for  years now i ended up building something that now is used by all these companies but at the beginning it was just a research experiment so the first lines of code were written in between rounds at golf in august of ’ but i got serious with it when i had a prototype that was kind of meaningful and interesting to some people in the rails community in about november december got a series a term sheet from a good friend of mine peter fenton  over at benchmark i’ve worked with peter before my last company he’s an excellent vc and so we decided to try to make a company out of this and so i raised series a in january of ’ and we launched in june of ’ so really we got to market pretty fast after we decided to make a business out of this matthew are there any unique metrics or social proof about new relic that you’d like to share with our audience lew sure well i’ve mentioned a number of people using the product and that’s obviously important we collected an enormous amount of application performance data we measure the performance of two billion page reviews a week across thousands of websites the likes of which include groupon airbnb zynga as well as more established companies like comcast or att we collect over   billion metrics a day of the performance of these web applications because we’ve got our code sitting inside every java process every php process every python process and sending hundreds of metrics continually to say this is how long the database time took or this is how long the page rendering time took and many open more granular metrics than that so being to collect tens of billions of performance metrics a day and be able to show that information to our customers so that up to the minute they can say how fast is my site now and how is that occasional time breaking down and being to do that really fast while you’re collecting so much data at the same time is no small technical feat let’s see what are some other pretty impressive things so we support those  customers with one support rep and how do we do that well and they get timely support too i mean their questions are answered etc so there’s sort of how does that happen well we’ve been pretty disciplined about building software that not only works but is easy for the customer to operate on their own again kind of like the inspiration in the iphone where you don’t need to call technical support to activate your iphone most of the time we’re trying to do that for enterprise software and if we have way too many support cases then the first question we ask is why isn’t the product easier for people to use without having to call support not why don’t we hire a hundred more support reps we also put engineers on a good number of the support cases so our dedicated support rep does handle the inbound requests but works directly with engineers and our engineers would rather be running code so it’s further incentive for them to write high quality code that is easier for the end user to use without having to contact support and that’s a way to incent our engineers to keep doing what they love doing and also when they’re on support tickets when you’re hearing from the engineer who owns the product as an end customer you tend to have a better experience with support because you’ve got very technical answers to your questions and the customers are very technical   podcast play in new window  download subscribe to our newsletter tweets by founderly search for       pages about usabout us

pm the arc of development as a founder is learning how to delegate and trust others new relic is a cloudbased web app performance management service webpage wwwnewreliccom blog blognewreliccom twitter newrelic sweetlew watch part  part  matthew hi this is matthew wise at founderly we empower entrepreneurs to have a voice and share their story with the world enabling others to learn about building products and starting companies it is with great pleasure that i’m here today with lewis cirne who is the founder of new relic over  thousand companies use new relic to monitor the performance of their web apps with that said lew we’d love for you to give our audience a brief bio lew sure my name is lew cirne i’ve been in software ever since ’ when my mom bought me a vik and she said she hasn’t seen me since but i’ve always been a passionate technologist who loves building software it started off professionally at apple in ’ in between the tenures of steve jobs so i learned a lot about building products that people love but got the bug for being an entrepreneur i think just by being in silicon valley in the early ’s so in ’ i founded my first company called wily technology and wily is the first company in now a very large market called web application performance management and wily is a leading company in that space providing visibility and performance monitoring for live production web applications and wily was acquired in  by ca a company sometimes known as computers associates and that was a great successful outcome for all the stakeholders and wily continues to do great business for large enterprises today in monitoring production websites new relic is my doover at the same problem space learning everything i learned in my first startup and the eight years i put into that i thought what can we do to address web applications performance today and focus on a new model that is delivered as a service rather than onpremise software supporting newer applications in frameworks running in the cloud and running on languages like ruby on rails or php or python as well as java and dotnet and being just a lot easier to use so you hear a lot about consumerization of it and in my mind that primarily means software that’s easy to use that you don’t want to inflict pain upon people when they have to open up their enterprise software applications so we try to build software that our customers fall in love with and want to buy without even having to talk to a sales rep and new relic is basically succeeding very well in that model and as you mentioned in the beginning we now have over  i think about  customers using our software to keep their web applications fast matthew what makes new relic unique who’s it for and why are you so passionate about it lew well i think what makes it unique is we’ve got software that a developer can get up and running with in literally a couple of minutes and instantly have visibility that they had honestly didn’t think was even possible so by installing a little bit of code provided by us we call it our agent just installing that library inside the web application and then restarting that web application on its server within a minute you’re going to see deeply how fast your app is running and what is the code that is contributing to any performance problems you might have it’s like xray vision for your live web app and what amazes our customers is just how easy it is to get going and how little pain is involved in setting up or seeing the data making sense of the data and making your website faster that’s why we’ve got such strong business tractions because the product delivers so much value that people just try it out and they like it and they want to become paying customers matthew what are some of the technology and market trends that currently exist and where do you see things developing in the future for your space lew well there are a couple of big trends that are exciting to me obviously virtually everybody is talking about cloud computing and for good reason the fact that people can get infrastructure on demand at any moment in time allows them to rapidly roll out web applications and not have to think about procuring servers etc and the layer above that platform is a service that’s obviously very interesting as well if you look at companies like salesforce’s heroku acquisition or engineyard or what vmware is doing and while there is at least  players now doing platform as a service basically what that’s saying is the application server is really going in the way of history and is being replaced by live platform as a service all this means is that people who can write software have fewer and fewer barriers to publishing that software immediately and scaling it as needed but what’s in the way is the visibility in the performance monitoring that tells them whether or not their application is actually servicing the end user whether there are performance problems and when to add more capacity and what you need to do to make your site service the demands that your customers are putting on it that’s where we come in so virtually every platform is a service provider integrates with new relic provides new relic to the end customers for example we have thousand of heroku customers using us to monitor their applications running with either ruby or in java or we just announced python last week we can go through the list of all virtually all of the platforms of the service providers who provide that as well there’s a second trend that i’ll speak to briefly and that is that you know kudos have to go to salesforce for really pioneering the whole idea of software as a service and businesses shouldn’t be wasting their time and resources managing software they should be pursuing their business objectives and if you look at why cloud computing is so popular it’s because people could just get the infrastructure they need right away well the same should be true for your monitoring software if you want resources to be available right away and you don’t want to worry about installing machines to run your application then you certainly don’t want to be installing software to monitor your application you don’t want to be delayed in launching your application because you’ve got to install and maintain the monitoring software you want that to be just as available and ready to use as your infrastructure on demand is and so we think that providing application monitoring as a saas model and we’re the first company to do it and by far the dominant leader that’s really a game changer it means that people can just focus on running their business not managing their management software matthew we covered your background and a review of your market we’d love to get into the story of how new relic started as i understand you’re a single founder lew right matthew how is like to be a single founder and how did you know you wanted to start new relic lew sure sure well really to answer that you’ve got to first take into perspective my first company that i was also the sole founder of wily technology so i’ve always been a passionate technical person but i had a broader set of interests than that when i was an undergrad i had a computer science degree but i also pursued classical studies i almost double majored in cs as well as the likes of latin and greek so that breadth of interest i think led me to wanting to be involved beyond just the core technology and to really thinking about what does it take to build a successful business and wily was a great learning experience along the way for that i was learning on the job as a first time manager and ceo there i brought in a professional ceo after the company was about  or  people in four years into the job and moved to a cto role and that was great and a wonderful experience after wily was acquired and that was for about  million it was the largest acquisitions ca has done in the last ten years so there’s certainly no regrets about how wily turned out i took a year off and i asked myself what would i do different learning everything i’ve learned and there are a few key things that i’ve learned one was in the first time around like almost all enterprise software companies when you’re selling a product for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars you end up often modifying your product almost for every customer that you bring on because they’re paying such a large ticket price for the software you try to accommodate the requests and what you end up doing is just continuously modifying the product until it becomes not very cohesive and you’re trying to serve all everybody and in the process you do a mediocre job of just being good at core whereas prices are designed for tens of thousands of customers instead of a few hundred customers have to be scaled and therefore simple to use so my inspiration actually for new relic was this was just after the iphone came out and the iphone was the first phone that i had ever seen where you could set it up in the comfort of your own phone in the comfort of your own home i should say you didn’t have to go inside the att store wait for somebody to press a bunch of cryptic keys and install a sim card and go away behind the desk and come back to you and say ok your phone is ready because apple invested in how does somebody take it out of the box and fall in love with the product without any help and i said i thought to myself enterprise software should be that way too we shouldn’t need to hire people to go onsite to our customers to tell them how to get going with the software the software should educate the customer on their own if we don’t have to hire all those people to go onsite to educate the customer we could in effect reduce the cost of sales and reduce the price of the product so we can build a better product like the iphone was better than its predecessors but we can distribute it for less money and therefore we could reduce prices by  and still have a more profitable company and that was where the whole combination of technology product and business model got me really excited about new relic matthew from idea to product launch how long did that take and when did you actually launch new relic lew it’s pretty funny that story just a sec i started working on new relic really when i was taking that year off and honestly i was just looking for something interesting to do when i wasn’t golfing or playing around with my daughter who was only one at the time and so i just got curious about technology again and i started playing around with this then new thing called ruby on rails and the funny thing about it is when people learn
