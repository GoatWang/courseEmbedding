brittany dandy    posted april   a   a   a   imageworlddeedscom advocacy and awareness for change seem to be a rising millennial trend especially when it comes to their business however studies show that millennials’ dedication to changing the world around them  is becoming more like the millennial way of life related how one young professional is creating a network to connect female entrepreneurs recent reports show that small businesses rooted in social consciousness like world deeds clothing company owned and operated by yearold eric whitaker are becoming far more popular whitaker founded the company with is his older brother as a means to become an entrepreneur and to contribute to the world around him their colorful tshirt line highlights social issues such a world hunger homelessness war and gender equality–with every purchase benefiting someone in need  each design is sketched with a cause in mind and bares symbolic meaning buying one tee or tank can provide as much as one pound of food for the povertystricken “we have helped over  people so far with meals volunteer work and donating the feeling is priceless “says whitaker “i feel like i need to do more and help as many people as i can this is a good addiction to have” according to the millennials report millennials are not solely virtually connected like many baby boomers may like to believe they happen to sincerely value the role they play in their communities while whitaker does spend quite some time signed into facebook and twitter as those are his main marketing tools he says it came with little surprise that the majority of his world deeds fanbase happens to be millennials specifically millennial women between the ages of – making up  of his social following black enterprise caught up with eric whitaker to talk social entrepreneurship his millennial supporters and world deeds clothing tell me a little about yourself and what it is that you do for a living my name is eric whitaker i’m originally from palmdale california and now reside in upper marlboro md by day i’m a general manager for a fortune  company and ceo of world deeds all the time how did you make the transition into entrepreneurship and why it was not easy making the transition into entrepreneurship the first thing i had to do was recondition my mind for so long i was conditioned to believe working a  was the only option to do this i started reading everyday for a year i read back then it would take a week to get through a book–maybe more– but now a book every two days is the norm anything from finance to biographies about how others have done it before this was all helping me condition the mind and preparing for this task my father always wanted to have a family owned business that brings us all closer while he said it i decided to make the dream come true while i’ve always had aspirations to be an entrepreneur this extra motivation pushed me even more how does world deeds work and where is your passion within its cause world deeds is clothing with a cause every three months we come out with a collection that focuses on a different social issue whether it is hunger poverty gender equality or war we want to not only bring awareness but take action that is why for every purchase we donate to a charity that supports that cause i have always wanted to help people in some way i was a peer counselor since middle school and a psych major in college this has always been my goal in life this is a way for my family to be involved and make a difference why do you think millennials feel the need to give and remain socially aware millennials have grown up with technology education and an unbelievable amount of knowledge at their fingertips they will be the most well educated generation in history when you have knowledge you know giving back is the right thing to do when you have the world at your disposal you have no choice but to be socially aware twitter facebook youtube and instagram have made it so easy to get almost instant news from around the world with knowing what’s going on i believe people want to get involved and be a part of something bigger than themselves why do you believe women have gravitated towards your brand this generation of women are givers we all want to be apart of a movement and we all want to be better than the generation before us with this brand you can give back and know you are doing something good you were going to purchase a shirt or a tank top anyway why not purchase one that also donates a pound of food to fight hunger what was your big “aha” moment i met a gentleman through my father that owned his own tshirt company for  years he was a tough guy to talk to and really wasn’t willing to converse with just anyone i asked him if it was okay for me to get his input on a few things and he scheduled a time for us to talk i was thinking if he likes the vision than i might be on to something he was instantly willing to mentor me and helped me with my first sale which was  shirts to a business owner this was before we had a website or even the product this gentleman was so on board he placed an order because it was for a good cause and i then knew we might be okay to find out more or shop whitaker’s tshirts that give visit world deedscom ﻿ ﻿ related stories jessica sutherland talks homeless to

deedskuedu primary office   c mrb bio using computational approaches to understand the dynamics and evolution of complex biological networks a wide variety of processes in the cell depend on the function of large complexes  a major focus of our lab involves using computational modeling to understand how macromolecular structures assemble from their component parts  our work is aimed at providing fundamental insights into assembly mechanisms with the ultimate goal of developing strategies that could disrupt or enhance the assembly of medically relevant complexes  the results of our work also provide general rules that can be applied in the design and construction of synthetic complexes that will selfassembly efficiently in one set of projects we are considering the assembly dynamics of macromolecular structures that contain rings  many important complexes such as the proteasome the chaperonin groel and the apoptosome which is involved in programmed cell death        consist either of single rings or of multiple rings stacked on top of one another  we have characterized some of the challenges that face simple ringlike structures as they assemble and have discovered mechanisms that complexes could employ to assemble with optimal efficiency  we are currently extending this work to the study of stacked rings with a particular focus on complexes for which there is experimental evidence of selfassembly  the predictions of these models are being tested experimentally through our collaborations with a number of groups at ku a second major focus of the lab involves understanding how cells process information from their environment  this task is often accomplished by signaling networks in which proteins interact with one another to propagate extracellular signals to the appropriate cellular response  the structure of these networks varies widely in evolution  bacteria for instance utilize highly linear signaling networks in which a single protein called the sensor kinase directly activates a second protein called the response regulator  in contrast metazoan networks like those found in human cells are generally incredibly complex with a massive degree of crosstalk between the receptors on the cell surface and the transcription factors that control cellular responses  our lab is using a combination of computational modeling data analysis and collaborations with experimental groups to understand the evolutionary pressures that have led to such different global topologies representative publications rowland m a and deeds e j

coming together beautifully here with one heck of a great rhythm section the players are all familiar but the sound is nice and fresh – thanks to really strong interplay between the tenors of eric alexander and grant stewart – both driven onward with energy that almost reminds us of a johnny griffineddie davis session from way back theres plenty of that older soul on some of these tunes – mixed with a few that have a bit more poise too – a good balance thats handled well in the rhythms by david hazeltine on piano john webber on bass and joe farnsworth on drums titles include rd bossa crying

only wrong thing about the record this might include but isnt limited to warped records tracks that skip cover damage or wear as noted above or strictly cosmetic flaws used cd grade we have only one grade for nonnew cds at dusty groove — used cd this grade is somewhat allencompassing but we choose it because we try to offer used cds in the best shape possible all of our used cds are guaranteed to play without skipping or flaws if you purchase a used cd from dusty groove you have  week to play it to determine that it plays correctly — and if it does not then you may return it for a full refund with our used cds you can expect the disc to be free of all but the lightest of surface marks — clean and not dirty at all you can also expect the case to be clean we often change the cases ourselves — putting fresh cases on used cds we handle — and you can expect the booklet to be in good shape unless noted otherwise we will list any specific detailsdefects underneath the item — so look for notes
