possible suppliers have access to the order advantageously essentially all eligible suppliers have access to identify a product as being in stock if prior suppliers fail to identify a product as being in stock preferably when a buyer enters data indicating that buyer accepts same day delivery and thereby gives priority to a supplier providing same day deliver over a supplier who identifies an ordered product as being back ordered or unavailablebrief description of the drawings  the figure is a flow chart of the process of the present inventiondescription of the preferred embodiments of the invention  the invention can be described by viewing an example of an order control tracking service provider system example  order control tracking  networking environment  during business hours at the suppliers offices at least one computer is on line with the backend software of the order control tracking service providers web site as for example partscom the software provides automatically updated lists of orders ready to be fulfilled returns to be processed offers order tracking and historical information as well as managerial and accounting reports  order fulfillment  a prospective buyer logs on to the system from a remote computer station most commonly via the internet when the buyer completes an order the orders selected item or items change status to “ordered” and selected suppliers begin seeing the selected item or items on their remote supplier computer screens the eligible suppliers are sorted in order of distance from the buyers shipping address on the basis of nearest to furthest when sorting the tiebreaker for same distance is a round robin order number plus supplier number then modulo maximum supplier number  in the first  minutes after the order is completed the nearest eligible supplier is the only one who sees the item or items displayed on a computer screen by the backend software if the prospective supplier does not mark the item or items as “in stock” within the  minutes the next  eligible suppliers have access and after another  min the nest  eligible suppliers have access this process continues until all possible suppliers have access to the order within  minutes every eligible supplier may handle the fulfillment of the item if its not already in stock at a nearer eligible supplier this method gives the nearest eligible supplier some exclusive time period in which to make a reasoned inventory decision and yet within a reasonable amount of time the system also can find a supplier for scarce infrequently stocked products  preferably orders for multiple products are assigned to a single supplier or a minimum number of suppliers in order to avoid breaking an order of several items between several competing suppliers all items for the order of a make or brand for which the supplier is an eligible source are marked on the form at the same time optionally orders containing a large number of items can be broken down so that availability may be reasonable checked in  minute time period  in addition to indicating each item on the computer screen form the possible computer screen buttons are  in stock  backordered until supplier must fill in date only selectable by predetermined authorized supplier levels and only if same day delivery in not required  unavailable default when the form opens  if the eligible supplier is local and the buyer prefers delivery rather than shipping the form can display fields for the deliverys estimated time of arrival  if the nearest eligible supplier does not respond within  minutes the next  nearest eligible suppliers see the items the order is considered filled if the nearest eligible supplier responds that all items are “in stock” otherwise items not in stock move to the next  nearest eligible suppliers those suppliers only see the partial order that is yet unfilled the software does not necessarily wait for  min to elapse for example as soon as all suppliers in this  min period have responded to all items of the specific order the order is ready to escalate to the next group of suppliers if appropriate  since competing suppliers can be submitting the form to the central computer a “first come first serve” procedure can be employed according to the following status precedence  when a supplier responds “backordered it bumps “unavailable” when a supplier responds “in stock” it bumps “unavailable” when the buyer accepts sameday delivery and a local supplier responds “in stock” it bumps “backordered” or “unavailable” the term “bumps” as employed herein refers to the procedure of displacing or preempting a competing supplier  naturally any item whose status cant be bumped by any subsequent supplier should not be displayed to those suppliers  once all items on the order have a status of “in stock” or there is no further potential for other suppliers to bump a status always within  min an email is automatically sent to the buyer showing the status of each item potentially a complex case may show some items as being “in stock” at local suppliers delivering today other items as being “in stock” at nonlocal suppliers shipping today other items as “backordered” shipping later at an estimated date and yet other items as unavailable at any eligible supplier  order delivery  the computer software generates and displays a summary of orders and items ready to deliver with at least one item status of in stock and perhaps ready to deliver with at least on time status of backordered by the specific supplier smaller suppliers that handle relatively lower volume may view orders and their items listed  orders at a time whereas larger suppliers will search for and release backorders by product part number that they have received and process orders in a queue one by one with potentially several pickpackship supplier agents logged in and reading from the queue  however the supplier agent arrives at an item with “backordered” status the supplier agent can change the status to “in stock” to move the item to the readytodeliver list if it is determined that the item will probably not arrive in a reasonable time the supplier agent can click a link to email the order tracking service web sites staff member who can mark this “unavailable” the tracking service providers web site will charge the supplier an abandonment fee of  per item likewise however the supplier agent arrives at an item with in stock status he may click a link to email a partscom staff member who can mark this “backordered” or “unavailable” and charge the same fee  by viewing the page showing a single order ready to deliver all items that were “in stock” are changed to “delivering” disallowing the buyer to cancel the supplier agent has  min to pick and pack the items and submit a form with the purchase order number shipment tracking number and shipping charge for nonlocal suppliers or the purchase order number and delivery fleet vehicle number for local suppliers this marks all items that were “delivering” as now “delivered” if  min elapses and the form is not completed the tracking service provider will charge the supplier an abandonment fee of  per item that is why the queue showing the next ready order the choices are set to “deliver and continue” and deliver and quit”  when the form is submitted the credit card payment that was previously authorized is now captured for the items actually delivered along with the shipping cost if any any remaining items that are “backordered” should remain authorized for future capture and those that are “unavailable” have their authorization voided  the credit card capture is made using a transaction date of when the original items were marked “ordered” and a posting date of today of the amount captured on credit card  the tax is divided up between tax authorities and added to their current amounts payable as of the transaction date  commissions are computed on the nontax nonshipping item subtotals may each have different suppliers according to the rates below all commissions are added to their respective current amounts payable as of the posting date commission recipientconsumer buyerbusiness buyertracking service providerhigh level supplierlower level supplier  the remaining items subtotals and shipping cost is added to the current amounts payable to the delivering supplier as of the posting date  an email is sent to the buyer with the subject “order     delivered” it starts with “partscom needs your feed back in maintaining our high quality standards” and lists the order its items and delivery expectations it includes a link to the buyers “order tracking and returns” page and urges the buyer to visit this link after receiving and inspecting the products  order returns  this display shows a summary and details of “order items” that the buyer has marked “returning” the supplier agent then arranges for a delivery fleet vehicle to pick up the item or if originally shipped provide supplierpaid pick up service arrangements can be commented at this display including return shipment tracking number or delivery fleet vehicle number once the returned item is received the supplier agent can click a link to mark the item status “returned”  all of the computed amounts added to payables during the delivery process above are reversed though the accounting period used are the earliest ones unpaid from which to debit if the refund exceeds the amounts payable for any supplier an automatic email is sent to order control tracking service providers accounting department to collect from that supplier either way the credit card refund is automatically processed immediately  order tracking and history  a supplier agent can pull up a current or historical order ad hoc to view the items and details including current status on each order this is just like the buyers “order tracking and returns” page except all actions are disabled  reports  the managers overview report has several ataglance sections on a single page that is on a single computer screen  sales activity rows closing  that is actual sales divided by potential sales if everything were “in stock” and marked as soon as it appeared in the system gross sales net sales commissions received from others abandonment fees net income columns year to date month to date and last five daily posting including the current day  missed sales top five products not in stock that resulted in a missed sale during the prior month  backorders top five oldest items backorder  refund reasons top five number of incidents per supplier agent and reason  abandonment top five numbers of incidents per supplier agent  the backorder report lists all orders and at least one item on backorder status  the products report lists all oem part numbers ordered over the given date range showing quantities ordered quantities marked in stock quantities marked backordered quantities marker unavailable and quantities returned  the orders report lists all orders and their items eligible for this supplier whether current or historical for the given date range  additionally the workflow console can show realtime workload for the suppliers agents currently logged in as well as queue lag times this can be a decision making tool for managers to size and schedule their staff as well as review performance from specific staff members  the tracking system can interface with complimentary systems such as reynolds  reynolds adp and ucs inventory reports can be generated periodically and differences from the previous report can be sent to the order control tracking service provider to update its database of current inventory  additionally when an order comes in the system can be configured to mark in stock items automatically and ready them for pickpackship further interfacing with manufacturing suppliers such as okabe and their factory resource systems such as sap can be provided the order control tracking service provider can also interface with systems using industry standards like edi idoc and xml  interface with supplier system  a page is provided to identify the list price of a product unknown to the internal database therefore parts advisors only need to work on one item at a time it shows the item with make model year and comments and the parts advisor looks up the correct oem part number and list price out of other reference data whether as a book or in digital format with several parts advisors working during any single shift a single queue of unknown items feeds the next available parts advisor the queue of items can be split by make to increase the familiarity by the parts advisor  when a buyer needs advice the first chat message is generated automatically such as “hi im fred what mustang gt parts are you looking for” the name fred is an alias that could apply to any parts advisor who then will be dedicated to this buyer during the length of this order multitasking enable a parts advisor to support several chats simultaneously  a chat will result in one of these situations  the order item is resolved to a product with a known price  the buyer hangs up and continues shopping on his own  the parts advisor may hang up and block further chats from this buyer  parts advisor queue manger  the system can integrate with an industry standard call center operation software system for queuing and routing calls and chats within the  hour  day order control tracking service providers operations center especially when it involves advanced telephony  parts advisor quality manager  reports are generated showing summaries and details for parts advisors indicating the number of chats theyve engaged in quantitative ratings from buyers their items returned to items ordered ratio etc another report shows the leading number of incidents of parts advice and returns grouped by make model and category within the group it shows specific products next to which the buyer clicked to contact a parts advisor this report assists in the continual cleaning and enhancing of the oem catalog permitted parts advisors can be permitted to edit oem catalog online when mistakes are found and confirmed these edits can be authenticated or confirmed by acceptance from another parts advisor before being committed and visible to all other users  accounting reports  the reported identified as a credit card settlement report shows all posted charge captures and refunds sorted by credit card type and then by posting date this is used to reconcile merchant account activity  the supplier payable report shows all nonzero daily periods for each supplier within the given date range the same columns are included as are on the sales activity section of the managers overview report in order the control tracking service provider system  the tax payable report shows all nonzero quarterly periods for each tax authority  there is no posting step to indicate that the order control tracking service provider has paid a period it is assumed by the system that periods over  days old have been paid and that today yesterday the day before and three days ago are still unpaid  the foregoing example illustrates one specific embodiment of the invention it should be understood however that various details of the example are representative examples and are not intended to indicate a narrow construction of the invention for example the eligible suppliers can be sorted by a priority other than order of distance from the buyers shipping address as for example suppliers priority can be weighted on the basis of customer ratings history of quality of service ability to provide product rapidly or other criteria  reference to time periods such the time period of  minutes after the order is completed can be scaled upwardly or downwardly depending upon experience with the system similarly the incrementing of suppliers from the nearest to the next  and after another  min to the nest  eligible suppliers can be modified as needed in the first instance for example the buyer can be offered the opportunity to place an order with a plurality of first tier suppliers this process need only continue until all possible suppliers have had access to the order within a limited time period as for example  minutes every eligible supplier can be given the opportunity to handle the fulfillment of the item if its not already in stock at a nearer eligible supplier  this critical factor is to give priority to the nearest eligible supplier by virtue of an exclusive time period while within a reasonable amount of time finding a supplier for scarce infrequently stocked products  while it is preferably to assign orders for multiple products to a single supplier or a minimum number of suppliers the system can provide for a reasonable sharing of an order as for example in order to expedite processing of the order  it is again noted that time periods identified in the example are preferred approximate time periods that can be scaled upwardly or downwardly to suit specific contingencies  the reference in the example to the listing of  orders at a time is noted to be a preferred quantity but larger listings can also be provided  the tracking service providers web site charging of an abandonment fee of  per item is a preferred representative value the fee can range from zero to any desired value  the supplier agent has been noted as having approximately  min to pick and pack the items and submit a form with the purchase order number and other relevant information again this time period is preferred but is not narrowly critical all time periods are noted to be approximate   previous patent systems and methods
