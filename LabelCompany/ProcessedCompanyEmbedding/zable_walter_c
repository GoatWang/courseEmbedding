impression walter j zable grew up in south boston during the great depression life was hard times were tough and sports gave him the chance to go to college and a way to escape things that might have kept him from the life he was destined to lead “sports put him through school and helped him make a bit of a living” says his son walter c zable “if it hadn’t been for sports he probably wouldn’t have gone to college that’s why he always had such an affinity for sports and why it was important to him to help other athletes” it was through sports that zable made a tremendous difference at usd where he served on the board of trustees from  to 99 where he endowed athletic scholarships and where the football field is named in his honor when zable passed away last summer at  usd learned that he and his late wife betty had designated  million from their estate to support torero athletics and fund athletic scholarships “from the early days of walter’s time on the board of trustees to the creation of the sports banquet to supporting multiple capital campaigns walter and betty zable and their family have graced usd with their generosity” says associate vice president for athletics ky snyder “the zable men’s basketball endowment and support of our most recent capital campaign ensures that the zable family’s support of our studentathletes will live on in perpetuity” zable is also remembered as a prominent engineer and entrepreneur in  zable founded cubic corporation an innovative electronics company that would grow rapidly from its humble beginnings in the family garage today cubic is a global market leader providing innovative solutions and services in the defense security and transportation markets it has a market cap of more than  billion “my mother was the company’s first

think much of organizational charts his management style was to give people the freedom to use their own imagination to design products” his parents established the walter j and betty c zable

graduates who are larger than life whose accomplishments are simply extraordinary and whose loyalty to their alma mater is the stuff of legend” said president taylor reveley “walt zable was such alumnus at the college of william  mary his alma mater salutes his marvelous life and mourns his loss zable stadium stands in our midst as an enduring remembrance of the great walt”zable a boston native turned down a scholarship offer from harvard to attend william  mary where he became an honorable mention allamerican in football while also lettering in baseball basketball and trackwhile at the college he received a bachelors degree in physics and met his late wife of  years betty virginia carter zable those academic and emotional ties to the school remained strong all of his life even after he moved to california in the early s“walt was one of the most respected men i ever met a tremendous businessman and a great supporter of the college especially the football program” said senior associate athletics director for development bobby dwyer “he was always so very proud not only of his football career but of his accomplishments in track his generosity to the college especially football was remarkable “whether it was giving for scholarships facilities endowments whatever  he was always there and he was so generous that he inspired others to give he was an absolutely remarkable man and its a huge loss for the william  mary community”in 99 he started his own business in his garage focused on microwave technology the business later moved to an office in point loma

built an electronic voting records system five decades ago “walt zable was a professionallevel athlete a brilliant and curious student a business visionary an exceedingly generous philanthropist” said
