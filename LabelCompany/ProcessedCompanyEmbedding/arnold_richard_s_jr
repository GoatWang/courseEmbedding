available at this link names arnolds grandson and estate executor shannon pollard as well as daughter jo ann arnold pollard and son richard e arnold jrwhen he sought the exhumation of arnolds body tanner told the court the determination of his parentage could only be carried out through genetic testing of the remains of arnold now however he argues that dna testing of arnolds son and daughter can prove his paternity claimthe petition seeks to have arnolds will and associated trust documents declared invalid it claims that at the time arnold signed them in  at the age of  his physical and mental condition had deteriorated to the point that he did not know who his children were it also asserts that the will is the product of undue influence by arnolds nashville family membersif the will

toward a woman who leapt out of the front seat of his squad car fearing he would rape her the incident took place on december   police came to the old matthews road home of wilson and her husband while they were having a domestic dispute and wilkins offered wilson a ride to the criminal justice center so she could swear out a warrant the officer drove past two crossstreets that would have led downtown and then turned onto brick church pike headed due north away from downtown during the drive the opinion states he rubbed and caressed wilsons hand three times looked at her seductively told her she was beautiful and said he wanted to date her when the car slowed wilson jumped out and ran toward the econolodge motel on brick church screaming at the top of her lungs she says she damaged
