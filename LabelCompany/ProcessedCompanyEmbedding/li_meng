social science reviews mcmc foundations methodology and algorithms overviews a variety of applicaiton areas with the goal of identifying the best mcmc practice through extended examples provides detailed case studies while clearly identifying the statistical issues encountered in each application supplies breadth and depth necessary to instruct a new generation of mcmc scientists and inspire current practitioners summary since their popularization in the s markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods have revolutionized statistical computing and have had an especially profound impact on the practice of bayesian statistics furthermore mcmc methods have enabled the development and use of intricate models in an astonishing array of disciplines as diverse as fisheries science and economics the wideranging practical importance of mcmc has sparked an expansive and deep investigation into fundamental markov chain theory the handbook of markov chain monte carlo provides a reference for the broad audience of developers and users of mcmc methodology interested in keeping up with cuttingedge theory and applications the first half of the book covers mcmc foundations methodology and algorithms the second half considers the use of mcmc in a variety of practical applications including in educational research astrophysics brain imaging ecology and sociology the indepth introductory section of the book allows graduate students and practicing scientists new to mcmc to become thoroughly acquainted with the basic theory algorithms and applications the book supplies detailed examples and case studies of realistic scientific problems presenting the diversity of methods used by the wideranging mcmc community those familiar with mcmc methods will find this book a useful refresher of current theory and recent developments table of contents foreword stephen p brooks andrew gelman galin l jones and xiaoli mengintroduction to mcmc charles j geyera short history of markov chain monte

simulation for hierarchical models analyzing ruralurban migration in thailand filiz garip and bruce western reviews … the uninitiated would greatly benefit from carefully reading the first three chapters …  for a more experienced and handson reader who is looking for uptodate developments and implementations of cuttingedge mcmc tools for highly complex problems the handbook brings twelve chapters with applications and case studies from areas ranging from genetics to highenergy astrophysics to item response theory to fisheries science … to sum up it is my opinion that the handbook might play for the next decade or so at least more or less the same role played by mcmc in practice in the mid s more precisely the handbook is bounded to provide theoretical and practical guidance to bayesian researchers and practitioners and why not nonbayesians alike to design implement and debug and package their own mcmc routines by taking advantage of the various inexpensive computational tools and the pressing need to analyze larger and more complex data frames—hedibert freitas lopes biometrics september  i found this to be a remarkable book on the current state of mcmc methods in statistics any newcomer to the field will appreciate the thoughtful collection of articles all written by wellknown people in the field including some pioneers of mcmc but also experts will find new aspects and the book as a valuable reference book —wolfgang polasek international statistical review  this handbook is edited by steve brooks andrew gelman galin jones and xiaoli meng all firstclass jedis of the mcmc galaxy … the outcome truly is excellent …the quality of the contents is clearly there and the book appears as a worthy successor to the tremendous markov chain monte carlo in practice by wally gilks sylvia richardson and david spiegelhalter … there are a few r codes here and there … i think the book can well be used at a teaching level as well as a reference on the stateoftheart mcmc technology—christian robert université paris dauphine on his blog september  … a valuable resource for those new to mcmc as well as to experienced practitioners … it is a collection of valuable information regarding a powerful computational approach to evaluating complex statistical models—john d cook maa reviews june  the handbook of markov chain monte carlo becomes the third volume in the attractive and useful chapman  hallcrc handbooks of modern statistical methods series the author list is worldclass developing  chapters half on the theory side half on applications the handbook provides a stateoftheart view of a technology that has revolutionized contemporary model fitting researchers at all levels of familiarity with mcmc will find novel morsels of material to chew on—alan e gelfand james b duke professor of statistical science duke university durham north carolina usa another home run for the chapman  hallcrc handbooks of modern statistical methods series this is a wonderful assemblage of the state of the art in mcmc methods from a worldclass collection of probabilists statisticians and biostatisticians known for their accomplishments in this area the first half of the book reviews and extends the key methodological ideas often beyond the usual bayesian settings while the second half offers a dozen beautiful case studies over a very broad range of modern applied statistical endeavor in my opinion this is the most significant book of its kind since the  chapman  hallcrc book mcmc in practice edited by gilks richardson and spiegelhalter it is a mustread
