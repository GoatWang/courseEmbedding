investment capital for equipment  our sales and marketing programs  investment capital for potential acquisitions  competition and  market developments critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period our management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements issuance of shares for noncash consideration the company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments to acquire goods andor services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance whichever is more reliably determinable the companys accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of standards issued by the fasb the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendors performance is complete in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  interestimputation of interest subtopic  asu  which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements asu  requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense it is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted the new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of asu  on its balance sheets in august  the fasb issued asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  deferral of the effective date asu  the amendment in this asu defers the effective date of asu no  for all entities for one year public business entities certain notforprofit entities and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in asu  to annual reporting periods beginning december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods with that reporting period in september  the fasb issued asu no  business combinations topic  asu  topic  requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination during the measurement period to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts the amendments in the update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined the acquirer is required to also record in the same periods financial statements the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects if any as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date in addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in currentperiod earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date asu  is effective for fiscal years beginning december   the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements in june  the fasb issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires sharebased compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition as such the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grantdate fair value of the award compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered if the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period the total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest the requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved this new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted entities may apply the amendments in this update either a prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or b retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in june  the fasb issued asu  development stage entities the amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the master glossary of the asc thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from us gaap in addition the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptiontodate information in the statements of income cash flows and shareholder equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity  disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage the amendments in this update are applied retrospectively the early adoption of asu  is permitted which removed the development stage entity financial reporting requirements from the company in june  the fasb issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities the amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from us gaap for development stage entities thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information the amendments in this update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in topic  consolidation for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk the amendments to eliminate that exception simplify us gaap by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities the elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis consolidation decision and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage the amendments related to the elimination of inceptiontodate information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of topic  should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to topic  which shall be applied prospectively for public companies those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein early adoption is permitted the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in august  the fasb issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in us auditing standards specifically the standard  provide a definition of the term substantial doubt  require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods  provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of managements plans  require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of managements plans  require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and  require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued the standard in this update is effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter early application is permitted the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in november  the fasb issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required that is an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract among other relevant criteria the amendments clarify how current gaap should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share the effects of initially adopting the amendments in this update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior periods the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in november  the fasb issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity after the effective date an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future changeincontrol events or to its most recent changeincontrol event however if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent changeincontrol event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle the amendments in this update are effective on november   the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or

form q business overview the companys business operations support securities crowdfunding scf activities scf in its simplest terms is a global movement towards broadening the investor base in small businesses by lowering accreditation standards of investors and changing the rules around the marketing of investment opportunities steven case the former aol exec often quips that an average middle class person can go to vegas and gamble away  but that same person cant invest  in facebook before its public the scf movement seeks to change this paradigm reports have been published that suggest fund raising through crowdfunding mechanisms will grow from the current b mark in  to over b in just the us alone in essence this suggests that the fundamental mechanism or process through which angel and seed funding will occur will be through technologyassisted scf platforms these platforms standardize the process make it more transparent for both investors and entrepreneurs and most importantly broaden the investor target reach or visibility the scf movement is less about blazing a new trail in new unchartered waters of finance but rather a shift towards utilizing technology platforms to make the existing process available to a wider audience less friction for all those involved as with the first wave of ecommerce the primary innovation will be simply expanding the potential audience for a given productoffering no longer will deal access be singularly controlled by the few with deep rolodexes the company believes and data suggests that most modern governments will push regulation towards a structure mirroring an environment like that seen in the uk today or the us with the jobs act changes these changes coupled with technology platforms that span geographic boundaries will enable a truly global network of small business funding just like a us consumer can buy products from the uk via the internet investors will be able to see and access deals regardless of their geographic location the company earns revenue by providing outsourced scf services including developing marketing programs for companies looking to utilize technology to reach a broader potential investor base the companys business does not contemplate a transaction or success fee component the scf industry is growing at a rapid pace and with regulatory changes promises to significantly enhance the access by lower middle market lmm companies to financing and investor access to private placements results of operations three months ended june   compared to three months ended june

impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions recurring losses or a forecasted inability to achieve breakeven operating results over an extended period the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows should impairment in value be indicated the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset asc  also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell the company performed an annual review for impairment and none existed as of december   issuance of shares for noncash consideration the company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments to acquire goods andor services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance whichever is more reliably determinable the companys accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of standards issued by the fasb the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendors performance is complete in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires sharebased compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition as such the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grantdate fair value of the award compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered if the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period the total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest the requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved this new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted entities may apply the amendments in this update either a prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or b retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in june  the fasb issued asu  development stage entities the amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the master glossary of the asc thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from us gaap in addition the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptiontodate information in the statements of income cash flows and shareholder equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity  disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage the amendments in this update are applied retrospectively the early adoption of asu  is permitted which removed the development stage entity financial reporting requirements from the company in june  the fasb issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities the amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from us gaap for development stage entities thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information the amendments in this update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in topic  consolidation for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk the amendments to eliminate that exception simplify us gaap by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities the elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis consolidation decision and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage the amendments related to the elimination of inceptiontodate information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of topic  should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to topic  which shall be applied prospectively for public companies those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein early adoption is permitted the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in august  the fasb issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in us auditing standards specifically the standard  provide a definition of the term substantial doubt  require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods  provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of managements plans  require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of managements plans  require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and  require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued the standard in this update is effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter early application is permitted the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in november  the fasb issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required that is an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract among other relevant criteria the amendments clarify how current gaap should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share the effects of initially adopting the amendments in this update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior periods the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in november  the fasb issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity after the effective date an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future changeincontrol events or to its most recent changeincontrol event however if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent changeincontrol event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle the amendments in this update are effective on november   the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or

incentive travel and leisure travel and mobile concierge services   business overview of crowd shares aftermarket inc   during the quarter ended september   the company began the development of a new business unit to support securities crowdfunding scf activities as part of this new business unit the company developed a scf platform and the business operations for supporting the company’s entrée into this new market the company’s scf platform includes an exchange for the trading of crowdfunded securities ie a second market for crowdfunded shares a front end issuer and investor scf portal for facilitating scf transactions and a us based broker dealer “bd” centric deal management and compliance platform for bd white labeling and syndication   the scf industry is growing at a rapid pace and with regulatory changes promises to significantly enhance the access by lower middle market “lmm” companies to financing and investor access to private placements   the company has developed the scf platform for use by the following     ⋅ issuers who have sold securities via crowdfunding platforms   ⋅ investors who have purchased securities via crowdfunding platforms   ⋅ licensed financial entities such as other finra member registered broker dealers   scf in its simplest terms is a global movement towards broadening the investor base in small businesses by lowering accreditation standards of investors and changing the rules around the marketing of investment opportunities steven case the former aol exec often quips that “an average middle class person can go to vegas and gamble away  but that same person can’t invest  in facebook before its public” the scf movement seeks to change this paradigm reports have been published that suggest fund raising through crowdfunding mechanisms will grow from the current b mark in  to over b in just the us alone in essence this suggests that the fundamental mechanism or process through which angel and seed funding will occur will be through technologyassisted scf platforms these platforms standardize the process make it more transparent for both investors and entrepreneurs and most importantly broaden the investor target reach or visibility the scf movement is less about blazing a new trail in new unchartered waters of finance but rather a shift towards utilizing technology platforms to make the existing process available to a wider audience less friction for all those involved as with the first wave of ecommerce the primary innovation will be simply expanding the potential audience for a given productoffering no longer will deal access be singularly controlled by the few with deep rolodexes the company believes and data suggests that most modern governments will push regulation towards a structure mirroring an environment like that seen in the uk today or the us with the jobs act changes these changes coupled with technology platforms that span geographic boundaries will enable a truly global network of small business funding just like a us consumer can buy products from the uk via the internet investors will be able to see and access deals regardless of their geographic location   the business model utilizes a platform service or listing fee structure and does not contemplate a transaction or success fee component this may change as the regulatory environment evolves in the us and globally but for now a simple servicefee model has been established the company began generating revenue for its scf business unit during the quarter ended september          note summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation and principles of consolidation   the company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap the financial statements include the accounts of its wholly owned subsidiary brackin o’connor all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated   because the acquisition of brackin o’connor was treated as a reverse acquisition the financial statements of the company have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the acquisition from the beginning of the reported periods the equity exchange transaction has been accounted as a reverse merger and recapitalization of the company whereby brackin o’connor is deemed to be the accounting acquirer legal acquiree and the company to be the accounting acquiree legal acquirer  the basis of the assets liabilities and retained earnings of brackin o’connor has been carried over in the recapitalization and earnings per share have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse merger   going concern   the companys financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business the company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of  during the nine months ended september   and an accumulated deficit of  since inception the company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations   in order to continue as a going concern develop a reliable source of revenues and achieve a profitable level of operations the company will need among other things additional capital resources management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through sales of common stock and or a debt financing however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes estimates are adjusted to reflect actual experience when necessary significant estimates and assumptions affect many items in the financial statements these include allowance for doubtful trade receivables asset impairments and contingencies and litigation significant estimates and assumptions are also used to establish the fair value and useful lives of depreciable tangible and certain intangible assets actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions and such results may affect income financial position or cash flows   cash and cash equivalents   cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less the company maintains its cash balances at creditworthy financial institutions that are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic up to  deposits with these banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits however these deposits typically may be redeemed upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk the company did not have any cash equivalents at september   or december          property plant and equipment   equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using straight line methods over the estimated useful lives of the related assets the company reviews the carrying value of longterm assets to be held and used when events and circumstances warrant such a review if the carrying value of a longlived asset is considered impaired a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved the cost of normal maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as incurred major overhaul that extends the useful life of existing assets is capitalized when equipment is retired or disposed the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the resulting profit or loss is recognized in income   impairment of longlived assets   the company has adopted accounting standards codification subtopic  property plant and equipment asc  asc  requires that longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the company evaluates its longlived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions recurring losses or a forecasted inability to achieve breakeven operating results over an extended period the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows should impairment in value be indicated the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset asc  also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell the company performed an annual review for impairment and none existed as of december     revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the company’s current revenue stream consists of chauffeured vehicle services such revenue is recognized when the services are performed   revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the fees to be paid by the customer are fixed or determinable collection of the fees is probable delivery of the service and or product has occurred and no other significant obligations on the part of the company remain   revenue received from transportation customers consists of payments via credit cards checks and cash and is deposited into the company’s bank account when received either directly or through the company’s merchant account   stock based compensation   the company accounts for stockbased employee compensation arrangements using the fair value method in accordance with the accounting provisions relating to sharebased payments “codification topic ”  the company accounts for the stock options issued to nonemployees in accordance with these provisions stock options are valued using a blackscholes options pricing model which requires estimates such as expected term discount rate and stock volatility   issuance of shares for noncash consideration   the company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments to acquire goods andor services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance whichever is more reliably determinable the companys accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of standards issued by the fasb  the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendors performance is complete in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes under standards issued by the fasb under those standards deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax benefits or consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled a valuation allowance is provided for significant deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized through future operations        no provision for federal income taxes has been recorded due to the net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately  as of september   that will be offset against future taxable income  the available net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  will expire in various years through   no tax benefit has been reported in the financial statements because the company believes there is a  or greater chance the carry forwards will expire unused   fair value of financial instruments   the company’s financial instruments consist of cash accounts payable accrued liabilities and longterm debt the estimated fair value of cash accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the shortterm nature of these instruments the carrying value of longterm debt also approximates fair value since their terms are similar to those in the lending market for comparable loans with risks none of these instruments are held for trading purposes the company utilizes various types of financing to fund its business needs including convertible debt the company reviews its conversion features of securities issued as to whether they are freestanding or contain an embedded derivative and if so whether they are classified as a liability at each reporting period until the amount is settled and reclassified into equity with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings   recent accounting pronouncements   in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  comprehensive income topic  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications other comprehensive income includes gains and losses that are initially excluded from net income for an accounting period those gains and losses are later reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income the amendments in the asu do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements all of the information that this asu requires already is required to be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements under us gaap the new amendments will require an organization to      present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  but only if the item reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period and          crossreference to other disclosures currently required under us gaap for other reclassification items that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period this would be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income is initially transferred to a balance sheet account eg inventory for pensionrelated amounts instead of directly to income or expense   the amendments apply to all public and private companies that report items of other comprehensive income public companies are required to comply with these amendments for all reporting periods interim and annual the amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after december   for public companies early adoption is permitted the adoption of asu no  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations   in january  the fasb issued asu no  balance sheet topic  clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which clarifies which instruments and transactions are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements originally established by asu  the new asu addresses preparer concerns that the scope of the disclosure requirements under asu  was overly broad and imposed unintended costs that were not commensurate with estimated benefits to financial statement users in choosing to narrow the scope of the offsetting disclosures the board determined that it could make them more operable and cost effective for preparers while still giving financial statement users sufficient information to analyze the most significant presentation differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and those prepared under ifrss like asu  the amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after january   the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations        in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb

and corrections related to fasb accounting standards update  sec update” in accounting standards update no  this update amends various sec paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of sab no  the adoption of asu  did not impact the companys results of operations or financial condition   in july  the fasb issued asu  “intangibles  goodwill and other topic  testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment” in accounting standards update no  this update amends asu  intangibles  goodwill and other topic  testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment and permits an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with subtopic  intangibles  goodwill and other  general intangibles other than goodwill the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   early adoption is permitted including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before july   if a public entity’s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or for nonpublic entities have not yet been made available for issuance the adoption of asu  did not impact the companys results of operations or financial condition   in december  the fasb issued asu  “deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income” in accounting standards update no  this update defers the requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income in both the statement of income where net income is presented and the statement where other comprehensive income is presented the adoption of asu  did not impact the companys results of operations or financial condition   in december  the fasb issued asu no  “balance sheet disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities” “asu ” this update requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position the objective of this

affecting the company   securities crowdfunding   during the quarter ended september   the company began the development of a new business unit to support securities crowdfunding scf activities as part of this new business unit the company developed a scf platform and the business operations for supporting the company’s entrée into this new market the company’s scf platform includes an exchange for the trading of crowdfunded securities ie a second market for crowdfunded shares a front end issuer and investor scf portal for facilitating scf transactions and a us based broker dealer “bd” centric deal management and compliance platform for bd white labeling and syndication        the scf industry is growing at a rapid pace and with regulatory changes promises to significantly enhance the access by lower middle market “lmm” companies to financing and investor access to private placements   the company has developed the scf platform for use by the following   · issuers who have sold securities via crowdfunding platforms · investors who have purchased securities via crowdfunding platforms · licensed financial entities such as other finra member registered broker dealers   scf in its simplest terms is a global movement towards broadening the investor base in small businesses by lowering accreditation standards of investors and changing the rules around the marketing of investment opportunities steven case the former aol exec often quips that “an average middle class person can go to vegas and gamble away  but that same person can’t invest  in facebook before its public” the scf movement seeks to change this paradigm   reports have been published that suggest fund raising through crowdfunding mechanisms will grow from the current b mark in  to over b in just the us alone in essence this suggests that the fundamental mechanism or process through which angel and seed funding will occur will be through technologyassisted scf platforms these platforms standardize the process make it more transparent for both investors and entrepreneurs and most importantly broaden the investor target reach or visibility the scf movement is less about blazing a new trail in new unchartered waters of finance but rather a shift towards utilizing technology platforms to make the existing process available to a wider audience less friction for all those involved as with the first wave of ecommerce the primary innovation will be simply expanding the potential audience for a given productoffering no longer will deal access be singularly controlled by the few with deep rolodexes   the company believes and data suggests that most modern governments will push regulation towards a structure mirroring an environment like that seen in the uk today or the us with the jobs act changes these changes coupled with technology platforms that span geographic boundaries will enable a truly global network of small business funding just like a us consumer can buy products from the uk via the internet investors will be able to see and access deals regardless of their geographic location   the business model utilizes a platform service or listing fee structure and does not contemplate a transaction or success fee component this may change as the regulatory environment evolves in the us and globally but for now a simple servicefee model has been established the

company entered into convertible note purchase agreements with six accredited investors for the purchase and sale by the company of  of its  senior secured convertible promissory notes due december   “convertible notes ” the convertible notes issued on june   constitute the senior indebtedness of the company the company and investors agreed that no indebtedness senior to the convertible notes may

as of september   the company had  in convertible notes outstanding   our current funding is sufficient to continue our operations for the remainder of the fiscal year ending december   however we will require additional debt andor equity financing to continue our operation beyond december   we cannot provide any assurances that additional financing will be available to us or if available may not be available on acceptable terms   if we are unable to obtain adequate capital we could be forced to cease or delay development of our operations sell assets or our business may fail in each such case the holders of our common stock would lose all or most of their investment please see “risk factors” for information regarding the risks related to our financial condition   inflation risk   we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations however if our costs such as gasoline were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could harm our business financial condition and results of operations        off balance sheet arrangements   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations liquidity or capital expenditures   capital resources and requirements   our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors including   · the extent and duration of future operating income · the level and timing of future sales and expenditures · working capital required to support our growth · investment capital for transportation vehicles and equipment · our sales and marketing programs · investment capital for potential acquisitions · competition and · market developments   critical accounting policies and estimates   we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period our management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates   the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements   impairment of longlived assets   the company adopted accounting standards codification subtopic  property plant and equipment asc  asc  requires that longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the company evaluates its longlived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions recurring losses or a forecasted inability to achieve breakeven operating results over an extended period the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows should impairment in value be indicated the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset asc  also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell the company performed an annual review for impairment and none existed as of december     issuance of shares for noncash consideration   the company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments to acquire goods andor services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance whichever is more reliably determinable the companys accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of standards issued by the fasb  the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendors performance is complete in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement        recently issued accounting pronouncements   in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  comprehensive income topic  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications other comprehensive income includes gains and losses that are initially excluded from net income for an accounting period those gains and losses are later reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income the amendments in the asu do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements all of the information that this asu requires already is required to be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements under us gaap the new amendments will require an organization to    present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  but only if the item reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period and    crossreference to other disclosures currently required under us gaap for other reclassification items that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period this would be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income is initially transferred to a balance sheet account eg inventory for pensionrelated amounts instead of directly to income or expense   the amendments apply to all public and private companies that report items of other comprehensive income public companies are required to comply with these amendments for all reporting periods interim and annual the amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after december   for public companies early adoption is permitted the adoption of asu no  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations   in january  the fasb issued asu no  balance sheet topic  clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which clarifies which instruments and transactions are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements originally established by asu  the new asu addresses preparer concerns that the scope of the disclosure requirements under asu  was overly broad and imposed unintended costs that were not commensurate with estimated benefits to financial statement users in choosing to narrow the scope of the offsetting disclosures the board determined that it could make them more operable and cost effective for preparers while still giving financial statement users sufficient information to analyze the most significant presentation differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and those prepared under ifrss like asu  the amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after january   the adoption of asu  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations   in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  “technical corrections and improvements” in accounting standards update no  the amendments in this update cover a wide range of topics in the accounting standards codification these amendments include technical corrections and improvements to the accounting standards codification and conforming amendments related to fair value measurements the amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after december   the adoption of asu  did not impact the companys results of operations or financial condition   in august  the fasb issued asu  “technical amendments and corrections to sec sections amendments to sec paragraphs pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin sab no  technical amendments pursuant to sec release no  and corrections related to fasb accounting standards update  sec update” in accounting standards update no  this update amends various sec paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of sab no  the adoption of asu  did not impact the companys results of operations or financial condition          in july  the fasb issued asu  “intangibles  goodwill and other topic  testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment” in accounting standards update no  this update amends asu  intangibles  goodwill and other topic  testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment and permits an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with subtopic  intangibles  goodwill and other  general intangibles other than goodwill the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   early adoption is permitted including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before july   if a public entity’s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or for nonpublic entities have not yet been made available for issuance the adoption of asu  did not impact the companys results of operations or financial condition   in december  the fasb issued asu  “deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income” in accounting standards update no  this update defers the requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income in both the statement of income where net income is presented and the statement where other comprehensive income is presented the adoption of asu  did not impact the companys results of operations or financial condition   in december  the fasb issued asu no  “balance sheet disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities” “asu ” this update requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position the objective of this disclosure is to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of us gaap and those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of ifrs the amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods the adoption of asu no  did not impact the companys

information required by this item of form q   item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and our principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of september   the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules ae and

controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september   and this assessment identified certain material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting including material weaknesses due to our management’s lack of segregation of duties in financial transactions or reporting as a result of the fact that we only have two officers due to our size and nature segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible however to the extent possible the initiation of transactions the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness          based on that evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of september     changes in internal control over financial reporting   there was no change
