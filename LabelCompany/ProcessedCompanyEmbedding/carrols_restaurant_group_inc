symington tmfsymington mar   at am carrols restaurant group inc  nasdaqtast announced reasonably solid fourthquarter  results thursday morning but shares of the countrys largest burger king franchisee fell  as the market chewed on the news lets take a closer look at what drove carrols restaurant groups business as the year came to a close as well as what investors can expect from the company going forward image source burger king carrols restaurant group results the raw numbers metric q  q  yearoveryear growth restaurant sales  million  million  gaap net income  million  million  gaap earnings per share    data source carrols restaurant group inc  what happened with carrols restaurant group this quarter last years fourth quarter had an additional operating week which added an estimated  million to restaurant sales sales grew  on a comparable week basis the significant growth in reported net income was primarily due to a  million reversal of the valuation allowance previously established against net deferred income tax assets on an adjusted nongaap basis net income was  million or  per diluted share down from  million or  per share in the same yearago period  adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization was  million down from  million in last years fourth quarter the extra week in  contributed roughly  million to adjusted ebitda comparable restaurant sales on a week basis grew  on feb   carrols completed its acquisition of  additional burger king restaurants in and around cincinnati  on top of the  locations it acquired in all of   bringing its total burger king restaurants to  what management had to say according to carrols restaurant group ceo daniel accordino we were pleased to have been generally in line with our  outlook for restaurant sales comparable restaurant sales and adjusted ebitda especially when considering the highly competitive and promotional environment that existed throughout the year adjusted ebitda margin also improved for the year due primarily to lower commodity costs namely ground beef and from ongoing improvements to margins at our acquired restaurants we posted a solid  comparable restaurant sales increase for the fourth quarter on top of the prior year period increase of  burger kings promotional strategy continued to effectively focus on products that appeal to premium and valuedriven customers while driving increases in both customer traffic and average check looking forward  accordino also pointed out that after remodeling  locations and rebuilding or relocating eight restaurants last year more than  of carrols restaurants featured its refreshed  design image at the end of  in  however the company plans to scale back its remodeling efforts and total capital expenditures which should result in higher free cash flow that can be used for future strategic acquisitions and planned new restaurant development in the meantime carrols expects total restaurant sales in  to be in the range of  billion to  billion assuming comparablerestaurant sales growth of  to  trending toward the bottom line that should translate to adjusted ebitda of  million to  million carrols also expects to open seven to  new restaurants this year including two relocations while closing  to  existing restaurants to be fair those planned closures will almost certainly come from a pool of underperforming locations thereby improving carrols financial profile and with higher free cash flow potentially opening the door for new acquisitions  something todays difficult restaurant environment can provide at often attractive prices  carrols restaurant group could easily end next year with an even larger restaurant base carrols also enjoys significant builtin sales and profitdriving advantages given both its scale and the outperformance of the burger king brand relative to its other fastfood industry peers so while the markets initial tepid response to this report may not indicate as much i think longterm investors should be happy with where carrols restaurant group stands today steve symington has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends

decrease in comparable restaurant sales as we cycled past our strongest  quarterly comparison a  increase lower adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin reflected continuing pressure on wage rates modestly higher commodity costs along with increased promotions and discounting which accelerated over the course of the past year adjusted ebitda margin was further impacted by lower margins at the restaurants we have acquired fixed costs deleveraging from lower comparable restaurant sales along with the seasonable impact of lower average sales volumes” accordino continued “we expect that comparable restaurant sales should improve as comparisons ease for the balance of the year and as we gain traction from recent product launches and promotions in fact so far in the second quarter comparable restaurant sales are trending positively in the midsingle digit range we also expect to see greater traction as we progress with our integration of recent acquisitions including the  restaurants that we acquired in the cincinnati market in late february we have however modestly adjusted our  outlook after considering our first quarter results and anticipated cost trends for the

impairment and other lease charges and other income adjusted net income lossrepresents net income loss as adjusted to exclude impairment and other lease charges acquisition costs and other nonrecurring income or expense we are presenting adjusted ebitda restaurantlevel ebitda and adjusted net income loss because we believe that they provide a more meaningful comparison than ebitda and net income loss of the companys core business operating results as well as with those of other similar companies additionally we present restaurantlevel ebitda because it excludes the impact of general and administrative expenses and other income all of which are nonrecurring at the restaurant level management believes that adjusted ebitda restaurantlevel ebitda and adjusted net income loss when viewed with the companys results of operations in accordance with gaap and the accompanying reconciliations in the table above provide useful information about operating performance and periodoverperiod growth and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of the companys core business without regard to potential distortions additionally management believes that adjusted ebitda and restaurantlevel ebitda permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced however ebitda adjusted ebitda restaurantlevel ebitda and adjusted net income loss are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and accordingly should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss income loss from operations or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity also these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies the tables above provide reconciliations between net income loss and ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income loss and between income loss from operations and restaurantlevel ebitda b acquisition costs for the periods presented include primarily legal and professional fees incurred in connection with restaurant acquisitions which were included in general and administrative expense c the income tax effect related to the adjustments for impairment and other lease charges acquisition costs and gain on partial condemnation during the periods presented was calculated using an effective income tax rate of  d prior to the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a valuation allowance on all of its net deferred income tax assets this valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth quarter of  for comparability when presenting adjusted net income loss this adjustment reflects the benefit that would have been realized from deferred income tax assets during the three months ended april   if such valuation allowance on net deferred income tax assets had been reversed prior to  contacts
