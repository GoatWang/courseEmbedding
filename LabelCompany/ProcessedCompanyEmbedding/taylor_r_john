preparing to cosponsor legislation to regulate toxic chemicals in products designed and marketed to children    “in recent months we have heard several cases where toys baby bottles and other consumer products have been found to contain lead paint and other toxic substances” said taylor “our laws should protect these innocent victims by banning their sale and use in the commonwealth”   taylor’s action follows numerous discoveries of lead paint and other toxic substances in toys manufactured in china taiwan and other countries under contract with american companies companies such as mattel toys r us and many others have had to undergo recalls for tainted products and new discoveries continue to surface     “across the country state legislatures are stepping up to fill the void left by the inaction at the federal level” said taylor “to date  state legislatures have introduced proposals to address toxins in children’s toys and products”   the state of washington recently passed a comprehensive law regulating the use of toxins as it relates to children’s toys and products   california has banned phthalates a toxic substance added to plastics to increase its flexibility that has been linked with birth defects as well as defects in the liver and genitals phthalates is also banned in argentina japan mexico and the european union   “it is time for pennsylvania to act” said taylor  “i support a plan to introduce legislation that will ban the sale manufacture or distribution of children’s toys and products in the commonwealth that contain certain chemical components that are known to be harmful to children this is an important health and safety measure and i want to put manufacturers of these products on notice that the safety of pennsylvania children is not negotiable”   the consumer product safety commission has a listing of recalled consumer products including toys and children’s products on its web site at httpwwwcpscgovcpscpubprerelprerelhtml   rep

caroline paperback version click here to enjoy a free chapter from mike church’s john taylor  – american statesman book why assemble a biography of an obscure th century virginian who never earned the title “founding father”  chiefly because there has not been an attempt to paint a lifelong picture of our subject predominantly using his own short form works even if this  task were successfully undertaken there remains another reason john taylor doesn’t appear on liz cheney’s radar he has a reputation of being very difficult to read john randolph of roanoke is said to have quipped “taylor’s writing is profound now if we can just translate it into english” the purpose of this collection is to demolish that argument one tool to use in this quest is to read taylor’s work as satire aimed at the principal target of his work federalists taylor spent a career proving the antifederalists of the ’s correct and the nationalists wrong sometimes hilariously now in john taylor – american statesman all americans can learn and be entertained by the works of this gifted leader of the republican school of political thought praise for “john taylor – american statesman”  with this new edition of selected john taylor works some never republished before mike church does the signal service of reminding us of the foremost jeffersonian publicist–and one of the early republic’s most principled politicians –kevin gutzman author james madison  the making of america “mike church has resurrected the ghosts of secession past by bringing to light both the great john taylor of caroline and the northerners who insisted the sections should part ways…in   taylor was the greatest political thinker of the early republic and a needed counterweight to the modern nationalist centralization hysteria of both mainstream political parties  every politically active american should know john taylor” –brion mcclanahan author the founding fathers guide to the constitution john taylor of caroline countyamerican statesman is not a history book it is an exciting biography  collection of works from the “brains of the operation” behind the political dynasty of the jeffersonian republicans john taylor this collection combines historically accurate biographies of john taylor of caroline with taylor’s own little known rare and  previously unpublished works from arguing against congress’s taxing power to a satire on big government under the constitution john tayloramerican statesman introduces new audiences to one of the great minds of the american revolution in john taylor you’ll learn… most people think the louisiana purchase was unconstitutional thanks to taylor’s senate speech defending the treaty on constitutional grounds that urban legend can be dispelled taylor was the first to argue against congress’s new “constitutional” taxing power before the supreme court in the “argument against the carriage tax” taylor rejected his lifelong friend james monroe’s friendship

prominent author wellknown for clear writing profound contribution to linguistic theory and behaviour will appeal across the cognitive sciences links to successful oup books by ray jackendoff and adele goldberg the mental corpus how language is represented in the mind john r taylor description this book presents a radical reconceptualization of the nature of linguistic knowledge john taylor challenges the conventional notion that a language can be understood in terms of the interaction of syntax with a lexicon the second listing the words and the first the rules for combining them he proposes instead that an individuals knowledge of a language can be thought of as a repository of memories of linguistic experience each encounter with the language he argues leaves a trace in our minds we record the forms of utterances the concepts and interpretations associated with them and the contexts in which they were heard or seen features of incoming language  a word a phrase a meaning a voice quality an interactional situation  resonate with items already stored similarities between stored items give rise to generalizations of varying degrees of certainty and precision which in turn are able to sanction new and innovative expressionsjohn taylor writes with conviction clarity and wit illustrating every stage of his argument with arresting examples his account makes a profound and original contribution to understanding the nature of language and the operations of the mind and brain his book will appeal in equal measure to linguists philosophers and cognitive scientists show

and music video earlier this month it was it official the former country singer has made the switch to fullblown pop starso what do her nashville contemporaries think about this crossover brad paisley finds it admirable he told e news thursday at iheartradios release party for his ninth studio album moonshine in the trunktaylor has this vision for who she wants to be going forward said the river bank singer he also praised his longtime pal for saying in a risky way i am going to evolve beyond what you know me for already video taylor swifts classic glam looks people are going to have to get used to it cause its not the taylor swift obviously that you knew he said because this is somebody—like she was talking about how she cut her hair and she is spending time in different cities more and becoming more of a product—and she is a world famous superstar now she is just not nashvilles and we just have to kind of get used to thatbrad  isnt worried about taylor  and her future in pop music people are going to love it he said referring to her musical transition its going to sell and it already is selling she has done a great job video taylor swift treats fans to hilarious shake it off outtakes as far as taylor calling out her haters literally in her current single all of us have the urge to do that and i respect her for doing that said brad i have that urge to do that as well because it gets old just taking it when youre in the public eyeit gets old to sort of take it and its very noble to not say anything but its hard he said it becomes a lot of fun to really steam now and again and challenge somebody who hates you because in the end its all very sort of unreal and not always accurateyou know the people who hate you he added they dont really hate you with the same amount of fervor as the people who love youmoonshine in the trunk was released on aug  and also features a duet with carrie underwood titled high life as well as a song called shattered glass which was inspired by none other than paisleys wife kimberly williamspaisley of nashville and father of the bride fameit applies to any living breathing women paisley said its a different kind of love song that its not about beauty and butterflies it about belief and the wiliness for a man to step aside and let a women achieve her dreams and thats something my wife helped inspire photos taylor swifts
