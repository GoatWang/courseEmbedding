on wednesday august  after market close our conference call is tentatively scheduled to be held at  am pacific time on thursday august  with that ill turn the call over to jerry – lenny sorry i cant read this one leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer thank you carol and good morning everyone this is lenny after the slow start to the second quarter we ended with a  increase in operating eps which exceeded our expectations and guidance the improvement was largely driven by healthy margins and cost controls along with some benefits from marktomarket adjustments and a lower tax rate we were especially pleased with the solid sales performance at qdoba company restaurants which was driven by traffic growth as well as with improvement in labor costs and margins at that brand as compared to the first quarter more on qdoba in a bit first i want to talk about our jack in the box brand where we continue to focus our efforts on delivering higher quality burgers drinks and breads which is what our consumer research identified in  was the top priority for our brand the first major quality change we made was the introduction of our buttery jack burgers in q of last year which contributed to our best samestore sales performance in more than  years and in quarter two of this year we upgraded nearly  core products in one of the biggest initiatives weve undertaken to improve quality our most frequent guests are noticing all the improvements were making over the past year weve seen a significant increase in top box scores are how our burgers drinks and fries taste on average a nearly  improvement this kind of response is key to driving higher levels of customer loyalty over the longterm in the shortterm we recognized the need to be more aggressive on the value front given the amount of competitive discounting activity were seeing midway through the most recent quarter we began promoting value price combos featuring our new improved burgers it is to increasing trial of those products we slowed the transaction decline weve been experiencing and our gaap to npd narrowed importantly the way we approach value enable the company and our franchisees to preserve margins in the quarter which remained above  we also focused on the breakfast day part in the quarter with a breakfast croissant value message and our new triple cheese and hash brown breakfast burrito the latest in our popular line of breakfast burritos encouragingly despite a lot of competitive promotional activity in the quarter and some continued weakness in the  to noon period sales were positive during the entire breakfast day part with mix reaching an alltime high of  looking ahead our promotional calendar will continue to balance both value and quality related messages with compelling new products now lets take a look at our qdoba brand second quarter sales were strong on top of difficult comparisons for the year ago quarter in the second quarter we reformulated our mexican gumbo and reintroduced these guests favorite as loaded tortilla soup with tv support in certain markets we positioned it as the perfect antidote to the doldrums of winter the promotion triggered a nice increase in product mix looking ahead were bringing back a seasonal favorite next week mango salsa over the summer expect us to encourage our guests take advantage of our new pricing structure enjoy the refreshing flavor of mango across our entire menu q also features two of the years biggest catering events cinco de mayo and graduations growing catering sales remains an important focus of ours so expect us to continue to message catering opportunities with our guests moving on to our restaurant facilities since last year weve been testing various design elements at new company locations more recently we added some franchise restaurants and remodels to the tests when were in kansas city in a few weeks – in a few days excuse me for our investor and analyst meeting well have a lot to talk about regarding the future look and feel of our restaurants i dont want to front run that discussion today but well also be very clear on how we plan to expand both brands and drive sustainable sales growth in the coming years additionally well be sharing our initiatives that are intended to deliver returns for our shareholders on that note ill turn the call over to jerry for a more detailed look at the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal  jerry jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you lenny good morning everyone after a slow start to the quarter with operating eps roughly flat after the first two months we finished with a  increase in operating earnings a number of items contributed to the beat including marktomarket adjustments of about  which resulted in a lower tax rate that benefited the quarter by about  there was also an annual adjustment to rent for certain markets that had been previously refranchised and based on their higher sales levels approximately  of the additional net rental income was recognized in the quarter in addition margins at both brands came in better than we anticipated despite additional promotional activity due in part to continued favorable commodity markets we also saw the benefit of good cost controls with more of an austerity mindset throughout the organization for jack in the box the  decrease in company samestore sales was comprised of pricing of  which was offset by a  decline in mix and a  decline in transactions as lenny mentioned midway through the quarter we got more aggressive on the value front with price point messages running in the majority of our markets despite the additional promotional activity jack in the box margins decreased by only  basis points compared to last year as favorable commodity cost largely offset the impact of minimum wage increases that went into effect in january and higher cost related to equipment upgrades for qdoba q company samestore sales increased  driven by transaction growth of  and catering which contributed  partially offset by a  decline in the average check in addition to the solid sales performance at qdoba we were pleased with the sequential improvement in margins compared to q as the labor staffing issues we talked about were largely addressed a greater number of new openings in the last two quarters affected margins but we remain pleased with the new store volumes we are experiencing through the first two quarters of the year weve opened  company qdoba restaurants versus three in the first two quarters of last year favorable commodity cost helped margins and we expect that to continue for the balance of the year we now expect commodity deflation of approximately  to  at jack in the box versus our prior guidance of  deflation we also expect deflation of roughly  at qdoba versus our prior guidance of approximately  given the annuitylike cash flows of our business model we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders we repurchased  million of stock during the quarter and now have a  million available under current board authorizations our outstanding shares decreased by more than  versus last years second quarter which will continue to contribute to our eps growth our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was  times here is our current thinking on guidance for other key items for the balance of the year our q sales guidance for jack in the box ranges from approximately down  to flat at company restaurants versus a  increase in the year ago quarter it is worth noting that franchise samestore sales which has less of an impact from houston are currently running at  quartertodate our q sales guidance for qdoba ranges from approximately down  to up  at company restaurants versus a  increase in the year ago quarter we lowered our full year samestore sales guidance for jack in the box company restaurants to flat to up  and for qdoba company restaurants to up  to  reflecting our performance through q and our outlook for q based on our lower samestore sales expectations offset in part by the marktomarket and rental income adjustments in q we continue to expect operating earnings per share to range from  to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  i will make one other note our guidance excludes the impact of any potential restructuring charges in  driven by our plans to increase jack in the box franchise ownership and reduce overhead costs that concludes my prepared remarks id like to turn the call back over to lenny leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer thank you jerry i just want to take a moment in light of the recent changes with tim casey leaving the organization and keith guilbault taking over as president i first want to recognize tim casey for his contribution in leading the qdoba brand over the past three years i think hes a great brand builder and he has really helped to reinvigorate that brand and we want to wish him well i also want to take an opportunity to welcome keith guilbault to the position keith i think brings a unique skill set and balance across many different disciplines starting with his operations background as regional vice president of operations and division vice president of operations initiatives for the jack in the box brand also spending time running the franchise group as vp of franchising also working as vp of marketing innovation and cmo of the jack in the box brand and then most recently chief operating officer for qdoba i think he brings a wealth of experience and a balanced approach that will help to lead this brand forward and i just want to wish him well and im looking forward to what he will do to write the next chapter for the qdoba brand so with that id like to turn the call over to kate and ask her to queue up for qa thank you questionandanswer session operator all right great  thank you thank you and our first question is from the line of brian bittner your line is open now brian j bittner  oppenheimer  co inc broker thank you thanks for taking the question question on your sales so far in the third quarter we know that the industry has been weak in april based on the industry data based on what a lot of competitors have said but is there a way to – i know you just told us what the franchise comps were but is there a way to quantify how your companyowned trends look at jack in the box outside of houston and look at qdoba outside of denver so far in the quarter jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer brian what i can tell you is when we look at the houston market for the company restaurants – by the way we have about  of our company units are in the houston market when we look at the weather impacted weeks and how thats impacting the overall total it looks like that is impacting the total comp by about  basis points during the first four weeks of the quarter and that would be compared to what normal trends were for the houston market we had a couple of weeks in the first four weeks here where houston was tracking down near the  range brian j bittner  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay and what about qdoba outside of the colorado denver region jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say less of an impact directly with denver as i would say the – its been a broader weather impact given the overall footprint with some late snowstorms and weather across the country brian j bittner  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay and just a followup what gives you guys the confidence on the implied fourth quarter comp guidance because that suggests that you have solidly positive comps in the fourth quarter whats driving that confidence leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer brian this is lenny first i would tell you that the lineup of new product introductions and promotions for the fourth quarter supported by media for both brands is going to be exceptional compared to what weve done in the first three quarters so thats given us a lot of confidence that we should have a strong fourth quarter were looking forward to seeing those things hit the marketplace brian j bittner  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay thank you operator okay thank you and our next question is from the line of andrew charles at cowen and company your line is open now andrew charles  cowen  co llc great thanks lenny just following up on that as we think about the balance of the year and menu opportunities at jack do you expect to see more lasting product upgrades as a continuation of the declaration of deliciousness which are presumably more beneficial to operations or more around the ltos such as the recent sourdough bacon ranch and new breakfast burritos leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer i think what youll see in the form of ltos is the continued push toward the declaration of deliciousness so i guess the way to say that is when you take a look at the type of products that we launch for example the buttery jack line thats the type of quality that you should expect to see in the ltos coming forward and that will be complemented by some aggressive value oriented promotion as well so we think it will be a nice onetwo punch andrew charles  cowen  co llc and i am just curious as well just given your california exposure about your perspectives on lower income consumer and what i would expect to be an outside benefit for jack from increased california minimum wage did you see california outperform the rest of the system as we looked at q jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer yes california did outperform most of the rest of the system andrew charles  cowen  co llc thank you operator okay thank you and our next question is from the line of joseph buckley of bank of america your line is open now joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch thank you can i ask a similar regional question about texas several companies and brands have called out some weakness in texas and ex the houston rains is texas lagging this system leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer i think the rains are probably the biggest current driver weve been paying close attention to this and we do see that california is outperforming texas but what were not seeing yet is any confirmation that texas has a major economic slowdown so were looking really at the most recent weather impact as the bigger contributor joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch okay and then kind of a broader question about value you made the adjustments midquarter we can back into what the jack in the box comp was for the last eight weeks of the quarter but did you see sales get better as the quarter progressed do you think the value messaging you have done so far is gaining some traction or do you need to do more leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer i think where we saw the biggest impact is we slowed down the negative trend on transactions thats probably the thing that were most concerned about so from a value perspective i think certainly wed love to see the top line sales and wed also like to see the transaction impact and that was what we think we achieved the back half of the quarter by putting those promotions in place i think going forward what well be looking to do is make sure that we have the right balance of premium ltos that helps to sustain the margins and the average check while we have the aggressive promotions – site promotions in there that help to allay any of the erosion of the transaction joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch okay thank you operator okay thank you and our next question is from the line of david tarantino of robert w baird your line is open now david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc broker hi good morning lenny just a quick followup to that last comment i was wondering if you think youre satisfied with the impact of the promotional approach that you are using on the value side or if you think you need to be any more aggressive in terms of whether its the discount or price point that you are offering as you move into the rest of this year and into next year leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think if you pay attention to our twoyear comparisons it was strongest in the last period and thats probably the best indication of how well those value promotions are working for us and taking a balanced approach to holding onto some margin while also driving some transaction and sales so its a competitive marketplace were trying to walk the fine line both profitability and sales it seems like theres a lot of aggressive activity out there that is willing to sacrifice a lot of the margin were trying to make a balanced approach on our end that retain some of the gains that weve had in this premium positioning while at the same time make sure that were being competitive in the marketplace and not just allowing the bottom side of our menu – the value side of our menu to completely erode david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc broker great that makes sense and jerry i was wondering if you could help us – i think it was helpful that the components you gave on the upside for q but you mentioned a couple of factors margins came in better than anticipated and you had some good cost controls so i was wondering if you can elaborate on what the drivers of those are and whether you think you are able to continue those as you look into the next couple of quarters jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah a couple of things so one on the margins the promotional activity at both brands actually saw improving sales but was really good flowthrough on those sales driven in part by i think just overall good expense control in the restaurant but also we were helped by the continued deflationary nature of the commodity markets and so – and you can see that reflected in our guidance as we continue to forecast commodity to be more deflationary and what we had in the prior quarter so i think thats part of that and i think youd expect to see that going forward the other i think is just related to some of the work that were doing with – that well talk about in much more detail when we see you guys at the investor and analyst day with our overall cost control so weve been – has been very visible throughout the organization and i think its just natural that with that conversation and the level of activity that were seeing here that youre going to have folks that are a bit more cost conscious than they might otherwise be and i think were seeing some of that flow through although i can tell you its very difficult to put your finger on exactly what that is and how much it is but it would be odd to not have that bleed through the numbers and i think thats also reflected in the guidance going forward david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc broker great thank you operator okay thank you and our next question is from the line of john glass of morgan stanley your line is open now john glass  morgan stanley  co llc thanks thanks very much jerry you alluded to the fact that you might see some costs of the restructuring and stuff coming through later this year or that the guidance was exclusive of that where are you maybe in that process i know you are going to give probably more detail in a few weeks but where – is some of this refranchising underway now is it reasonable to expect any refranchising transactions in the calendar year and can you get ahead of those with the ga cuts or those lagged  just by their nature of need to cut the stores first jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer so i wont give a lot of color on that what i will tell you is one we will give a lot of detail around that in what  days but the corporate level ga cuts are independent of the refranchising i dont think you need to do a refranchising to start all of the ga cuts john glass  morgan stanley  co llc okay thats helpful i guess and your guidance for the year this quarter had some – you mentioned some unexpected puts and takes is there anything else that is notable in your thinking about the current earnings guidance that we wouldnt see movement in the ga line or lack of assumptions in ga are there any underlying assumptions we need to know about now just to reconcile that with our own forecasts jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah let me see if i can make this answer a bit more helpful to you than what my last answer was john glass  morgan stanley  co llc thank you jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer so the way i would look at this just walking through the math john so were at  in q yeartodate eps if you just take the midpoint of our guidance call it  that implies  in the back half of the year rolling over  last year roughly a  increase the way i would look at this is when you look at the rd week impact which i think weve identified as being  a share previously then you look at the lower share count based upon what weve purchased offset a bit by some higher interest expense and lower sga which is primarily related to the ongoing lower pension expense and lower incentive compensation because this years performance isnt nearly as good as last years performance was that makes up about twothirds of that  increase the other onethird or roughly  of that earnings growth is related to sales and margin activities or the four walls of the restaurant if you will john glass  morgan stanley  co llc thank you you made good thank you operator okay thank you and our next question is from the line of keith siegner of ubs your line is open now keith r siegner  ubs securities llc thanks and jerry that was very helpful that last bit of clarity so i appreciate that as well switching gears a little bit if we think about some of the things we have learned through this earnings seasons right we have learned about loyalty programs kiosks mobile order and pay delivery tests basically all of the major mainstream quick service brands have a lot of tests in place and a lot of this were going to see even before year end at some of these big chains and i know i ask you this a lot but lenny if you could just give us an update about what tests do you have in place maybe just whats your philosophy about how you are thinking about these things just some form of update and again weve really learned so much about all the other brands this earnings season so just like to know the latest about you too thanks leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer so when you look at the list of potentially all things digital in delivery we understand that in order for us to be competitive going forward we will have to play in that space what weve been able to evaluate and get some information on is really this understanding of how much of that business is being led by the aggregators that are out there or the thirdparty folks that do digital for major organizations and how much of that is being done internally and what we see is there is going to be a pretty decent contest with the aggregators versus the internal investment either way what youre going to see is every major brand including us will play in that space whether we do it all ourselves or partially ourselves well be involved in everything from delivery to apps and digital applications that allow us to manage everything from crm programs to mobile payment i cant tell you that we have decided on the path forward as far as how much of that we want to handle internally versus how much of that we want to use the aggregators for but we have lined up several tests using both internal and external resources to sort that out within the coming years so our plan is to wade into that water pretty deeply and get a good understanding of the path forward and make a firm commitment to use that path so keith i know there is not a ton of detail there on all that well be doing specifically about the qdoba brand as ive talked about in the past is a little further ahead than the jack in the box brand we built an infrastructure for an app and a digital test there and we currently have that in test we know that there will be some learnings that come out of that we will be able to apply to the jack brand as well and i would say in the next six months to  months we should feel a lot more sure about where we want to place those investments and how we want to move forward but i dont feel like were behind and i feel like the information we have and the testing weve done is right on par with where everybody else is from the standpoint of understanding and figuring out how we move forward i dont think anybody has got it sorted out but i do think that everybodys making that commitment right now keith r siegner  ubs securities llc thats great thanks and then maybe just one followup to an earlier question you mentioned that product and promo for q is exceptional versus q to q which is really exciting considering that we had the declaration of delicious million burger giveaway  new product updates should i think of it as the q through q in total or is this even exciting compared to those promos and products leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer i really dont think that weve done anything in the first three quarters that was as exciting as what we expect to happen in the fourth quarter from a product perspective the core product improvements that we did earlier in the year i think have got an exceptional results from the standpoint of the consumer recognizing the quality improvement but i also recognize that thats not a new product and getting attention to that in a shortterm is harder to do so thats more of a longterm play and it really flew in the face of a lot of shortterm discounting that was going on out there in the fourth quarter i feel like we have both some exciting discounting and some exciting new premium products hitting and i think thats probably from a competitive environment standpoint going to stack up a little bit better keith r siegner  ubs securities llc thats great thank you very much operator okay thank you and our next question is from the line of chris ocull of keybanc your line is open chris ocull  keybanc capital markets inc thanks good morning guys my question relates to the revamped menu at jack lenny you mentioned that food quality scores have risen with the core guest but i am wondering if the changes have increased their likelihood to return or whether you have seen that score increase in the survey work leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer yeah great question you could be a fly on the wall to our consumer insights conversation and yes the likelihood to return has increased and we saw even in the original taste testing that we did that the likelihood to return would increase then we had to go prove it out by actually launching the product and were happy to report that were seeing that now in the real world so pretty pleased with that we think that the longterm ramifications for the core product improvements are positive and were looking forward to seeing all that well do chris ocull  keybanc capital markets inc okay and then – thats good to hear and then just a question on qdoba i mean the comps and the transactions clearly made a nice rebound but the profit dollars per store were flat to down it looks like yearoveryear is this a sacrifice the brand is intentionally making to build awareness and trial and if so how long do you plan to use this kind of promotional strategy at qdoba jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah chris im going to jump in and address this at least in the beginning here so if you look at the restaurants that are the nonnew restaurants those margins were actually up yearoveryear even with the additional promotional activity and thats where i was getting to earlier when i mentioned that the flowthrough on those promotional sales were actually quite good weve opened up over the last three quarters  new units which is  of our overall company store base for qdoba and so that is impacting the margins down a bit although the average unit volumes on an annualized basis are over  million in those new units and then if you look at the areas in which there would be a margin drag it would be the areas that you would expect a new restaurant to have a margin drag so they have a little higher labor which is shorterterm not longerterm so youd expect that to improve they have a little higher food cost because of just the extra waste again more of a learning standpoint and then youd expect that to go away the other piece thats driving a little higher operating cost is the depreciation because theyre all brand new restaurants and so theyre going to have a little higher depreciation on that but other than that the restaurants are performing very well and i would say other than the depreciation and perhaps a little occupancy cost youd expect these restaurants to begin to perform similarly to what the longerterm openings are chris ocull  keybanc capital markets inc thats helpful so the margin percent of the comparable base jerry then is it up yearoveryear with jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer it is its up its up a bit chris its not up a ton but it is up a little bit chris ocull  keybanc capital markets inc thats helpful thank you leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer chris you asked about the promotion strategy for qdoba and whether we were intentionally sacrificing margin i think that jerry addressed the margin information that you needed but i will from a strategic standpoint say that when we look back at q and what we learned as the jack in the box brand committed a lot of resources to roll out a core products improvement initiative that was one of the biggest initiatives weve had in years once we committed to that we were not able to pivot as quickly to the competitive activity that was in the marketplace and negatively impacted our results when we took a look at what was happening with one of our major competitors in the fresh mexican grill space we didnt want to have the promotional activities that we were seeing from that major competitor negatively impacting qdoba brand so in fact we did pivot and make sure that we had significant amount of promotional activity in the marketplace at this time and well stick with that strategy as long as the environment requires it chris ocull  keybanc capital markets inc okay thank you thats very helpful operator okay thank you and our next question is from the line of alex slagle of jefferies your line is open alexander russell slagle  jefferies llc thanks a question on the qdoba media strategy and if you can update us on the tv advertising tests sort of how they performed versus your expectations and how we should think about the strategy through the rest of the year leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so we tested tv alongside several other things and what we actually found is that some of the other things we were doing outside of television actually drove better results so although tv was a great way for us to bring attention to the brand and some of the innovation that was happening we didnt feel like after the test it was the best goforward strategy so were going to use other media type platforms online and also promotional activities intended to put offers in front of the consumers face very directly and well use those types of things to bring that messaging alive and essentially get food in peoples mouth that strategy seems to be playing well for us so were going to stay more on that side of the things versus television alexander russell slagle  jefferies llc okay and as a followup on the qdoba development the fact that you have already built a good bit of the potential  to  qdoba company stores expected this year and it sounds like those are not nontraditional just seemingly its a bit frontend loaded more than expected i mean is it merely that or is there some potential upside to your implied guidance for company owned builds this year jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer no id say it is a little frontend loaded but that was more by design not by surprise the  restaurants that i mentioned though was inclusive of late fourth quarter openings so weve actually opened up  restaurants this year versus three restaurants last year at this time and last years restaurants happened to be more backend loaded alexander russell slagle  jefferies llc thanks operator and our next question is from the line of jeffrey bernstein of barclays your line is open jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc great thank you very much two questions first maybe lenny on the broader category as was discussed earlier it seems like there are some easing trends in recent weeks im wondering whether you would say its fair to say you have seen that at both brands beyond the weather which was noted for both brands but just wondering if you would care to opine to what you attribute that to it does seem like the value push remains across the industry so perhaps it is something more macro but you have got a whole lot better data than we do so just wondering your opinion on the slowdown and then i had a followup leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer weve got a couple hypotheses on that but the one that seems to be playing out the most right now is the regional impacts that are driven by the weather there have been some questions as to whether or not something is impacting us here in the tax season but were not quite sure that thats a place we want to go yet i dont know that its completely clear that there is a softening thats happening outside of a regional impact were going to keep a close eye on it but at the end of the day the pieces that are very clear is that the industry continues in a deflationary commodities environment to be aggressive and were going to stay focused on those things that are pretty easy to see at this point in time and keeping a balanced mix of both promotional activity and new product introductions into the marketplace but im not so sure that there is anything were seeing jeff that has us in a place where we would say here is the right response to a softening in the industry or some longterm economic impact were just going to have to keep a close eye on it jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc got it and then just at the jack brand specifically i think you noted in the press release that the comp was lagging that quick service sample set by  bps which i guess was slightly worse than the  bps in fiscal q maybe thats – maybe just monthtomonth within the quarter things got meaningfully better perhaps i dont know if you would offer color on that but it seems like maybe you have stemmed the tide but im just wondering how you go about taking share or whether you think just the competition of both breakfast and with value is just proving more challenging in the nearterm so we shouldnt expect any meaningful reversal in that trend maybe that fourth quarter excitement you are talking about might do it but just wondering your outlook on being able to once again take share when the competitive pressures are so intense carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications yes jeff ill actually take that one if you look at the npd data for the quarter keep in mind our gaap last year this time was up  basis points so on a twoyear basis we clearly took a significant amount of share and based on our eight nine –  system comp so on a twoyear basis we took significant share as compared to the last quarter jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc and is the expectation that you would go back to taking share as we perhaps look out to fiscal  or again does competitive pressure just make it more difficult for anybody to be running away with meaningful share carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications yeah i dont have my crystal ball out today however i would say that we did see the gap narrow as we got more active on the promotional front in the back half of the quarter jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc got it thank you operator okay thank you and our next question is from the line of jeff farmer of wells fargo your line is open jeff d farmer  wells fargo securities llc thanks actually just following up on jeffs question and it was touched on earlier but just in terms of the samestore sales trends you are seeing from  to noon any color there i would assume it peaked several months ago but has it begun to moderate what are you seeing there leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer yes it has begun to moderate we can see that quartertoquarter additionally we had mentioned back when we reported first quarter results that the breakfast items that were being sold outside of that  to noon timeframe had taken a hit which we thought was largely due to the rollover from prior years promotions for jack in the box and it was certainly compounded though by the aggressive marketing of the breakfast all day promotion from one of our major competitors but as we move here into q and q we do see that the  to noon timeframe which is the timeframe we set was most impacted has waned and we also see that the impact outside of that timeframe has been negated so we feel pretty good about where we are right now we are able to isolate it to the  to noon timeframe and able to think about strategies that would help us to protect that timeframe and restore it going forward jeff d farmer  wells fargo securities llc thats helpful and then jerry i think the franchise revenue margin almost  in the quarter looks like according to my model the highest its been in five years or six years something along those lines so two questions do you expect to be able to hold on to that margin level and could we perhaps even see that margin level move higher as we get into fy  jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer okay so let me give you the quick answer on the  margin sustainable short answer is no at least not in the shortterm anyway let me give a little color around this rent adjustment and im going to try and make this brief and understandable i think im going to fail on both of those targets but this is somewhat technical and its all accounting when we sold the southeast markets we did analysis with outside real estate folks determined the rent that we should charge to those franchise operators it was determined that the rent that we were paying under our lease was above market rates of rent and so we decided to charge the franchisee in those markets market rates of rent because they were lower performing restaurants i mean one of them to be healthy in terms of cash flow so we basically created a rent subsidy not a technical term but thats pretty much what we did and we had to then set up a reserve and a core  liability for that which represented the subsidy for the entire lease term for all the restaurants in which we provided that subsidy but what we did also in those contracts with the franchisees we indicated that if sales improved the rent could go up and either reduce the subsidy or wipe out the subsidy completely and so we look at that on an annual basis which is what you saw on the second quarter good news is that we are seeing significant improvements in sales in many of those locations and in some of those markets which necessitated us to effectively reduce the amount of that liability or that subsidy and therefore we got a  million benefit in the quarter you wont expect to see any improvement or anything similar or even close to that in q and q and well look at it again next year and well adjust as appropriate but if it were me i wouldnt model anything for that adjustment because i dont know if that will go up or that will go down and if it does either i dont know how much its going to go up or down so – but it will be based upon sales performance in those markets its technical accounting were happy that we have the adjustment it is sales based again so that is the good news but it wouldnt be something i would rely on going forward jeff d farmer  wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator okay thank you and our next question is from the line of nick setyan of wedbush securities your line is open nick hello nick setyan  wedbush securities inc  questions and then i do have kind of a bigger question first what was the deflation i guess we have seen in q and q so should we think about maybe that food and packaging going – taking another step down in q and q how should we think about the cadence there carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications so in the press release we shared what the deflation was for each brand in the quarter nick setyan  wedbush securities inc yes carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications and if you look at that on a goforward basis obviously we increase our expected deflation numbers so in the quarter jack deflation was  i believe id say youre somewhere sort of in the same ranges of that  to  for the back half of the year nick setyan  wedbush securities inc got it and under occupancy and other we did see a big jump as a percent of sales yearoveryear at the jack in the box brand is that just deleverage on the comp or are there some kind of onetime items that will go away and we should see less of a headwind in the second half jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer no nick good question let me give you guys a little color on that we mentioned in the press release about equipment upgrades impacting margin so weve done a number of things in the jack in the box brand to improve the restaurants and technology and also equipment weve improved lighting across many of our restaurants to drive samestore sales growth in the late night hours weve also upgraded our pos hardware weve also completely installed the coke freestyle systems and weve upgraded our restaurant computer network systems which will both improve security but will also enable us to offer free wifi to all of our guests at all of our locations so the combination of all of those things adds about  basis points in costs about  basis points is depreciation of that nick setyan  wedbush securities inc got it thats great color thank you and then i guess the bigger question is since we saw the change over in the ad agency it does seem like there has been a little bit of an evolution in how jack as a character is portrayed and i guess how your – i dont know if is the right word is as memorable the commercials in terms of the kind of comedy thats used et cetera is there a way that you guys maybe have measured the impact of the newer commercials versus how impactful they were memorable they were in prior years or i guess what is the overall strategy of how this evolution or how you guys are thinking about the evolution of how you guys plan on portraying jack in the boxs brand leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer yeah good question good insights too nick we do monitor that constantly well talk about that at the analyst day we do have measurements that tell us when we need to make adjustments and i think in the marketplace youre already seeing some of the types of adjustments that we make based on the feedback that weve been given so we see what you see and just like any promotional period weve got to freshen the advertising periodically to keep it noticeable so you probably already noticed that jacks voice has come back his voice had taken a little bit of a hiatus and he was on a journey trying to discover new wonderful ingredients to help to declare this deliciousness and now hes back to talk about all the things that he has discovered so more to come on that nick setyan  wedbush securities inc great thank you operator okay thank you and our next question is from the line of matt difrisco of guggenheim securities your line is open matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc thank you i have one followup question and then an original one so just curious on the specific product items towards the end of the quarter and a lot of the comp focus and your trends and how you are doing versus your peers have been focused on sort of improving into the back half of the year or the implied improvement narrowing that gap with the peers i wonder the jumbo jack and the product there midmarch being launched is that now – can you give us some color on how much of the percentage of your menu that is or is that a driving force sort of the value and thats going to be the thing thats driving the narrowing of the gap and i guess – or should we start to see then the improvement also in the nonbreakfast day part comp wise and did you see that in the month of march and then i have a followup question or a real question on growth as well and development leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer yeah just to share why we featured the jumbo jack and several other products they were all associated with the core product improvements that weve made it wasnt any specific strategy to use one particular product to drive sales it was really promotional in nature to get the new food in peoples mouth so wouldnt want you to imply anything from that other than what it was it was just – because we were going to be on promotion and we had just improved a bunch of core products we didnt want to have promotions out there that werent featuring those products matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc but i meant more so the value bundle also towards midmarch there being launched is that representing a larger portion of your menu as it progresses and gains some notoriety and builds part of identifying with your brand leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer i guess id say thats probably in the shortterm yes but if you look at what jack in the box has done historically weve used value bundles just like the ones we just did when we needed to get aggressive in the marketplace with promotions i think probably whats changed today is that everybody has some form of a value bundle out there and so its not so unique to jack in the box but this – what you see us doing today is very much in line with what weve always done and the type of products that weve always done it with matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc great and then just a question on development you said in the press release here  jack in the box for the full year or for the full fiscal year primarily being franchised stores it looks like youve – is that a net number or a gross number because you have opened it looks like maybe two net and then five in total yeartodate so i was just curious – or in gross that seems like a big rampup in the back half of the year is that still a strong target the  or i guess if we have those coming that you must have some visibility around them if they are going to be done by september carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications yeah matt its carol ill take that question so yes youre right on its five gross stores and our guidance on openings is always gross and yes we have high visibility into the projected number of openings for the franchise and company restaurants for the balance of the year matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc so we should see those fees also flow through i guess in the third quarter primarily because that seems like when they will be opening carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications no third quarter or fourth quarter right matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc yep okay thank you carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications operator i think well – if you can prompt for additional questions operator okay thank you and our next question is from the line of matt mcginley from evercore your line is open matthew robert mcginley  evercore group llc hi thanks for taking my question i have a quick followup on the rental income benefit of  that you had i dont need you to get into all the accounting details of what happened but was that a benefit that helped the revenue line or was that a reduction on the cost side that you would have had in the quarter jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it benefited the cost side im not saying that makes logical sense but thats where were required to put it given the accounting rules matthew robert mcginley  evercore group llc okay leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer but it impacted net rental income okay so that was a reduction of the expense matthew robert mcginley  evercore group llc okay got it and then i have a followup on the qdoba comp in the quarter can you comment on that regional weakness that you saw out of the gate with qdoba in the third quarter was that just the same kind of houston type impact that you saw with jack in the box or was that something broader than that and then on the comment on the promotional activity in the quarter was that a timing issue or are you doing something incremental thats later in the quarter that you didnt do in the prior year leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer from the qdoba front it was broadbased impact it was really – its really based on late winter storms throughout the country more so than any particular region and we dont have stores in houston so its certainly wasnt based on that but  are in denver and you had a second part to your question if you dont mind matthew robert mcginley  evercore group llc yeah the second was on the promotional cadence in the quarter you said that it would be later in the quarter and that would accelerate the comps so im wondering if that is just a timing issue or if that is something incremental that you didnt do in the prior year jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer its the timing of the promotional activity in q versus where we are currently so lower promotional activity first four weeks well have that ramp up going forward matthew robert mcginley  evercore group llc okay all right thank you carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications operator i think we have time for operator thank you yes maam go ahead carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications yes i think we have time for one more question operator okay yes our next question is from the line of jake bartlett of suntrust robinson humphrey your line is open jake rowland bartlett  suntrust robinson humphrey inc hi thanks for taking the question my question was on your expectations for the promotional environment for the rest of the year do you expect it to remain as intense as it is now and just kind of wanted to dig into your confidence that consumers are going to be receptive to – it sounds like more the higher end ltos that you are going to be promoting in the fourth quarter that you feel good about leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so i think your first question on the competitive environment i fully expect it to stay as is and it potentially could get more aggressive just depending on whether or not some of the major competitors that have suffered some losses in sales most recently whether or not theyre seeing any type of resurgence if not i would expect them to continue to get even more aggressive than they are today so thats sort of a weekbyweek view of the marketplace that we have and in all of our promotional lineup we have contingency plans in place to pivot to more aggressive promotional activities if necessary if we see the marketplace try to get more aggressive than it is today so i think thats the first piece and the second part of your question which i wish i could recall at this time jake rowland bartlett  suntrust robinson humphrey inc it was really i think part of the same answer but just the confidence that you have that consumers are going to be receptive to more of a more premium or quality message by the fourth quarter it seems like they havent been as much yeartodate leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer here is the way i would look at that if were doing a premium message on a completely new product the odds of them being receptive are much higher than when we do a premium message on an existing product so where we feel the confidence is that when it comes to the discount oriented things that well do those are products that are familiar to people and they will instantly see the value when they see the comparison in the everyday price to the lto price when we look at the premium products that were putting in the marketplace theyll be completely new news to the consumer and we think that increases the likelihood of success there jake rowland bartlett  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and lastly real quick and i – forgive me if i missed it but if you could give what your pricing was the menu price increases for both concepts and i think its going to imply a negative mix at jack in the box i am wondering whether that – we should expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications yeah so the pricing for both brands i think weve said this on the call in jerrys comments the price for jack was  for the quarter and for qdoba it was  and yes we did have negative mix at both brands we dont talk about our forward pricing price enrolls in and out all the time and keep in mind we obviously had a minimum wage increases in california that we did take some pricing for jake rowland bartlett  suntrust robinson humphrey inc but it is fair to think that we assume that mix could possibly even get more negative given that you will have kind of a full quarter of the value bundle carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications it will really depend on what the activity is and whats the balance is on the other products that we are running jake rowland bartlett  suntrust robinson humphrey inc got it thank you very much carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications great thanks everyone for

to lenny leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer thank you carol and good morning everyone id like to use my time this morning to address what happened in the first quarter and discuss some of the broader strategic initiatives were pursuing to drive profitable sales growth and longterm brand loyalty at both jack in the box and qdoba lets start with jack in the box and why we werent as aggressive as we could have been in our pursuit to improve quality across a huge crosssection of our menu we focused our field operations and marketing teams on the launch of what we referred to as the declaration of delicious which we kicked off on super bowl sunday ill say more about that in a moment but the major takeaway is that we chose to focus on this effort and not to promote value deals to the same degree as quarter one last year although we stand behind our decision to invest in longterm quality improvements we paid the price in the quarter as we struggled to roll over last years two for  breakfast croissant promotion additionally we experienced the effects of both the heightened competitive focus on value and the impact of mcdonalds allday breakfast primarily between the hours of  am to noon in recent quarters including quarter one youve seen us move away from discounting and heavy promotion of our value offerings as we focused on improving the quality of our burgers drinks and fries were not willing to sacrifice profitability for the company or our franchisees by promoting lowmargin deals that are not sustainable but you can expect us to adjust the balance of value and qualityrelated messages in the future as we respond to the competitive environment moving past quarter one id like to discuss some of the longerterm strategic initiatives for the jack in the box brand extensive consumer research we conducted in fy  told us that consumers would reward us for serving better burgers and they have last year we hit a home run with our new buttery jack platform and were just now beginning to roll over some of the high sales numbers we saw when we introduced the first two burgers in that line our guests are recognizing us for upgrading the quality of our burgers according to our proprietary research when fiscal  got underway our operations teams began focusing on a major initiative that we believe will continue the upward trends weve seen in guest perceptions around quality and at the end of january when we launched the declaration of delicious initiative we improved the quality of  burgers sandwiches and breakfast items thats over  of the products in those three categories we knew this would be a huge undertaking but we believe well worth it as i stated earlier we introduced our declaration of delicious initiative during the super bowl and are now supporting it with a robust multimedia campaign new menu boards have been installed across our system to highlight improvements like our new toasted buttery bakery buns and other ingredients that signify freshness key to the initiative is driving trial recognizing that putting food in peoples mouth is the best way to convince customers that our burgers are better we announced on super bowl sunday and via social media that we were giving away up to  million burgers with no purchase required how confident are we that guests will notice a difference when we tested those upgraded products at more than  restaurants in two major markets we saw a twotoone preference for the new builds versus the previous one we believe these menu changes are right in line with our strategy of introducing higherquality more craveable food which we believe is the best way to drive profitable sales growth and brand loyalty to that end we are encouraged by the steady sequential improvement in twoyear sales trends weve seen in each of the first five periods of the year now lets take a look at the qdoba brand first quarter sales were strong on top of doubledigit comparisons although earnings were hampered by lower than expected margins and some nonrepetitive costs over the last two years weve been transitioning away from some of the more value and discount oriented deals that weve featured in the past to promotions more focused on freedom of choice and mouthwatering flavors last year we rolled out a new pricing structure and became the only major fast casual mexican brand that doesnt nickelanddime its guests by charging extra for things like our handsmashed guacamole or queso in  we expect to continue driving sales and transactions with a combination of great new products and enhanced communication a great example of that is the new knockout tacos platform we introduced in late october to promote knockout tacos we increased our advertising support which generated both trial and traffic growth also expect us to continue leveraging some of the existing equities that we have on our menu to create line extensions and ltos that we believe will further drive sales speaking of existing equities one of our most craveable items is mexican gumbo but that name has been a bit confusing to our guests so were reintroducing it this quarter as loaded tortilla soup a piping hot option that guests can load with their choice of meats rice beans and flavors like sour cream cheese queso and of course our handsmashed guacamole all loaded into a crunchy edible tortilla bowl we believe that the change in name freedom to add flavorful ingredients and the new edible tortilla bowl will be a much better presentation and product for our guests to enjoy as a continuation of the marketing test we mentioned to you last quarter we will further evaluate television advertising with the onair promotion of our loaded tortilla soup you can view the commercial by linking to the home page of qdobas website last year we began testing various design elements at new company restaurants and more recently at franchise locations weve also begun testing remodels that feature various components of the redesign we expect to finalize the restaurant designs this quarter and release them to the system the approved designs for both new construction and remodels will have multiple options think of them as a palette or kit of parts so that each restaurant can be unique yet still similar enough that the guests know its the same brand all of these initiatives are designed to increase sales traffic and the unit growth as we drive brand awareness before turning the call over to jerry i want to reiterate my disappointment in our performance for the first quarter and emphasize that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering results furthermore as we have discussed previously weve been evaluating various levers to enhance shareholder value at our may investor meeting in kansas city well discuss our longterm strategies to grow sales and expand both brands in the meantime we have made a couple of key decisions including plans to increase jack in the box franchise ownership to at least  and reduce ga to approximately  of consolidated systemwide sales were targeting completion of these initiatives over the next two years we will share more specifics at the meeting including the potential implications of these changes to our capital structure on that note ill turn the call over to jerry for a more detailed look at the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of  jerry jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you lenny and good morning operating eps was flat in q as margin expansion at jack in the box offset lower than expected sales at the brand while sales and traffic growth at qdoba were offset by lower than expected margins and some nonrepetitive costs for jack in the box the  increase in company samestore sales was comprised of mixed benefits of  and pricing of approximately  offset in part by a  decline in transactions transactions were most negative at the breakfast and lunch day parts driven by the rollover of the very successful two for  croissant promotion in the prior year as well as mcdonalds launch of allday breakfast in addition heightened competitive discounting in the latter part of the quarter hurt our results despite sales being below our expectations jack in the box restaurant margins increased by  basis points compared to last year offsetting the impact of sales that were lower than our expectations for qdoba q samestore sales increased  systemwide the  increase in company samestore sales included transaction growth of  a  decline in the average check and catering contributed  driven by  sales growth qdoba margins were negatively impacted in q by some labor staffing issues which we are addressing in addition a greater number of new openings in the last two quarters affected margins but we are pleased with the new store sales volumes we are experiencing favorable commodity costs helped margins and we expect that to continue for the balance of the year we now expect commodity deflation of approximately  at jack in the box versus our prior guidance of  inflation we also expect deflation of roughly  at qdoba versus our prior guidance of approximately  the biggest drivers of our improved outlook are lower beef and egg prices given the annuitylike cash flows our business model generates and the greater flexibility of our new credit facility we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders we repurchased  million of stock during the quarter and now have  million available under current board authorizations our outstanding shares decreased by more than  versus last years first quarter which will continue to contribute to our eps growth i think we covered the rest of the comparisons to last year in the press release so i wont repeat them here but heres our current thinking on guidance for other key items for the balance of the year our q sales guidance for jack in the box ranges from approximately down  to flat at company restaurants versus a  increase in the yearago quarter the low end of guidance for the second quarter reflects trends through the first four weeks compared to the same period of the prior year when sales growth exceeded  our q sales guidance for qdoba ranges from approximately flat to up  at company restaurants versus a  increase in the yearago quarter excluding the first week of the current quarter which was negatively impacted by weather and was down  sales trends are tracking at the low end of the guidance range compared to the first four weeks of the prior year when sales growth exceeded  the only changes we made to our fullyear guidance other than commodities were as follows we lowered our fullyear samestore sales guidance for jack in the box company restaurants to  to  and for qdoba company restaurants to  to  reflecting our performance in q and our outlook for q based on our lower samestore sales expectations offset in part by lower commodities and additional share repurchases we now expect operating earnings per share to range from  to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  we plan on providing updated longterm goals at the may investor and analyst meeting including the impact of our plan to increase jack in the box franchise ownership to at least  and our plan to reduce overhead down to  of systemwide sales that concludes our prepared remarks id now like to turn the call over to the operator to open it up for questions sean questionandanswer session operator thank you sir our first question is from joe buckley sir your lines open you may begin carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications hello joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch hi its joe buckley can you hear me carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications we can joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch hi sorry about that i had myself on mute i wanted to ask a question on the value front you mentioned the mismatch in the first quarter the negative mismatch how does it look for the balance of the year are you adjusting upward the value component of your message based on the current environment leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so joe first off just looking back on the first quarter when we gave guidance we were within the range and we did expect with some of the promotional activity at the end of the quarter that wed be able to stay there but what we saw happen was the competitive input environment just got even worse for us in the back half of the quarter and our promotions were not as aggressive as the prior year same quarter so that came back to bite us so as we look forward now through quarter two back half of quarter two and also into quarters three and four you can expect us to essentially get in that game a lot more aggressively we just dont have a choice with whats going on out there but at the same time that were doing that i also want folks to recognize that jack in the box has placed some big bets on the longterm play which is really investing in quality so were not going to back away from that while we play the discount game if we could have it our way it would be mostly a focus on quality but we wont be able to control that so were going to compete a little more aggressively here going forward but i do think its worth recognizing the twoyear trend that i mentioned in my script because at the end of the day we are seeing some favorable things associated with what were implementing strategically which is more of a longterm play but in the short term what the investors can bank on is that we will get significantly more aggressive on the discounting side to be competitive joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch was the coupon promotion with the new menu launch in your plans originally or was that somewhat of a reaction to the environment leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer i think what youd see is everything thats happened early in q was planned and the things that happened midq and at the end of q are reactionary joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch okay and just one more question how did you do with coupons did you see good redemption do you share the comps for the first four weeks but presumably that includes the effect of the coupons which would be some traffic without sales or traffic with side item sales only presumably leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so maybe jerry and i can both talk about this what i would say first off is that between the television ad and the social media work that our marketing teams did we generated a significant amount of interest in the million burger giveaway so we feel like from the standpoint of us cutting through the clutter of all the advertising out there we were very successful on that front and generated a significant amount of trial so from that standpoint we feel like it was a huge success and jerry can take you through some of the numbers jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah joe so the total redemptions as a percentage of weekly transactions since this was launched on super bowl sunday are  so a significant amount of the transactions are there what that did to the average check if you look at the redemptions which did not require a purchase along with it the average check on those redemptions was  versus the normal average check which would be about  so almost a  delta on that which certainly hurt samestore sales which is reflected in the lower guidance range of down  which is where were currently tracking but i think it drove exactly what we wanted it to do which is to put the new improved burgers in a lot of peoples mouths so i dont – you know were not disappointed with that at all now we want to see if they come back time and time again for the new improved burgers joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch okay thats helpful thank you operator thank you sir for the next question this is coming from the line of mr brian bittner your line is open you may begin brian j bittner  oppenheimer  co inc broker thanks thanks very much i know youll give us more context around the refranchising activity that you announced in may but will you be able to achieve this in a way where it is not a headwind to earnings and ebitda and secondarily to that when you talk about your new ga target does this assume just core ga reductions or is this also taking into account the advertising expenses that go away as you sell companyowned stores jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so brian let me give a little color and i dont really think i could talk about refranchising without talking about the ga so ill talk about them together the last part of your question first the ga reduction targets have nothing to do with the advertising that will shift over to the franchisees once we refranchise so this is just pure cost outside of advertising that we would plan to take out when you look at holistically the refranchising and the ga reduction along with share repurchases we would expect for that to be well accretive to operating eps well provide a bit more detail on the impact to ebitda be it somewhat negative or positive in the may meeting as a lot of that will be determined on exactly which restaurants we decide to sell and at what price and at what royalty rates and so some of that is yet to be determined but one of the things that we are looking at with the refranchising transactions is perhaps a little different than what we have done in the past is were looking to sell restaurants to either existing or new franchisees who have a willingness and ability and a wherewithal to be able to grow new units and we fully intend to include development agreements for new restaurant growth into these transactions which we werent very successful at doing in the prior tranches of refranchising and then clearly well look at geographic considerations and ga efficiencies there also brian j bittner  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer on the – let me just make one more comment about the ga piece is the ga that were targeting for every  basis points worth of reduced ga as a percent of systemwide sales its about  million or about  a share and i know i was reading a bunch of notes this morning that seemed to be perhaps a little confusion with perhaps how we communicated that yesterday so i wanted to just lay that out there directly these are significant reductions in our overall cost structure which the ga reductions by itself will obviously have a significant impact on eps going forward as well as ebitda going forward with respect to that brian j bittner  oppenheimer  co inc broker that makes sense and followingup on that why did your  eps guidance come down by such a small amount you had flat earnings in the first quarter lower sales trends going forward than youre expecting i would have expected it come down a little bit more is that all related to the lower commodity outlook or are you including some of these ga reductions and pulling them into  guidance jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer no great question and let me give a little clarity there so the fairly minor reduction in our guidance is fueled by a couple things one is our first half of the year in terms of our expectations werent perhaps as high as the street may have had in their expectations so i know we missed  versus the street consensus we didnt miss our budget by that amount so we headed a little toward the backend loaded anyway in large part because our last years fourth quarter was fairly soft in addition to that or i guess on the other side the other components of the improved margin or excuse me of the eps guidance are lower commodity costs the correction to what happened on the controllable aspects of the qdoba margin in q specifically around payroll and some other restaurantlevel controllables and then also share buybacks which we had in our plan which we plan to do a bit more of and obviously we are buying them at lower share prices than what we had originally initially intended to do so i think all those things considered are baked into the fairly modest reduction in eps guidance for the year brian j bittner  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay thanks operator thank you sir next question on queue coming from the line of mr david tarantino your lines open you may begin david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc broker hi good morning my questions on the refranchising strategy and i guess jerry i think the message that youve been giving over the past year or so is that selling additional jack in the box units would not be accretive to profitability and therefore wasnt interesting to you and now were hearing that youre planning to do it so i guess the question i have is what changed in your mind or what is the kind of philosophical difference between how youre looking at it today versus maybe how youve looked at it over the past year or so leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer hey david this is lenny and im sure jerry will have some feedback for you on that question but i just wanted to reiterate what we have been saying about the refranchising effort weve consistently said that we would refranchise additional restaurants if they would be accretive so when we evaluate what we can do all things considered including our ga the picture starts to get a lot brighter for us and potentially puts us in a place where our earnings going forward have a lot less volatility so if you look at this thing holistically it starts to look like a very very good thing for us to do jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer and then david when you look at say refranchising at the average unit volume that our company restaurants are currently achieving in the call it  to  level with  to  margins those probably would not be accretive but if you break our plus companyoperated units into some quartiles of performance and you look at those first two quartiles or the lowerperforming two quartiles there are restaurants in there particularly in that first quartile and half of the second quartile that get much more attractive for us to refranchise and then combined with the ga reductions that lenny described can make these things be accretive or certainly be much more close to accretive when you consider repurchasing some stock with the proceeds david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc broker got it thats helpful and then maybe a point of clarification on the ga reductions are those tied specifically to the refranchising effort in other words are there not ga savings that can be accomplished without the refranchising effort or are the two interconnected leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer david when we look at the refranchising effort and ga there are obviously some direct ga implications associated with refranchising however theres a significant amount of ga reductions that are actually targeted beyond what would be directly associated with refranchising so this really comes down to us looking at the corporate overhead as a major place where were going to have to bring down costs david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc broker got it thank you very much operator thank you sir next question on queue is coming from the line of mr chris ocull your lines open and you may begin chris ocull  keybanc capital markets inc thanks my question relates to refranchising jerry in the past you guys have really focused on the return analysis based on cash flows rather than earnings per share when you evaluate these transactions is it safe to assume that you still view free cash flow per share accretion as part of the metric when you decide whether to sell these stores to franchisees jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah chris theres no question about that we certainly have that as part of the consideration set and we have ongoing maintenance capex every year for these restaurants thatll go away and then any future remodels that would come in that would also go away with that so we would certainly expect these transactions to be free cash flow positive going forward chris ocull  keybanc capital markets inc and historically theyve been ebitda accretive if i remember right im just trying to figure out why this would not be accretive to ebitda or whats changed that could prevent it from being that jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah great question some of particularly chris the more recent locations were in the southeast and some of the much lower performing units so it was fairly easy to get those to be ebitda accretive these will be a bit more difficult to do that because theyre not performing at that level that some of those later transactions were but i think when we get through the full analysis and identify all of the packages of restaurants that we would assemble well have more information for you on that in the may meeting but were not targeting these things to be dilutive overall chris ocull  keybanc capital markets inc okay and then just one last one in the quarter sga was  of revenue im trying to figure out how do you get to the  to  target for the year jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer sure great question youre looking at qdobas advertising was about  million higher in this years quarter as they were rolling out some of the tv advertising they also had some direct mail out there so thats just the shift in that and then remember also we had marktomarket unfavorable compares of  compared to last year and it cost us  million within this year and then qdoba also had a brand conference that was in our budget for q this year that obviously will not continue going forward and that was about  that was in the ga those things will not continue going forward in fact the advertising timing will actually go the other way for us chris ocull  keybanc capital markets inc okay thanks operator thank you sir next question on queue is coming from the line of mr jeffrey bernstein your line is open you may begin jeffrey a bernstein  barclays capital inc great thank you very much two questions just one as we think about the comps going for the rest of the year for the core jack brand presumably were talking negative in the first half just trying to get maybe somewhat of a qualitative feel for your confidence in actually still achieving the  to  for fiscal  i say that when i reflect on the fact that youre still lapping the midsingle digit comps the rest of the year and then in terms of the factors that really hurt you thus far its still hard to tell how low on the qsr competitive discount is going to last its still kind of hard to see whether your breakfast business will take back the share with the promotion youre running and still early to read on the menu upgrades im just wondering what gives you the confidence to assume that the softness that ensued of late that you can reverse that in the back half of this year leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer jeff i think a couple of things one keep in mind weve got a pretty big franchise system and i think early in the year the franchise sentiment about our performance was quite good as compared to the competitors when you looked at their comps and as theyve seen some of the competitive activity start to impact them as well as we have with our company operations you have a greater appetite across the entire organization to be aggressive in the marketplace with the offers that we think will combat all the discounting thats going on so i think in the back half of the year you can expect more of that activity but the other side of it which is the bigger bet and this is where obviously we have some risk but its a risk we think is worth taking is that we have upgraded  items on the menu and made them significantly better than they were in fact twotoone liking for the consumer as compared to the old products and we do expect to get some traction with those products in the back half of the year so if you look at all that weve done in the first half of the year you can essentially bring the super bowl launch as sort of the kick off point and you can essentially see that february march and april we will do a lot to put food in peoples mouths whether through the million burger giveaway couponing or aggressive deals that well have throughout this quarter that again are focused on the products where weve improved quality we would expect as we get past that focus here that folks would have a much higher take rate on those products going forward and we would get some more traffic out of that so that combined with the aggressive discounting that well need to do to stay competitive is what gives us confidence jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer jeff one other item is that while we have been certainly disappointed with the q sales if you look at the core periods in q and the first four weeks in q we have seen a steady acceleration in our twoyear trends periodtoperiod here so i think that also gives us some comfort that we are heading in the right direction here jeffrey a bernstein  barclays capital inc understood and then just specific to breakfast i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about – and it seems like now this quarter youre going to do a promotion to presumably take back some lost share are you concerned that maybe some of the traffic doesnt come back because maybe consumers have found an alternative and therefore you wouldnt make back your full share or how do you think about that maybe you could size it up in terms of what your breakfast mix is or what the breakfast margin is just the risk that the consumer doesnt come back where are you most vulnerable leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer yeah good question and it gives me opportunity to talk about the day parts so breakfast and lunch day parts were down slightly but dinner snack and late night were all up and so when we look at this and sort of put into context what our major competitor is doing with breakfast all day and we look at the impact of that as compared to our own rollover of breakfast promotions yearoveryear in quarter one were more concerned with the rollover of our own breakfast promotion which primarily impacted our breakfast day part so when we put in context what the impact would be we think that we can isolate breakfast to being something that we owned the results for q we chose not to discount heavily and as a result we did a poor job of rolling over the success we saw in q of last year we dont attribute that to the competitive activity when we look at lunch particularly from the  to noon timeframe thats really the impact of the competitive activity on breakfast all day and there are multiple ways that we would approach that one is when we offer breakfast promotions as well as any other promotion on our menu those things are available all day regardless of whether they are breakfast or lunchdinner items as compared to the competitors who are doing a breakfast all day type promotion but you cannot get their other lunch and dinner products at breakfast so some of the ways that we combat this is that when we put things out there were able to get a fair share of sales outside of any day part with nontraditional items because theyre offered  jeffrey a bernstein  barclays capital inc understood thank you operator thank you sir next question on queue is coming from the line of mr alex slagle your line is open you may begin alexander russell slagle  jefferies llc thanks i was wondering if you could talk to the magnitude of the impact on jack in the box samestore sales in the first quarter and in the first four weeks of the second quarter from the three factors listed on the press release and to what degree any of these headwinds diminished during the second quarter leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer well i think let me just speak in general about whats happening with the competitive space on discounting we do see that some of the major competitors are rolling off of some of the heavily discounted lowmargin promotions that theyve had out there and theyre going to bigger bundles that are a little more attractive from the margin perspective were happy to see that that is much more in alignment with the types of things we put out in the marketplace and we think we can compete well there we dont think the heavy discounting of lowmargin items is sustainable although we took the hit in q strategically even if we were to combat that going forward it wouldnt be by copying the types of offers that theyre doing itll be bundling highquality food at a very competitive price point and then when you look at our promotional calendar it did have a lot of mismatches really up until this timeframe that going forward we dont think will be or have the magnitude of impact that its had so far so we think were not going to run into that type of situation and then as far as the breakfast all day i just spoke to that on the last question but i think the most important thing that folks need to understand is that we look at the rollovers of our prior year promotions as the leading factor to our sales performance in q and we look at the heavy discounting and the breakfast all day is really secondary to that those are things that we do have a lot of confidence that we can combat directly alexander russell slagle  jefferies llc got it thanks and a followup on the super bowl if you could kind of talk to the magnitude the impact on that related to the shift in timing for the super bowl this year versus last year and the tv media support carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications ill just say alex because the super bowl was a week later our promotion is a week later than the buttery jack so our first four weeks of this period have only one week of the burger launch with media behind it whereas last years quarter that weve been talking about had two weeks out of the four weeks alexander russell slagle  jefferies llc okay thanks operator thank you sir next question on queue is coming from line of mr keith siegner your lines open you may begin keith r siegner  ubs securities llc thank you i want to ask a question about the million burger giveaway and lenny you discussed how one of the main purposes of this was to get some trial going so people could get the taste of that new burger in their heads what about the opportunity to acquire customer data you know it seems like the other silver lining of this is you get this data maybe now you can use it as a marketing tool are you happy with the customer data you got through that i mean i just ask because i live in connecticut and i got the burger discount by only giving my phone number which surprised me a little bit are you happy with the customer data you acquired leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer yes we are and obviously the consumers had a choice to take it the easy way or give us more information but we collected quite a bit of information which we think will be extremely valuable to us going forward and that was one of the reasons why we set this thing up this way so that we did have an opportunity to collect that data keith r siegner  ubs securities llc and then just a question on qdoba quickly if i may the quarter obviously very good twoyear trends improved but it came at some expense you talked about advertising and launch supporting that trend the guidance for next quarter is a little bit of a decel and you know the product launch is still there but were going to back off a lot of the advertising and launch expenses how much of last quarters success do you attribute to the product launch itself meaning the advertising spend etcetera versus the product itself like how do we think about those trends as the year progresses thanks leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so i think one thing to recognize is that qdoba even though we ramp up and advertising spend qdoba is still a pretty small weight as compared to what some of the major competitors do in the advertising space so from our standpoint its and we have seen this pretty clearly in the past if the food doesnt ring true we dont see the results and so we feel pretty confident when we see the results because we dont look at the advertising as the driver the primary driver is the food itself so from that standpoint it gives us a lot of confidence that we now have a whole new line of products that can help carry us throughout the remainder of the year and its not just the onetime sort of flash in one particular quarter jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer and then keith we wont tell you what the mix is for competitive reasons but we were very happy with the mix of the knockout tacos and if memory serves correct it was better than what the test was keith r siegner  ubs securities llc okay thank you operator thank you sir next question on queue is coming from the line of mr jeff farmer your line is open you may begin jeff d farmer  wells fargo securities llc thank you it was touched on but given what could be a greater level of free cash flow with that  franchise mix do you expect your two to three times leverage target to move higher as well jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer thats a great question and we plan on addressing that at the may investor and analyst day meeting but at this point in time we havent assessed that yet jeff jeff d farmer  wells fargo securities llc okay ill take that and then just one more a lot of ga questions but ill offer one more so just further drilling down along the ga line im sure we could find it in the filings but what was the ga component of your sga number in  and what does your target for reducing that ga number to  of system sales imply on a pro forma basis and i know its going to be a ballpark number but anything would be helpful carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications so heres what ill say jeff the ga dollars last year exadvertising were  million and ga as a percent of systemwide sales was  last year jeff d farmer  wells fargo securities llc okay carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications so it depends on obviously what your systemwide sales assumptions are but as jerry said every  million of reduction is about  per share as we go forward jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer and first quarter we did get some pension reduction coming into  that we didnt have the benefit of last year so i think were currently tracking in the  range right now as far as ga as a percent of systemwide sales for q jeff d farmer  wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator thank you sir next question on queue this one is coming from the line of mr bob derrington your line is open you may begin bob m derrington  telsey advisory group llc yeah thank you my question lenny is around qdoba directionally i guess over the last two or three years it seems like development of the brand is a little bit slower than what had been talked about i guess several years ago im just wondering as you look at the business can you give us any kind of an update on your enthusiasm around the brand particularly as it certainly seems that some of the new elements of the concept look to be very attractive from a consumer standpoint but likely also increase the investment in the box can you give us a little bit of color on how you feel about that and directionally will we see development begin to pick up in future years or how should we think about that leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer ill answer the last part of your question first yeah we do expect development to pick up in future years the things that weve learned are basically as follows one we need to look at development – or remodels and putting these new elements in play in existing markets different from how we would approach it in completely new markets and thats really the thing that we need to work out to get to the place where we can accelerate new unit growth so ill give you a little more specifics on that in the existing market the focus is primarily going to be food within what is an existing platform for service and also in the existing markets there are some limitations about how much wed want to invest in those existing boxes to change the image but we need to do enough for them to be noticed when we get to new markets part of the reason for the delay is were testing some things that are far from what we do today in existing markets and i think our initial impression on the change or the amount of change or the magnitude of change was that it was going to be a little bit less i dont want to give away the things that were doing but we do have franchisees and company locations doing some things that are a far cry from the way we approached our existing businesses and those are where we think the biggest opportunities are going to come from for growth in new markets but we do have to test those things out so thats sort of the stage were in i think when we get into the may meeting well be able to share with folks more details on those things that were testing and how theyre working out so far and that i think will show everyone why were enthusiastic and confident in our ability to grow but the way that i would tell you to internalize it now is – if the magnitude of change on a scale of  to  was initially thought to be a  or  were looking at more of a  or  now in the way we might approach the changes in new markets to accelerate new growth bob m derrington  telsey advisory group llc one followup on that if i may as we look at the concept itself originally i think the discussion was around  company and franchise do you anticipate a change in that event more towards franchise possibly leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer were going to evaluate that over the next couple of months and well give you an update on that in may bob m derrington  telsey advisory group llc terrific thank you operator thank you sir the next question on queue this one is coming from the line of mr matthew difrisco your line is open you may begin matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc thank you i wonder if you could talk a little bit about any of the regional disparities that you might have seen between your two biggest states california and texas some of the data suggests that california was one of the stronger areas so i think youre coming in a little shy and then also your quartertodate guidance was a little bit of more than a surprise to us considering what california was trending at when you mention the industry and the gap versus the industry im assuming the industry number that youre referring to is a national number and not just purely the regional and then is there anything to read into that that those regions are impacting you versus that national average thank you carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications ill take the last one matt so the data we are comparing to in the press release is the npd qsr sandwich segment which is the entire nation and thats our historical number that weve continued to report on that front leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer so matt just something to think about here were  franchise but the number that we guide to is company operations so first were lapping  number on the company side currently and when you look at it through the lens of the question you asked really the way i interpret it is how healthy is the brand both regionally and across all of our markets and i think when you look at what were achieving in the biggest part of our business which is franchise today which does span across all the markets it gives us a reason to be confident in the plans that weve put in play so some of the higher volume sites that we run on the company side struggled to roll over some of the aggressive promotions more so than in our franchise markets but franchise was up  so i think thats probably a better indication seeing that its the lions share of our restaurants of how were doing across the markets and maybe that helps to give you some confidence in how the brand is resonating with the guests matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc well really what im asking is the industry is implied to be over  and even the franchisees did  so youre on a national basis that would imply to be losing share im wondering are we missing the point though are we comparing apples to apples is texas and california in your sku there is the industry growing in line with the national average so you are losing share or is the industry not growing at that pace in those regions so perhaps your share losses on a liketolike basis by region might not be as bad as the national average thats what im trying to decipher carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications right so heres what id say matt npd does not give us the regional data like knapptrack or some of the other indexes do we only have it in total for the  brands so i dont know how our regional results compare to those matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc do you have anything that would tell you that youre not being hurt that its not brand specific but its just the category or your peers within that texas or california regions are feeling that same trend carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications heres what id say we outperformed the industry for eight plus quarters by a pretty significant amount this was obviously the first quarter weve underperformed in quite a while for all the factors that weve talked about the aggressive discounting our own promotional rollovers and obviously we do have a higher breakfast mix than some of our other competitors out there matthew difrisco  guggenheim securities llc thats helpful thank you carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications next question operator thank you maam next question on queue coming from the line of nick setyan your line is open you may begin nick setyan  wedbush securities inc thanks for taking my question you guys mentioned a  delta in that last week with the burger giveaway i guess we can do some approximations to what that means but can you just tell us it would be really helpful what that impact was in the context of that negative  in the first four weeks in jack if you would have backed that out what would the comp be in the quartertodate period for jack jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer so heres what i can tell you i really didnt want to tell you this because you dont know when people come in with the free coupon whether they were going to come there or not you dont know whether this is incremental or not incremental so having said that so i do not know if this is incremental or not incremental but if the people who came in were buying a normal average check type of a purchase sales would have been  better but again let me just caveat that i dont know how much of these are incremental or theyre just traits so im not sure if what i just told you was very useful but its the data that we have nick setyan  wedbush securities inc what if we just take out that whole week in terms of the comparison from last year and this year jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer and the other thing is we have the week mismatch also nick but heres what i would say is part of the reason that we went to a wider range of guidance from a typical point or point range of a quarterly guidance to a point range on a quarterly guidance including the down  points is reflective of that week which we know had impact because we were giving burgers away nick setyan  wedbush securities inc got it okay then switching on qdoba your competitor is going to get a lot more competitive here to try to get some of that share back that they lost presumably so i guess we have the easier comparisons going forward on qdoba and we are doing flat on a  comparison here quartertodate but whats your thinking around all the different moving parts youve got the easier comparisons youve got a more competitive competitor perhaps youre opening out more stores so theres some more cannibalization youve got some remodels that potentially could benefit the second half if the timing is right can you just maybe walk through some of the different drivers the puts and takes of the qdoba comp for the rest of the year leonard a comma  chairman  chief executive officer so a couple things to think about when chipotle ran into some of their difficulties we didnt see an immediate change in our sales that would tell us that there was a direct impact and i think we shared that in previous communications and then more recently as theyve gotten more aggressive in the marketplace we also didnt see an impact that would tell us that that is having a direct impact now im sure there is some impact but its not to the degree that we are seeing a huge shift in our sales trends so i would say that the risks to our comps going forward would be some aggressive activity that we didnt foresee that did start to have an impact and obviously we cant predict that but what we can do is have our own aggressive promotions in the marketplace which is what we have set up anticipating that there would be this type of activity from our major competitor and we hope that that would cancel out any type of impact that we might see so thats probably the best we can do is anticipate it plan and put those promotions in place but we do have some confidence based on current trends that were not seeing an immediate shift in our own sales trends and then the other risk factor i think for qdoba is always weather because we do run into more severe weather in the markets where qdoba is dominant so there can be some week mismatches sometimes caused by weather we dont talk about that very often we know its there so it is a risk factor but allinall were feeling good about our trends carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate communications operator i think we have time for one more question operator yes maam we have a question on queue coming from the line of mr jake bartlett your line is open you may begin jake bartlett  suntrust robinson humphrey inc great thanks for taking the question a real quick clarification on the pace or the timing of the refranchising you mentioned over the next couple years but it was unclear to me whether that included  is this really a  and  program or initiative jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so its first of all the two years is two years from today and presumably there could be some activity in  i dont know if there will be or not well know more about that for the may conversation but at this point in time i cant answer the question any better than to say itll be within two years jake bartlett  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay so it sounds like the – i mean it doesnt look like the refranchising here are impacting your  guidance in terms of restaurantlevel margins or even ga as we model this should we put any in  is that what your guidance is contemplating or not jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer no none of the refranchising or the ga reductions are in the guidance i would say that these are our targets that we felt were meaningful and substantial enough that we wanted to communicate them to the investing public however we dont have enough detail of the impact of these to put them in guidance at this point in time either on the refranchising or on the ga but again we thought they were material enough  we wanted people to know since we had made decisions to move in that direction jake bartlett  suntrust robinson humphrey inc got it and a real quick question on qdoba i was also trying to see the negative mix i know youre lapping big mix last year but i believe that the knockout tacos should have been accretive to the mix is my impression what are the moving pieces that drove that mix was it discounting or couponing or something else that drove that negative mix and what should we expect going forward jerry p rebel  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so a couple things one is the mix last year was up  so on a twoyear basis were still up  so i think that probably had the biggest impact there was some level of trial to get the knockout tacos in peoples mouths also which had a little bit of an impact on the food cost we saw a modest increase in discounting but ill emphasize the word modest again and the other thing that were seeing is that – which we really view as a good thing because it is a competitive advantage is we are seeing a greater take rate on consumers adding the guac and the queso to their order which is hurting the overall mix a bit because were not getting credit for that sale piece that you normally would if they were ordering that separately but were happy to take that because thats exactly what we wanted to have happen with us offering that as part of the pricing structure that we have jake bartlett  suntrust robinson humphrey inc great thanks a lot carol a diraimo  vpinvestor relations  corporate
