disclosure of which is also incorporated herein by reference in its entiretybackground field of the inventionembodiments of the present invention are generally related to genetically modified microorganisms more specifically embodiments of the present invention relate to genetically modified microorganisms having the avian follistatin genome engineered therein to create a microorganism strain having the enhanced properties of follistatin description of the related arttremendous progress in the genetic engineering of microorganisms and in particular yeast has been achieved at the end of th century such achievements have included the complete genome sequence genomewide gene expression profiling and whole gene disruption strains of yeast among other achievements however despite such advances the commercial use of such geneticallymodified gm yeasts is still quite rarethe protein known as avian follistatin and in particular chicken follistatin has been identified as a very beneficial protein for human consumption as it pertains to the health of lean muscle tissue such benefits are described in part in commonly owned united states patent application publication no  the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety however like any product derivative of egg there are a variety of health concerns associated therewiththus there is a need for genetically modified microorganisms having the avian follistatin genome engineered therein to create a microorganism strain having the enhanced properties of follistatinsummaryembodiments of the present invention are generally related to genetically modified microorganisms more specifically embodiments of the present invention relate to genetically modified microorganisms having the avian follistatin genome engineered therein to create a microorganism strain having the enhanced properties of follistatinin accordance with one embodiment of the present invention a method of treating an individual with a muscle degenerative disease comprises administering an effective amount of avian follistatin wherein the avian follistatin is derived from a genetically modified microorganismdetailed descriptionit is understood that the embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the particular methodologies protocols and the like described herein as they may vary it is also to be understood the terminology used herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and not intended to limit the scope of the present invention unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skilled in the art to which this invention belongsas utilized herein the term “microorganism” is intended to be inclusive of any single cell or multicellular microscopic organism in particular the term microorganism shall include all of the prokaryotes namely the bacteria and archaea and various forms of eukaryotes comprising the protozoa fungi algae microscopic plants eg green algae and animals such as rotifers and planariansmany exemplary embodiments of the present invention pertain to yeast and in particular the species saccharomyces cerevisiae “s cerevisiae” which is common form of yeast used in baking winemaking and brewing s cerevisiae is often termed a model organism because it scores favorably on a number of criteria for example as a single celled organism s cerevisiae is small with a short generation time the ability to grow s cerevisiae as a haploid simplifies the creation of gene knockouts strains s cerevisiae can be transformed allowing for either the addition of new genes or deletion through homologous recombination and as a eukaryote s cerevisiae shares the complex internal cell structure of plants and animals without the high percentage of noncoding dna that can confound research in higher eukaryotes each of these attributes of s cerevisiae make it a suitable microorganism for embodiments of the present inventionit is well known that s cerevisiae was the first eukaryotic genome that was completely sequenced the genome is composed of about  base pairs and  genes compactly organized on  chromosomes however many researchers believe only about  of these are believed to be true functional genes given the amount of research and information available regarding yeast and various strains and species thereof identifying the proper locations to add andor delete genes within the strains to create a genetically modified microorganism as described hereinfor purposes of embodiments of the present invention any methods of genetically modifying microorganisms may be utilized to achieve the results desired with embodiments of the present invention accordingly any known method of genetically modifying microorganisms shall be acceptable for various embodiments herein and should be deemed incorporated by reference hereinin accordance with embodiments of the present invention microorganisms may be genetically modified to include the genome for avian follisatatin such that avian follistatin may be effectively grown within such microorganisms a detailed description of avian follistatin may be found within commonly owned us patent application ser no  the scope of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entiretyin one embodiment yeast may be utilized to facilitate the growth of avian follistatin by utilizing yeast the resulting modified yeast may be utilized in a manner similar to traditional yeast that is various food products such as bread pastries or other baked goods may be created having the avian follistatin protein thereinsimilarly various fermented beverages such as wine beer or liquor may be created also having the avian follistatin protein therein while certain measures may be implemented to preserve the integrity of the protein during the baking or fermenting process the resulting products will comprise an evenly distributed amount of the avian follistatin protein as opposed to adding the protein during the process which may create highly concentrated areas of the proteinonce such products comprising avian follistatin are created they may be consumed and yield substantially the same benefits as those described in us patent application ser no  the scope of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as such methods for treating an individual with a muscle degenerative condition may incorporated any number of the products described hereinwhile the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof it is also understood that various embodiments described herein may be utilized in combination with any other embodiment described without departing from the scope contained herein   previous patent active

cardiovascular disease in the future the life sciences report bob theres a lot on your plate these days how do you split your time robert hariri i am truly fortunate that my fulltime job currently is with celgene cellular therapeutics a subsidiary of celgene corp celgnasdaq but i am a multitasker and spend a significant amount of time on other pursuits ive been accused of being a bit of a workaholic i follow the elon musk ceo of spacex and tesla motors theory of management which says you can play a meaningful role leading multiple organizations as long as you are passionate and committed to their focuses and missions tlsr you are a neurosurgeon scientist and entrepreneur with active business interests but you were originally trained as an engineer did you enter medicine because you saw disease processes as engineering problems rh i have often thought about what skill sets served me best when i arrived at medical school yes the tactical problemsolving approaches that i was exposed to as an engineering student made me comfortable with a new complicated challenging intellectual venture like becoming a surgeon as my career developed i found my comfort level in identifying quantifying and distilling problems into their component parts and then developing a strategy to form a solution which is probably why i became so interested in surgery my engineering background is also the reason i look at everything as an opportunity to build a better mousetrap i still approach everything i do by fully identifying and characterizing the problem and then looking for a nearterm and longterm solution tlsr engineers are trained to solve problems without the prejudice of old thinking is that the way you approach innovation today rh i think so as an example one of my favorite things to show people is an application on my iphone using the integrated camera and light source by placing your finger across the lens you can literally detect whats called a photoplethysmogram which is the reflected spectral pattern that enables the detection of oxygenated hemoglobin volume coming into your tissue with each heartbeat i worked on developing this technology  years ago to measure blood flow to the brain and now its an application that allows you to measure your heartbeat and oxygen saturation using your smartphone thats what an engineering approach allows you to docreate a true innovation to raise the state of the art and the standard of care tlsr basic research costs lots of money and oftentimes does not look like it is directed to a specific application why do you think it is so difficult to get lawmakers to understand the value of basic research rh generally speaking lawmakers are faced with making judgments about issues they may have very limited backgrounds in it may be difficult for them to fully appreciate the value of discrete elements of discovery which enable applied scientific methods and engineering to reduce those discoveries to practical applications when lawmakers look at the life of the scientist and they see that exploration and discovery often yields information that doesnt have a clear use and path to commercialization they immediately discount that discovery process as frivolous in fact the researchers just havent been given the opportunity to connect the ideas between where discovery creates a point and a dot and how those points and dots might be linked to other discoveries that will yield tangible and quantifiable results to me the most obvious failure has been that the scientific community and the legislative community have not created a purposeful dialogue which i believe would highlight the tremendous intrinsic value of basic and applied researchnot simply because such research leads to new technologies but also because the technologies improve the human condition and fuel the economy when i look at anyone who believes that a solution to economic problems in american society today is to reduce investment in intellectual efforts like basic research i know that person is missing the big picture investments in research translate into the only legitimate path forward in solving both our economic and healthrelated problems the scientific community and the legislative community have not created a purposeful dialogue which i believe would highlight the tremendous intrinsic value of basic and applied research to provide a good illustration look at the effect of a revolutionary groundbreaking treatment for a lethal disease and what it has done for the economics of our society look at hiv it was a uniformly lethal disease that we now have effective antiretroviral medications for these medications have kept a lot of people alive about  of people diagnosed with hiv can be managed with that as a chronic illness the net effect of those  million lifeyears saved is somewhere in the neighborhood of  trillion contributed to gross domestic product i see biomedical innovation as being the best path toward controlling the high cost of healthcare fueling new job creation and reversing the trends that plague the global economy tlsr lets talk about some of the companies you have been part of you founded a business called anthrogenesis corp to leverage the potential of the placenta that company was acquired by celgene corp in  and is now called celgene cellular therapeutics cct what are your positions at cct rh i was the ceo ive stepped down from that role and ive assumed the founder and chairman position tlsr cct has placentaderived adherent cells currently in phase  development for diabetic foot ulcers in patients with peripheral artery disease these same cells also are in phase  development for crohns disease and i believe youve also done some clinical trials with these cells in rheumatoid arthritis and acute ischemic stroke why placentaderived cells as long as you are going the allogeneic route using cells harvested from same species but not the patient specifically why not use cells from marrow or nucleated cells from peripheral blood or adipose fat tissue rh when i first decided stem cells represented a platform technology that could revolutionize medicine i was challenged to come up with a product that could be easily deployed readily adoptable like a medicine and could integrate into the existing healthcare system where practitioners are most comfortable with traditional pharmaceuticals any technology that employs a living cellular product must meet very high standards of quality consistency dosability and all the metrics physicians are comfortable with in practice the placenta at the time seemed the best source of highquality reliable qualitycontrollable materials placental cells could be produced in sufficient quantities and with such consistency that physicians would be able to use them no differently than they use small molecules or biologic agents the unique thing about the placenta aside from the fact that its the richest source of stem and progenitor cells that we know of is that the raw material can be procured under tight qualitycontrol systems and with a high level of predictability it fits well into the manufacturing scheme thats necessary for economics of scale and quality control both are necessary for cell therapy to be a realistic clinical tool tlsr are these placentaderived cells immune privileged rh you have hit upon an important point the placenta is natures natural and perfect allograft its designed to be accepted across immunologic barriers when you think about it the placenta is tissue produced by a developing fetus that a mother will carry for nine months without initiating any kind of immune response there is no better example of that tolerability than in surrogate pregnancy where a female carries a fetus and placenta that arent even related to her yet she doesnt reject that placenta tlsr in fact the surrogate doesnt even have a haploid complement of chromosomes and their genes the fetus and placenta have a totally different genotype than the surrogate maternal host rh thats rightand the surrogate still accepts the allogeneic fetus and placenta as if its her own tissue that cant be done with other solid organs such as the liver kidney or heart the placenta is unique in that it can modify the host immune system and evade any host immune detection making it the perfect source material for deriving cells that can be used across immunologic barriers that was the premise behind our searching the placenta for these cells and it served as the basis for our product development and ultimately clinical development which has shown that allogeneic transplant is accepted without problems tlsr what about another administration of placentaderived cells to the same patient at a later time say after  or  weeks if were going to use the cells in a medical model like a drug can we give them again without creating anaphylactic shock rh one would assume that if there were even a small amount of immunogenicity associated with the cells with the initial administration a repeat administration would result in an amplified immunologic response weve shown this is not the case the placental cell can be administered serially without an individual host mounting any type of an immune response against it which validates the concept that the placenta is the perfect source of allogeneic material for transplant tlsr ccts pda cenplacell cells are administered via intravenous infusion the pda cells are injected into muscle in the diabetic foot ulcer indication how long does it take for the cells to clear the system of the recipient rh our genetic studies thus far suggest that the cells take up temporary residence and are biologically active for weeks to a few months in the recipient after a number of months theyre generally not detectable this sets it up nicely for serial or repeat dosing of the product tlsr weeks to months in the system implies a sustained therapeutic effect being a neurosurgeon and in the stem cell space you are obviously familiar with some of the experiments and clinical trials being done with adult stem cells derived from fetal tissue to treat lysosomal storage diseases one company involved in this area is stemcells inc stemnasdaq which has proved durable engraftment of neurons in the brain this was determined by genetic testing of samples taken at autopsy of some of the children treated i wonder if a durable engraftment model is possible with placentaderived cells rh i think that depending upon the situation longerterm survival of the cells is possible but i think that survival is dependent upon the physical environment into which the cells are introduced and whether conditions exist where the cells can take up temporary or permanent residence and become synthetically active i believe cellular therapy exerts its clinical effect in many ways a very important way is to become a source of factors that behave in an endocrine manner to alter the physiology of the recipient in some cases these effects are modulatory as in the case of controlling the immune system in autoimmune disease or trophic when factors help stimulate endogenous repair and regeneration investments in research translate into the only legitimate path forward in solving both our economic and healthrelated problems one thing we learned from the bone marrow transplant world is that when you administer mononuclear cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood into the recipient in a bone marrow transplant some of those cells actually remodel other organ systems years ago diane krause and neil theise at yale showed that recipients of bone marrow cell transplants actually had a large percentage of their livers repopulated and remodeled by donor cells even though those cells were administered specifically to remodel the bone marrow what that suggests is that when there is a venue for those cells to take up residence they can do so in a durable way tlsr bob you are also founder of a company called myos corp myosotcbb can you tell me about the company and its mission rh sure several years ago i became very interested in part because of my experience with stem cells in the fact that the quality and health of skeletal muscle as an organ system was vitally important to a patients ability to tolerate treatment for chronic diseases yet no one had devoted much effort to building a pharmaceutical biotherapeutic or bionutritional approach in that space i guess i was the inspiration for a small group to create a company that focused on muscle as an opportunity the founding team explored what was available to individuals looking to maximize the health and performance of their muscle tissue and realized there was room to develop a range of products in this emerging space all of us have close relationships with family and friends who are challenged with serious diseases like cancer or chronic neurologic disease it is very clear to me that the final common denominator in the physical decline associated with those illnesses is best characterized by the condition of frailty frailty is both a systemic decline in physical performance as well as loss of metabolic integrity and is characterized most evidently in the loss of lean muscle mass anything that could prevent or reverse that loss would be highly beneficial medically myos is a unique company that functions as a bionutrition and biotherapeutics business the company has a marketed naturally derived bionutrition product that significantly reduces the loss of healthy muscle tissue associated with aging the product will also augment the muscle gains of athletes such as those involved in resistance training tlsr the product is for use in patients with musclewasting diseases as well as muscle loss due to natural aging and for muscle enhancement for athletes is that right rh exactly whats interesting is that the objectives of these diverse populations are obviously different the athlete is looking to build muscle mass above and beyond the normal muscle distribution whereas the patient combating cancer or in the middle of rehabilitation from a neurologic illness is looking to maintain as well as increase the mass and quality of his or her muscle tissue but at the end of the day the mechanism behind augmenting that mass is similar tlsr my understanding of the technology platform at myos corp is that the company is developing myostatin inhibitors myostatin is also known as growth differentiation factor  gdf if you inhibit myostatin you can gain muscle mass is that it rh yes myostatin is a natural regulatory peptide that interferes with the signals that drive recruitment and proliferation of stem cells in muscle the function of myostatin is to balance muscle mass and skeletal integrity which was important in evolution to prevent muscle mass from becoming so unwieldy that it could exceed the structural integrity of bone the constant building of muscle tissue leads to contractile forces that can literally fracture bones and that sort of adverse consequence would be selected against by evolution this regulatory system is designed to keep those two anatomic systemsbone and musclein balance tlsr i found it interesting that some gene knockout mice have been created to not express myostatin and these animals develop double muscle mass there is a name for these mice isnt there rh they are called mighty mice also there are naturally myostatindeficient species like the belgian blue bull which develops tremendous muscle mass it appears the low myostatin state is associated with high lean body mass which confers certain physiologic advantages tlsr was the belgian blue bull developed via unnatural selection or was that a natural evolutionary process rh no one knows exactly how it arose however its assumed that a mutation expressed itself in a heavily muscled animal and the line has since been intentionally bred to retain that trait obviously domesticated cattle are prized for their total lean muscle mass so the belgian blue bull might have been unnaturally selected for its commercial value in other words the appearance of these mutants led to active selection tlsr bob im going to ask you an offthewall question i certainly understand that myostatin appears mainly in striatedthat which is voluntarymuscle and it does not appear in high concentrations in smooth or cardiac muscle however i understand that cardiomyocytes do contain low levels of myostatin im wondering if a myostatin inhibitor could be developed to assist patients who have heart failure rh that is a very interesting concept and is something a number of laboratories are looking at its very possible that an isoform of myostatin specific to cardiac muscle could be targeted for that purpose there is also the potential to use myostatin itself to prevent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy i see biomedical innovation as being the best path toward controlling healthcare costs fueling new job creation and reversing trends that plague the global economy these are not offthewall concepts i think theyre good to think about the science around the family of growth differentiation factors that control the process of muscle development is just now emerging and over the next several years i think great attention will be focused on this space i believe being able to control the developmental processes that lead to healthy tissue regeneration and renovation is going to be an important clinical tool in the future tlsr allow me go one step further with regard to heart failure im wondering about patients who may have had ischemic damage to the myocardium prior to a revascularization procedure while the thoracic surgeon is operating on the heart and grafting new vessels to it could he or she possibly infiltrate a myostatintype inhibitor into the myocardium around the newly grafted vessels which might revitalize the muscle with new growth and potentially new blood vessels have you thought about that rh its something we have to look at more carefully but is a very good point it could be a fruitful development focus for companies with expertise in myostatins tlsr what is the name of myos corps marketed product rh the ingredient is called fortetropin and its marketed under a couple of brand names myox is one of them cenegenics muscle formula is another tlsr since feb  right after myos corps  reverse stock split the stock is up  rh and we think theres a lot of value there the company is moving toward getting traded on an exchange its an unusual business model unlike the traditional therapeutics business which starts out with a scientific concept and then invests a considerable amount of money and time navigating toward commercialization and revenue myos has bifurcated its business its overthecounter dietary supplement product has been a revenue generator from the day that doors opened growing that line of business helps fuel and validate the business model around the companys therapeutics myos is going to leverage what it learns through deploying its dietary supplement product as a safe modulator of myostatin and use that knowhow to identify other approaches some of which will be traditional small molecules and biologics that can act on the important pathway i see myos as having a unique derisked approach to building its substantial therapeutics business while growing a very healthy and potentially blockbuster bionutrition franchise tlsr just one more question about myos in the athletic setting have there been any attempts to ban myostatin inhibitors as performanceenhancing products for athletes rh in the world of competitive sports no doubt there will be interest in any strategy that manipulates a regulatory protein the fact is that myostatin is a highly conserved by evolution natural regulator and has a number of naturally occurring protein inhibitors it may be very difficult to ban natural products that work in this space because youd literally be regulating what athletes can eat as food in some cases where do you draw the line on what is nutritional versus what is therapeutic tlsr bob did you want to talk about a private company youre involved with called human longevity inc private rh human longevity is an exciting and interesting business craig venter as you know is the pioneering scientist who was the first to sequence the human genome craig and i have been close friends and partners and we decided along with peter diamandis the founder of the xprize foundation and an incredibly accomplished leader in his own right to create a platform through which a broad scientific approach could be launched toward identifying factors associated with long lifespan using a very comprehensive set of genomic proteomic and metabolomic interrogation programs tlsr this sounds like a systems biology approach rh thats a great way of describing it the fact is that by using sophisticated genomic and proteomic tools we will identify actionable areas of the genome related to aging and come up with strategies to help arrest or delay the whole process tlsr thank you bob this has been very intriguing rh i enjoyed it too i thank you for your time dr robert j hariri is considered a visionary
