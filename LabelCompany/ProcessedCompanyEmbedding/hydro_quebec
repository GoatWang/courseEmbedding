was created to manage the companies quebec premier adélard godbout adopted a policy of investing  million dollars per year in rural electrification however in  the government changed and the new premier maurice duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas duplessis remained in power until  and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies and hydroquébec mostly served the montreal area major projects included bersimis generating station completed in   mw bersimis generating

while lowering residential power rates by half in the montreal area  the second nationalisationedit the spillway at the robertbourassa generating station can deal with a water flow twice as large as the saint lawrence river inaugurated in  the  mw generating station was at the heart of a network of  hydroelectric stations known as the james bay project duplessis conservative reign now known as the grande noirceur ended when he died in office in  the subsequent election of the quebec liberal party led by jean lesage marked the beginning of the quiet revolution a period of reform and modernisation the new government gave hydroquébec an exclusive mandate to develop new sites in  the government authorized it to acquire private electricity distributors including the gatineau power company and the shawinigan water  power company hydroquébec achieved provincewide scope all of the  rural coops accepted hydroquébec’s  buyout offer except saintjeanbaptistederouville which still exists major projects during this period included manicoutardes project a dam hydroelectric complex including the jeanlesage generating station  mw renélévesque generating station  mw and the

main transmission network as of  like its counterparts in the north american utility industry hydroquébec was reorganized in the late s to comply with electricity deregulation in the united states while still a vertically integrated company hydroquébec has created separate business units dealing with the generation transmission and distribution aspects of the business the transmission division transénergie was the first to be spun off in  in response to the us federal energy regulatory commissions publication of order  the restructuring was completed in the year  with the adoption of bill  which amended the act respecting the régie de lénergie to enact the functional separation of hydroquébecs various business units this functional separation and the creation of a socalled heritage pool french volume patrimonial of electricity echoed a recommendation of a merrill lynch study commissioned by the lucien bouchard government the january  report was aimed at finding a way to deregulate the electricity market in a way that was consistent with continental trends while maintaining the quebec social pact namely low uniform and stable rates across the province particularly in the residential sector legislation passed in  commits the generation division hydroquébec production to provide the distribution division hydroquébec distribution a yearly heritage pool of up to  twh of energy plus ancillary services—including an extra  twh for losses and a guaranteed peak capacity of  mw—at a set price of ¢ per kwh order in council  specifies quantities to be delivered for each of the  hourly intervals which vary from  to  mw hydroquébec distribution has to buy the remainder of the power and energy it needs—approximately  twh in  — by calling for tenders for longterm contracts open to all suppliers including hydroquébec production or targeted towards suppliers of a particular energy source like wind gas power biomass or small hydro for instance hydroquébec distribution launched calls for tenders in  and  for  and  mw of wind power respectively early deliveries started in  and the  wind farms under contract should be completely online by december  the transénergie and distribution divisions remain regulated by the régie de lénergie du québec quebec energy board an administrative tribunal established to set retail rates for electricity and natural gas for residential commercial and industrial service in the province based on a costofservice approach the régie also has extended powers including approval authority over every transmission and distributionrelated capital expenditure project exceeding c million approval of the terms of service and of longterm supply contracts dealing with customer complaints and the setting and enforcement of safety and reliability standards for the electric grid the generation division hydroquébec production is not subject to regulation by the régie however it must still submit every new construction project to a full environmental impact process including the release of extensive environmental studies the release of the studies are followed by a public hearing process conducted by the bureau

debt during the same period privatization debateedit the hydroquébec building is a landmark of montreals downtown in  the parti québécois government redefined hydroquébecs mission by modifying the terms of the social pact of  the government issued itself  shares worth c each and the amended statute stated that hydroquébec would now pay up to  of its net earnings in dividends this amendment to the hydroquébec act started an episodic debate on whether hydroquébec should be fully or partially privatized in recent years economist marcel boyer and businessman claude garcia—both associated with the conservative think tank the montreal economic institute—have often raised the issue claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debt without going as far as boyer and garcia mario dumont the head of the action démocratique du québec briefly discussed the possibility of selling a minority stake of hydroquébec during the  election campaign a léger marketing poll conducted in november  found that a majority of quebec respondents  were opposed to his proposal to sell  of the companys equity to quebec citizens and businesses while  were in favor commenting on the issue on guy a lepages talk show former pq premier jacques parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion adding that hydroquébec is often seen by quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride this could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention the liberal government has repeatedly stated that hydroquébec is not for sale like many other economists yvan allaire from montreals hautes études commerciales business school advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the governments annual dividend without resorting to privatization others like columnist bertrand tremblay of saguenays le quotidien claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when quebecs natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices for too long tremblay writes quebec was somewhat of a banana republic almost giving away its forestry and water resources in turn those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vultures leftwing academics such as uqams léopaul lauzon and gabriel saintemarie have claimed that privatization would be done at the expense of residential customers who would pay much higher rates they say that privatization would also be a betrayal of the social pact between the people and its government and that the province would be shortselling itself by divesting of a choice asset for a minimal

quebec uses the same  hertz frequency as the rest of north america its grid does not use the same phase as surrounding networks transénergie mainly relies on back to back hvdc converters to export or import electricity from other jurisdictions this feature of the quebec network allowed hydroquébec to remain unscathed during the northeast blackout of august   with the exception of  hydro plants on

the robertbourassa reservoir than it was before the flooding of the reservoir the increase of this population has been counterbalanced by a decline in the walleye stizostedion vitreum population the construction and operation of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities has environmental effects and hydroquébecs activities are no exception hydroelectric development affects the natural environment where facilities are built and on the people living in the area for instance the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers which works up the food chain it temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosion in addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilities since the early s hydroquébec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its operations the adoption of a quebec statute on environmental quality in  the cancellation of champigny project a planned pumped storage plant in the jacquescartier river valley in  and the james bay negotiations leading to the james bay and northern quebec agreement in  forced the company to reconsider its practices to address environmental concerns hydroquébec established an environmental protection committee in  and an environmental management unit in september  its mandate is to study and measure the environmental effects of the company prepare impact assessment and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities while conducting research projects in these areas in cooperation with the scientific community effects on the natural environmentedit the caribou population near major reservoirs in northern quebec has increased between  and  in the late s the company set up a network of  monitoring stations to measure the effects of the james bay project which provide a wealth of data on northern environments the first  years of studies in the james bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by  to  times over the first  to  years after the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after  to  years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a populations diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial

hydroelectric development project crees living on fort george island resettled to the new village on the left bank of la grande river in  another major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development specifically the innu of the north shore and the cree and inuit in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the james bay and northern quebec agreement some native communities particularly the crees have come to a point where they increasingly resemble the industrialized society of the south notes an hydroquébec report summarizing the research conducted in the area between  and  the report adds that a similar phenomenon was observed after the construction of roads and hydroelectric plants near isolated communities in northern canada and scandinavia however growing social problems and rising unemployment have followed the end of the large construction projects in the s the report concludes that future economic and social development in the area will largely depend on the desire for cooperation among the various players after the strong rejection of the suroît project and its subsequent cancellation in november  hydroquébec under the leadership of its new ceo thierry vandal reaffirmed hydroquébecs commitment towards energy efficiency hydropower and development of alternative energy since then hydroquébec regularly stresses three criteria for any new hydroelectric development undertaken by the company projects must be cost

budget residential customersedit electric heating accounts for more than half of the electricity used by residential customers in quebec according to hydroquébec the average consumption of residential and agricultural customers is relatively high at  kwh per year in  because of the widespread use of electricity as the main source of space  and water heating  hydroquébec estimates that heating accounts for more than one half of the electricity demand in the residential sector this preference for electric heating makes electricity demand more unpredictable but offers some environmental benefits despite quebecs very cold climate in winter greenhouse gases emissions in the residential sector accounted for only   mt co  eq of all emissions in quebec in  emissions from the residential sector in quebec fell by  between  and  residential use of electricity fluctuates from one year to another and is strongly correlated with the weather contrary to the trend in neighboring networks

consumption patterns of the current customer address and the average temperature in that location in  hydroquébec pulled out of a canadian government initiative to install smart meters across the province stating that it would be too costly to deliver real savings since then hydroquébec organized a year pilot project involving  customers in  cities with time of use metering a report filed with

governments – energy strategy large industrial users pay a lower rate than the domestic and commercial customers because of lower distribution costs in  the largest industrial users the rate l customers were paying an average of ¢kwh whereas companies with special contracts paid ¢kwh in  hydroquébec and the quebec government agreed to a series of controversial deals with aluminum giants alcan and alcoa these risk sharing contracts set the price of electricity based on a series of factors including aluminum world prices and the value of the canadian dollar those agreements are gradually being replaced by one based on published rates on may   the quebec government signed an agreement with alcan the agreement which is still in force despite the companys merger with rio tinto group renews the water rights concession on the saguenay and peribonka rivers in exchange alcan has agreed to invest in its quebec facilities and to maintain jobs and its corporate headquarters in

located in baiecomeau bécancour and deschambaultgrondines in addition the deal will allow alcoa to modernize the baiecomeau plant which will increase its production capacity by  tonnes a year to a total of  tonnes several economists including université lavals jeanthomas bernard and gérard bélanger have challenged the governments strategy and argue that sales to large industrial customers are very costly to the quebec economy in an article published in  the researchers estimate that under the current regime a job in a new aluminum smelter or an expansion project costs the province between c and c a year when taking into consideration the money that could be made by selling the excess electricity on the new york market this argument is disputed by large industrial customers who point out that data from  to  indicate that electricity exports prices get lower when quantities increase and vice versa we find that the more we export the less lucrative it gets said luc boulanger the head of the association representing quebecs large industrial customers in his opinion the high volatility of electricity markets and the transmission infrastructure physical limitations reduce the quantities of electricity that can be exported when prices are higher export marketsedit hydroquébec exports and brokerage activities in canada and the united states –           exports gwhnote

vermonts two largest utilities green mountain power and central vermont public service entered into a tentative year deal with hydroquébec to purchase up to  mw of hydro power from  to  the memorandum of understanding provides for a price smoothing mechanism shielding vermont customers from market price spikes the deal is contingent upon the enactment designating large hydro as renewable energy the

fortis inc a utility serving  customers in the cornwall ontario area the contract was renewed in  and will be in force until  the company has several advantages in its dealings in export markets first its costs are not affected by the fluctuations of fossil fuel prices since hydropower requires no fuel also hydroquébec has a lot of flexibility in matching supply and demand so it can sell electricity at higher prices during the day and replenish its reservoirs at night when wholesale prices are lower third the quebec power grid peaks in winter because of heating unlike most neighboring systems where peak demand occur on very warm days in the summer due to the air conditioning needs of homes and offices the election of barack obama—a supporter of renewable energy greenhouse gas emissions trading and the development of electric cars—as president of the united states in  was seen as a positive development for the companys outlook despite the success of the previous policy of shortterm sales on neighboring energy markets the quebec government asked hydroquébec management to write a new strategic plan focusing on longterm sale agreements with us distributors as was the case

its subsidiary beauharnois power and hydroquébec was created to manage the companies quebec premier adélard godbout adopted a policy of investing  million dollars per year in rural electrification however in  the government changed and the new premier maurice duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas duplessis remained in power until  and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies and hydroquébec mostly served the montreal area major projects included bersimis generating

hydroquébecs installed capacity increased from  to  mw while lowering residential power rates by half in the montreal area  the second nationalisationedit the spillway at the robertbourassa generating station can deal with a water flow twice as large as the saint lawrence river inaugurated in  the  mw generating station was at the heart of a network of  hydroelectric stations known as the james bay project duplessis conservative reign now known as the grande noirceur ended when he died in office in  the subsequent election of the quebec liberal party led by jean lesage marked the beginning of the quiet revolution a period of reform and modernisation the new government gave hydroquébec an exclusive mandate to develop new sites in  the government authorized it to acquire private electricity distributors including the gatineau power company and the shawinigan water  power company hydroquébec achieved provincewide scope all of the  rural coops accepted hydroquébec’s  buyout offer except saintjeanbaptistederouville which still exists major projects during this period included manicoutardes project a dam hydroelectric complex including the jeanlesage generating station  mw renélévesque

was stepped up to  kv a world first led by engineer jeanjacques archambault churchill falls generating station  mw the station is in labrador and the government of quebec refused to allow power to be transferred through quebec forcing the negotiation of a contract where hydroquébec buys power from the project at  prices until the year  phase i of the james bay project hydroquébec worked with atomic energy of canada limited to build the candu reactor equipped gentilly nuclear generating station which closed in   restructuringedit because of the economic climate demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early s which led to structural changes at hydroquébec it became a joint stock company whose sole shareholder is québec government to which it pays an annual dividend it

corporate structureedit hydroquébec generation and main transmission network as of  like its counterparts in the north american utility industry hydroquébec was reorganized in the late s to comply with electricity deregulation in the united states while still a vertically integrated company hydroquébec has created separate business units dealing with the generation transmission and distribution aspects of the business the transmission division transénergie was the first to be spun off in  in response to the us federal energy regulatory commissions publication of order  the restructuring was completed in the year  with the adoption of bill  which amended the act respecting the régie de lénergie to enact the functional separation of hydroquébecs various business units this functional separation and the creation of a socalled heritage pool french volume patrimonial of electricity echoed a recommendation of a merrill lynch study commissioned by the lucien bouchard government the january  report was aimed at finding a way to deregulate the electricity market in a way that was consistent with continental trends while maintaining the quebec social pact namely low uniform and stable rates across the province particularly in the residential sector legislation passed in  commits the generation division hydroquébec production to provide the distribution division hydroquébec distribution a yearly heritage pool of up to  twh of energy plus ancillary services—including an extra  twh for losses and a guaranteed peak capacity of  mw—at a set price of ¢ per kwh order in council  specifies quantities to be delivered for each of the  hourly intervals which vary from  to  mw hydroquébec distribution has to buy the remainder of the power and energy it needs—approximately  twh in  — by calling for tenders for longterm contracts open to all suppliers including hydroquébec production or targeted towards suppliers of a particular energy source like wind gas power biomass or small hydro for instance hydroquébec distribution launched calls for tenders in  and  for  and  mw of wind power respectively early deliveries started in  and the  wind farms under contract should be completely online by december  the transénergie and distribution divisions remain regulated by the régie de lénergie du québec quebec energy board an administrative tribunal established to set retail rates for electricity and natural gas for residential commercial and industrial service in the province based on a costofservice approach the régie also has extended powers including approval authority over every transmission and distributionrelated capital expenditure project exceeding c million approval of the terms of service and of longterm supply contracts dealing with customer complaints and the setting and enforcement of safety and reliability standards for the electric grid the generation division hydroquébec production is not subject to regulation by the régie however it

hydroquébecs mission by modifying the terms of the social pact of  the government issued itself  shares worth c each and the amended statute stated that hydroquébec would now pay up to  of its net earnings in dividends this amendment to the hydroquébec act started an episodic debate on whether hydroquébec should be fully or partially privatized in recent years economist marcel boyer and businessman claude garcia—both associated with the conservative think tank the montreal economic institute—have often raised the issue claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debt without going as far as boyer and garcia mario dumont the head of the action démocratique du québec briefly discussed the possibility of selling a minority stake of hydroquébec during the  election campaign a léger marketing poll conducted in november  found that a majority of quebec respondents  were opposed to his proposal to sell  of the companys equity to quebec citizens and businesses while  were in favor commenting on the issue on guy a lepages talk show former pq premier jacques parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion adding that hydroquébec is often seen by quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride this could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention the liberal government has repeatedly stated that hydroquébec is not for sale like many other economists yvan allaire from montreals hautes études commerciales business school advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the governments annual dividend without resorting to privatization others like columnist bertrand tremblay of saguenays le quotidien claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when quebecs natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices for too long tremblay writes quebec was somewhat of a banana republic almost giving away its forestry and water resources in turn those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vultures leftwing academics such as uqams léopaul lauzon and gabriel saintemarie have claimed that privatization would be done at the expense of residential customers who would pay much higher rates they say that privatization would also be a betrayal of the social pact between the people and its government and that the province would be shortselling

generations environmentedit the northern pike esox lucius is more prevalent today in the robertbourassa reservoir than it was before the flooding of the reservoir the increase of this population has been counterbalanced by a decline in the walleye stizostedion vitreum population the construction and operation of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities has environmental effects and hydroquébecs activities are no exception hydroelectric development affects the natural environment where facilities are built and on the people living in the area for instance the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers which works up the food chain it temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosion in addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilities since the early s hydroquébec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its operations the adoption of a quebec statute on environmental quality in  the cancellation of champigny project a planned pumped storage plant in the jacquescartier river valley in  and the james bay negotiations leading to the james bay and northern quebec agreement in  forced the company to reconsider its practices to address environmental concerns hydroquébec established an environmental protection committee in  and an environmental management unit in september  its mandate is to study and measure the environmental effects of the company prepare impact assessment and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities while conducting research projects in these areas in cooperation with the scientific community effects on the natural environmentedit the caribou population near major reservoirs in northern quebec has increased between  and  in the late s the company set up a network of  monitoring stations to measure the effects of the james bay project which provide a wealth of data on northern environments the first  years of studies in the james bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by  to  times over the first  to  years after the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after  to  years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a populations diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reducedflow rivers the biological diversity of reservoir islands is comparable to other islands in the area and the reservoir drawdown zone is used by a variety of wildlife the population of migratory species of interest such as the caribou have even increased to the point where the hunt has been expanded emissions of greenhouse gases ghg rise significantly for a few years after reservoir impoundment and then stabilize after  years to a level similar to that of surrounding lakes gross ghg emissions of reservoirs in the james bay area fluctuate around  tonnes of co equivalent per twh of generated power hydroquébec claims its hydroelectric

of la grande river in  another major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development specifically the innu of the north shore and the cree and inuit in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the james bay and northern quebec agreement some native communities particularly the crees have come to a point where they increasingly resemble the industrialized society of the south notes an hydroquébec report summarizing the research conducted in the area between  and  the report adds that a similar phenomenon was observed after the construction of roads and hydroelectric plants near isolated communities in northern canada and scandinavia however growing social problems and rising unemployment have followed the end of the large construction projects in the s the report concludes that future economic and social development in the area will largely depend on the desire for cooperation among the various players after the strong rejection of the suroît project and its subsequent cancellation in november  hydroquébec under the leadership of its new ceo thierry vandal reaffirmed hydroquébecs commitment towards energy efficiency hydropower and development of alternative energy since then hydroquébec regularly stresses three criteria for

on the domestic market the smurfitstone paper mill in la tuque the quebec government uses low electricity rates to attract new business and consolidate existing jobs despite its statutory obligation

 to  and was reduced to  mw in the governments – energy strategy large industrial users pay a lower rate than the domestic and commercial customers because of lower distribution costs in  the largest industrial users the rate l customers were paying an average of ¢kwh whereas companies with special contracts paid ¢kwh in  hydroquébec and the quebec government agreed to a series of controversial deals with aluminum giants alcan and alcoa these risk sharing contracts set the price of electricity based on a series of factors including aluminum world prices and the value of the canadian dollar those agreements are gradually being replaced by one based on published rates on may   the quebec government signed an agreement with alcan the agreement which is still in force despite the companys merger with rio tinto group renews the water rights concession on the saguenay and peribonka rivers in exchange alcan has agreed to invest in its quebec facilities and to maintain jobs and its corporate headquarters in montreal on december   hydroquébec and alcoa signed a similar agreement this agreement which expires in  maintains the provision of electricity to alcoas three aluminum smelters in the province located in baiecomeau bécancour and deschambaultgrondines in addition the deal will allow alcoa to modernize the baiecomeau plant which will increase its production capacity by  tonnes a year to a total of  tonnes several economists including université lavals jeanthomas bernard and gérard bélanger have challenged the governments strategy and argue that sales to large industrial customers are very costly to the quebec economy in an article published in  the researchers estimate that under the current regime a job in a new aluminum smelter or an expansion project costs the province between c and c a year when taking into consideration the money that could be made by selling the excess electricity on the new york market this argument is disputed by large industrial customers who point out that data from  to  indicate that electricity exports prices get lower when quantities increase and vice versa we find that the more we export the less lucrative it gets said luc boulanger the head of the association representing quebecs large industrial customers in his opinion the high volatility of electricity markets and the transmission infrastructure physical limitations reduce the quantities of electricity that can be exported when prices are higher export marketsedit hydroquébec exports and brokerage activities in canada and the united states –

power from  to  the memorandum of understanding provides for a price smoothing mechanism shielding vermont customers from market price spikes the deal is contingent upon the enactment designating large hydro as renewable energy the renewable energy law h was adopted by both houses of the legislature and signed into law by governor jim douglas on june   a second contract has been signed with cornwall electric a subsidiary of fortis inc a utility serving  customers in the cornwall ontario area the contract was renewed in  and will be in force until  the company has several advantages in its dealings in export markets first its costs are not affected by the fluctuations of fossil fuel prices since hydropower requires no fuel also hydroquébec has a lot of flexibility in matching supply and demand so it can sell electricity at higher prices during the day and replenish its reservoirs at night when wholesale prices are lower third the quebec power grid peaks in winter because of heating unlike most neighboring systems where peak demand occur on very warm days in the summer due to the air conditioning needs of homes and offices the election of barack obama—a supporter of renewable energy greenhouse gas emissions trading and the development of electric cars—as president of the united states in  was seen as a positive development for the companys outlook despite the success of the previous policy of shortterm sales on neighboring energy markets the quebec government asked hydroquébec management to write a new strategic plan focusing on longterm sale agreements

a policy of investing  million dollars per year in rural electrification however in  the government changed and the new premier maurice duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas duplessis remained in power until  and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies and hydroquébec

debate on whether hydroquébec should be fully or partially privatized in recent years economist marcel boyer and businessman claude garcia—both associated with the conservative think tank the montreal economic institute—have often raised the issue claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debt without going as far as boyer and garcia mario dumont the head of the action démocratique du québec briefly discussed the possibility of selling a minority stake of hydroquébec during the  election campaign a léger marketing

on the issue on guy a lepages talk show former pq premier jacques parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion adding that hydroquébec is often seen by quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride this could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention the liberal government has repeatedly stated that hydroquébec is not for sale like many other economists yvan allaire from montreals hautes études commerciales business school advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the governments annual dividend without resorting to privatization others like columnist bertrand tremblay of saguenays le quotidien claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when quebecs

transmission and distribution facilities has environmental effects and hydroquébecs activities are no exception hydroelectric development affects the natural environment where facilities are built and on the people living in the area for instance the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers which works up the food chain it temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosion in addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilities since the early s hydroquébec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its

the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after  to  years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a populations diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of

specifically the innu of the north shore and the cree and inuit in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves

electrification and the lack of french speakers in management positions in hydroelectricity companies in  montreal light heat  power company was nationalised along with its subsidiary beauharnois power and hydroquébec was created to manage the companies quebec premier adélard godbout adopted a policy of investing  million dollars per year in rural electrification however in  the government changed and the new premier maurice duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas duplessis remained in power until  and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies and hydroquébec mostly served the montreal area major projects included bersimis generating station completed in   mw bersimis generating station completed in   mw the beauharnois hydroelectric generating station completed in   mw carillon generating station built   mw between  and  hydroquébecs installed capacity increased from  to  mw while lowering residential power rates by half in the montreal area  the second nationalisationedit the spillway at the robertbourassa generating station can deal with a water flow twice as large as the saint lawrence river inaugurated in  the  mw generating station was at the heart of a network of  hydroelectric stations known as the james bay project duplessis conservative reign now known as the grande noirceur ended when he died in office in  the subsequent election of the quebec liberal party led by jean lesage marked the beginning of the quiet revolution a period of reform and modernisation the new government gave hydroquébec an exclusive mandate to develop new sites in  the government authorized it to acquire private electricity distributors including the gatineau power company and the shawinigan water  power company hydroquébec achieved provincewide scope all of the  rural coops accepted hydroquébec’s  buyout offer except saintjeanbaptistederouville which still exists major projects during this period included manicoutardes project a dam hydroelectric complex including the jeanlesage generating station  mw renélévesque generating station  mw and the danieljohnson dam  mw originally named manic manic and manic respectively because these stations were  kilometres away from the urban centers in southern quebec power was stepped up to  kv a world first led by engineer jeanjacques archambault churchill falls generating station  mw the station is in labrador and the government of quebec refused to allow power to be transferred through quebec forcing the negotiation of a contract where hydroquébec buys power from the project at  prices until the year  phase i of the james bay project hydroquébec worked with atomic energy of canada limited to build the candu reactor equipped gentilly nuclear generating station which closed in   restructuringedit because of the economic climate demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early s which led to structural changes at hydroquébec it became a joint stock company whose sole shareholder is québec government to which it pays an annual dividend it was also given the mandate to export power and to work in any energyrelated field in  the quebec – new england transmission began bringing power from the james bay project  kilometers south to the boston area phase ii of the james bay project started in  and took nine years to complete construction of the denisperron dam began in  present renewed growthedit in the late s the wholesale electricity market opened up across north america and hydroquébec opened its transmission system and wholesale electricity market to competition both inside and outside its tranditional service area the us federal energy regulatory commission granted hydroquébec a licence to sell wholesale electricity at market prices enabling hydroquébec to expand its market hydroquébec acquired a substantial share of noverco controller of natural gas distributor gaz métro to participate in that market in northeastern north america the rupert river diversion will channel part of the natural flow of the

over  kilometres  mi of medium and low voltage distribution lines in southern quebec up to  million customers were without power for up to five weeks corporate structure and financial resultsedit corporate structureedit hydroquébec generation and main transmission network as of  like its counterparts in the north american utility industry hydroquébec was reorganized in the late s to comply with electricity deregulation in the united states while still a vertically integrated company hydroquébec has created separate business units dealing with the generation transmission and distribution aspects of the business the transmission division transénergie was the first to be spun off in  in response to the us federal energy regulatory commissions publication of order  the restructuring was completed in the year  with the adoption of bill  which amended the act respecting the régie de lénergie to enact the functional separation of hydroquébecs various business units this functional separation and the creation of a socalled heritage pool french volume patrimonial of electricity echoed a recommendation of a merrill lynch study commissioned by the lucien bouchard government the january  report was aimed at finding a way to deregulate the electricity market in a way that was consistent with continental trends while maintaining the quebec social pact namely low uniform and stable rates across the province particularly in the residential sector legislation passed in  commits the generation division hydroquébec production to provide the distribution division hydroquébec distribution a yearly heritage pool of up to  twh of energy plus ancillary services—including an extra  twh for losses and a guaranteed peak capacity of  mw—at a set price of ¢ per kwh order in council  specifies quantities to be delivered for each of the  hourly intervals which vary from  to  mw hydroquébec distribution has to buy the remainder of the power and energy it needs—approximately  twh in  — by calling for tenders for longterm contracts open to all suppliers including hydroquébec production or targeted towards suppliers of a particular energy source like wind gas power biomass or small hydro for instance hydroquébec distribution launched calls for tenders in  and  for  and  mw of wind power respectively early deliveries started in  and the  wind farms under contract should be completely online by december  the transénergie and distribution divisions remain regulated by the régie de lénergie du québec quebec energy board an administrative tribunal established to set retail rates for electricity and natural gas for residential commercial and industrial service in the province based on a costofservice approach the régie also has extended powers including approval authority over every transmission and distributionrelated capital expenditure project exceeding c million approval of the terms of service and of longterm supply contracts dealing with customer complaints and the setting and enforcement of safety and reliability standards for the electric grid the generation division hydroquébec production is not subject to regulation by the régie however it must still submit every new construction project to a full environmental impact process including the release of extensive environmental studies the release of the studies are followed by a public

earnings in dividends this amendment to the hydroquébec act started an episodic debate on whether hydroquébec should be fully or partially privatized in recent years economist marcel boyer and businessman claude garcia—both associated with the conservative think tank the montreal economic institute—have often raised the issue claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debt without going as far as boyer and garcia mario dumont the head of the action démocratique du québec briefly discussed the possibility of selling a minority stake of hydroquébec during the  election campaign a léger marketing poll conducted in november  found that a majority of quebec respondents  were opposed to his proposal to sell  of the companys equity to quebec citizens and businesses while  were in favor commenting on the issue on guy a lepages talk show former pq premier jacques parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion adding that hydroquébec is often seen by quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride this could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention the liberal government has repeatedly stated that hydroquébec is not for sale like many other economists yvan allaire from montreals hautes études commerciales business school advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the governments annual dividend without resorting to privatization others like columnist bertrand tremblay of saguenays le quotidien claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when quebecs natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices for too long tremblay writes quebec was somewhat of a banana republic almost giving away its forestry and water resources in turn those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vultures leftwing academics such as uqams léopaul lauzon and gabriel saintemarie have claimed that privatization would be done at the expense of residential customers who would pay much higher rates they say that privatization would also be a betrayal of the social pact between the people and its government and that the province would be shortselling

been counterbalanced by a decline in the walleye stizostedion vitreum population the construction and operation of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities has environmental effects and hydroquébecs activities are no exception hydroelectric development affects the natural environment where facilities are built and on the people living in the area for instance the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers which works up the food chain it temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosion in addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilities since the early s hydroquébec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its operations the adoption of a quebec statute on environmental quality in  the cancellation of champigny project a planned pumped storage plant in the jacquescartier river valley in  and the james bay negotiations leading to the james bay and northern quebec agreement in  forced the company to reconsider its practices to address environmental concerns hydroquébec established an environmental protection committee in  and an environmental management unit in september  its mandate is to study and measure the environmental effects of the company prepare impact assessment and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities while conducting research projects in these areas in cooperation with the scientific community effects on the natural environmentedit the caribou population near major reservoirs in northern quebec has increased between  and  in the late s the company set up a network of  monitoring stations to measure the effects of the james bay project which provide a wealth of data on northern environments the first  years of studies in the james bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by  to  times over the first  to  years after the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after  to  years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a populations diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reducedflow rivers the biological diversity of reservoir islands is comparable to other islands in the area and the reservoir drawdown zone is used by a variety of wildlife the population of migratory species of interest such as the caribou have even increased to the point where the hunt has been expanded emissions of greenhouse gases ghg rise significantly for a few years after reservoir impoundment and then stabilize after  years to a level similar to that of surrounding lakes gross ghg emissions of reservoirs in the james bay area fluctuate around  tonnes of co equivalent per twh of generated power hydroquébec claims its hydroelectric

of la grande river in  another major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development specifically the innu of the north shore and the cree and inuit in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the james bay and northern quebec agreement some native communities particularly the crees have come to a point where they increasingly resemble the industrialized society of the south notes an hydroquébec report summarizing the research conducted in the area between  and  the report adds that a similar phenomenon was observed after the construction of roads and hydroelectric plants near isolated communities in northern canada and scandinavia however growing social problems and rising unemployment have followed the end of the large construction projects in the s the report concludes that future economic and social development in the area will largely depend on the desire for cooperation among the various players after the strong rejection of the suroît project and its subsequent cancellation in november  hydroquébec under the leadership of its new ceo thierry vandal reaffirmed hydroquébecs commitment towards energy efficiency hydropower and development of alternative energy since then hydroquébec regularly stresses three criteria for

in hydroelectricity companies in  montreal light heat  power company was nationalised along with its subsidiary beauharnois power and hydroquébec was created to manage the companies quebec premier adélard godbout adopted a policy of investing  million dollars per year in rural electrification however in  the government changed and the new premier maurice duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas duplessis remained in power until  and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies and hydroquébec mostly served the montreal area major projects included bersimis generating station completed in   mw bersimis generating station completed in   mw the beauharnois hydroelectric generating station completed in   mw carillon generating station built   mw between  and  hydroquébecs installed capacity increased from  to  mw while lowering residential power rates by half in the montreal area  the second nationalisationedit the spillway at the robertbourassa generating station can deal with a water flow twice as large as the saint lawrence river inaugurated in  the  mw generating station was at the heart of a network of  hydroelectric stations known as the james bay project duplessis conservative reign now known as the grande noirceur ended when he died in office in  the subsequent election of the quebec liberal party led by jean lesage marked the beginning of the quiet revolution a period of reform and modernisation the new government gave hydroquébec an exclusive mandate to develop new sites in  the government authorized it to acquire private electricity distributors including the gatineau power company and the shawinigan water  power company hydroquébec achieved provincewide scope all of the  rural coops accepted hydroquébec’s  buyout offer except saintjeanbaptistederouville which still exists major projects during this period included manicoutardes project a dam hydroelectric complex including the jeanlesage generating station  mw renélévesque generating station  mw and the danieljohnson dam  mw originally named manic manic and manic respectively because these stations were  kilometres away from the urban centers in southern quebec power was stepped up to  kv a world first led by engineer jeanjacques archambault churchill falls generating station  mw the station is in labrador and the government of quebec refused to allow power to be transferred through quebec forcing the negotiation of a contract where hydroquébec buys power from the project at  prices until the year  phase i of the james bay project hydroquébec worked with atomic energy of canada limited to build the candu reactor equipped gentilly nuclear generating station which closed in   restructuringedit because of the economic climate demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early s which led to structural changes at hydroquébec it became a joint stock company whose sole shareholder is québec government to which it pays an annual dividend it was also given the mandate to export power and to work in any energyrelated field in  the quebec – new england transmission began bringing power from the james bay project  kilometers south to the boston area phase ii of the james bay project started in  and took nine years to complete construction of the denisperron dam began in  present renewed growthedit in the late s the wholesale electricity market opened up across north america and hydroquébec opened its transmission system and wholesale electricity market to competition both inside and outside its tranditional service area the us federal energy regulatory commission granted hydroquébec a licence to sell wholesale electricity at market prices enabling hydroquébec to expand its market hydroquébec acquired a substantial share of noverco controller of natural gas distributor gaz métro to participate in that market in northeastern north america the rupert river diversion will channel part of the natural flow of the river orange on the map to the robertbourassa reservoir in  the agreement respecting a new

american ice storm of  five days of freezing rain collapsed  kilometres  mi of high voltage power lines and over  kilometres  mi of medium and low voltage distribution lines in southern quebec up to  million customers were without power for up to five weeks corporate structure and financial resultsedit corporate structureedit hydroquébec generation and main transmission network as of  like its counterparts in the north american utility industry hydroquébec was reorganized in the late s to comply with electricity deregulation in the united states while still a vertically integrated company hydroquébec has created separate business units dealing with the generation transmission and distribution aspects of the business the transmission division transénergie was the first to be spun off in  in response to the us federal energy regulatory commissions publication of order  the restructuring was completed in the year  with the adoption of bill  which amended the act respecting the régie de lénergie to enact the functional separation of hydroquébecs various business units this functional separation and the creation of a socalled heritage pool french volume patrimonial of electricity echoed a recommendation of a merrill lynch study commissioned by the lucien bouchard government the january  report was aimed at finding a way to deregulate the electricity market in a way that was consistent with continental trends while maintaining the quebec social pact namely low uniform and stable rates across the province particularly in the residential sector legislation passed in  commits the generation division hydroquébec production to provide the distribution division hydroquébec distribution a yearly heritage pool of up to  twh of energy plus ancillary services—including an extra  twh for losses and a guaranteed peak capacity of  mw—at a set price of ¢ per kwh order in council  specifies quantities to be delivered for each of the  hourly intervals which vary from  to  mw hydroquébec distribution has to buy the remainder of the power and energy it needs—approximately  twh in  — by calling for tenders for longterm contracts open to all suppliers including hydroquébec production or targeted towards suppliers of a particular energy source like wind gas power biomass or small hydro for instance hydroquébec distribution launched calls for tenders in  and  for  and  mw of wind power respectively early deliveries started in  and the  wind farms under contract should be completely online by december  the transénergie and distribution divisions remain regulated by the régie de lénergie du québec quebec energy board an administrative tribunal established to set retail rates for electricity and natural gas for residential commercial and industrial service in the province based on a costofservice approach the régie also has extended powers including approval authority over every transmission and distributionrelated capital expenditure project exceeding c million approval of the terms of service and of longterm supply contracts dealing with customer complaints and the setting and enforcement of safety and reliability standards for the electric grid the generation division hydroquébec production is not subject to regulation by the régie however it must still submit every new construction project to a full environmental impact process including the release of extensive environmental studies the release of the studies are followed by a public hearing process conducted by the bureau daudiences publiques sur lenvironnement hydroquébec employed

debateedit the hydroquébec building is a landmark of montreals downtown in  the parti québécois government redefined hydroquébecs mission by modifying the terms of the social pact of  the government issued itself  shares worth c each and the amended statute stated that hydroquébec would now pay up to  of its net earnings in dividends this amendment to the hydroquébec act started an episodic debate on whether hydroquébec should be fully or partially privatized in recent years economist marcel boyer and businessman claude garcia—both associated with the conservative think tank the montreal economic institute—have often raised the issue claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debt without going as far as boyer and garcia mario dumont the head of the action démocratique du québec briefly discussed the possibility of selling a minority stake of hydroquébec during the  election campaign a léger marketing poll conducted in november  found that a majority of quebec respondents  were opposed to his proposal to sell  of the companys equity to quebec citizens and businesses while  were in favor commenting on the issue on guy a lepages talk show former pq premier jacques parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion adding that hydroquébec is often seen by quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride this could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention the liberal government has repeatedly stated that hydroquébec is not for sale like many other economists yvan allaire from montreals hautes études commerciales business school advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the governments annual dividend without resorting to privatization others like columnist bertrand tremblay of saguenays le quotidien claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when quebecs natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices for too long tremblay writes quebec was somewhat of a banana republic almost giving away its forestry and water resources in turn those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vultures leftwing academics such as uqams léopaul lauzon and gabriel saintemarie have claimed that privatization would be done at the expense of residential customers who would pay much higher rates they say that privatization would also be a betrayal of the social pact between the people and its government and that the province would be shortselling itself by divesting of a choice asset for a minimal short term gain activitiesedit power

the flooding of the reservoir the increase of this population has been counterbalanced by a decline in the walleye stizostedion vitreum population the construction and operation of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities has environmental effects and hydroquébecs activities are no exception hydroelectric development affects the natural environment where facilities are built and on the people living in the area for instance the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers which works up the food chain it temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosion in addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilities since the early s hydroquébec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its operations the adoption of a quebec statute on environmental quality in  the cancellation of champigny project a planned pumped storage plant in the jacquescartier river valley in  and the james bay negotiations leading to the james bay and northern quebec agreement in  forced the company to reconsider its practices to address environmental concerns hydroquébec established an environmental protection committee in  and an environmental management unit in september  its mandate is to study and measure the environmental effects of the company prepare impact assessment and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities while conducting research projects in these areas in cooperation with the scientific community effects on the natural environmentedit the caribou population near major reservoirs in northern quebec has increased between  and  in the late s the company set up a network of  monitoring stations to measure the effects of the james bay project which provide a wealth of data on northern environments the first  years of studies in the james bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by  to  times over the first  to  years after the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after  to  years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a populations diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reducedflow rivers the biological diversity of reservoir islands is comparable to other islands in the area and the reservoir drawdown zone is used by a variety of wildlife the population of migratory species of interest such as the caribou have even increased to the point where the hunt has been expanded emissions of greenhouse gases ghg rise significantly for a few years after reservoir

george island resettled to the new village on the left bank of la grande river in  another major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development specifically the innu of the north shore and the cree and inuit in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the james bay and northern quebec agreement some native communities particularly the crees have come to a point where they increasingly resemble the industrialized society of the south notes an hydroquébec report summarizing the research conducted in the area between  and  the report adds that a similar phenomenon was observed after the construction of roads and hydroelectric plants near isolated communities in northern canada and scandinavia however growing social problems and rising unemployment have followed the end of the large construction projects in the s the report concludes that future economic and social development in the area will largely depend on the desire for cooperation among the various players after the strong rejection of the suroît project and its subsequent cancellation in november  hydroquébec under the leadership of its new ceo thierry vandal reaffirmed hydroquébecs commitment towards energy efficiency hydropower and development of alternative energy

power and hydroquébec was created to manage the companies quebec premier adélard godbout adopted a policy of investing  million dollars per year in rural electrification however in  the government changed and the new premier maurice duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas duplessis remained in power until  and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies and hydroquébec mostly served the montreal area major projects included bersimis generating station completed in   mw bersimis generating station completed in   mw the beauharnois hydroelectric generating station completed in   mw carillon generating station built   mw between  and  hydroquébecs installed capacity increased from  to  mw while lowering residential power rates by half in the montreal area  the second nationalisationedit the spillway at the robertbourassa generating station can deal with a water flow twice as large as the saint lawrence river inaugurated in  the  mw generating station was at the heart of a network of  hydroelectric stations known as the james bay project duplessis conservative reign now known as the grande noirceur ended when he died in office in  the subsequent election of the quebec liberal party led by jean lesage marked the beginning of the quiet revolution a period of reform and modernisation the new government gave hydroquébec an exclusive mandate to develop new sites in  the government authorized it to acquire private electricity distributors including the gatineau power company and the shawinigan water  power company hydroquébec achieved provincewide scope all of the  rural coops accepted hydroquébec’s  buyout offer except saintjeanbaptistederouville which still exists major projects during this period included manicoutardes project a dam hydroelectric complex including the jeanlesage generating station  mw renélévesque generating station  mw and the danieljohnson dam  mw originally named manic manic and manic respectively because these stations were  kilometres away from the urban centers in southern quebec power was stepped up to  kv a world first led by engineer jeanjacques archambault churchill falls generating station  mw the station is in labrador and the government of quebec refused to allow power to be transferred through quebec forcing the negotiation of a contract where hydroquébec buys power from the project at  prices until the year  phase i of the james bay project hydroquébec worked with atomic energy of canada limited to build the candu reactor equipped gentilly nuclear generating station which closed in   restructuringedit because of the economic climate demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early s which led to structural changes at hydroquébec it became a joint stock company whose sole shareholder is québec government to which it pays an annual dividend it was also given the mandate to export power and to work in any energyrelated field in  the quebec – new england transmission began bringing power from the james bay project  kilometers south to the boston area phase ii of the james bay project started in  and took nine years to complete construction of the denisperron dam began in  present renewed growthedit in the late s the wholesale electricity market opened up across north america and hydroquébec opened its transmission system and wholesale electricity market to competition both inside and outside its tranditional service area the us federal energy regulatory commission granted hydroquébec a licence to sell wholesale electricity at market prices enabling hydroquébec to expand its market hydroquébec acquired a substantial

corporate structureedit hydroquébec generation and main transmission network as of  like its counterparts in the north american utility industry hydroquébec was reorganized in the late s to comply with electricity deregulation in the united states while still a vertically integrated company hydroquébec has created separate business units dealing with the generation transmission and distribution aspects of the business the transmission division transénergie was the first to be spun off in  in response to the us federal energy regulatory commissions publication of order  the restructuring was completed in the year  with the adoption of bill  which amended the act respecting the régie de lénergie to enact the functional separation of hydroquébecs various business units this functional separation and the creation of a socalled heritage pool french volume patrimonial of electricity echoed a recommendation of a merrill lynch study commissioned by the lucien bouchard government the january  report was aimed at finding a way to deregulate the electricity market in a way that was consistent with continental trends while maintaining the quebec social pact namely low uniform and stable rates across the province particularly in the residential sector legislation passed in  commits the generation division hydroquébec production to provide the distribution division hydroquébec distribution a yearly heritage pool of up to  twh of energy plus ancillary services—including an extra  twh for losses and a guaranteed peak capacity of  mw—at a set price of ¢ per kwh order in council  specifies quantities to be delivered for each of the  hourly intervals which vary from  to  mw hydroquébec distribution has to buy the remainder of the power and energy it needs—approximately  twh in  — by calling for tenders for longterm contracts open to all suppliers including hydroquébec production or targeted towards suppliers of a particular energy source like wind gas power biomass or small hydro for instance hydroquébec distribution launched calls for tenders in  and  for  and  mw of wind power respectively early deliveries started in  and the  wind farms under contract should be completely online by december  the transénergie and distribution divisions remain regulated by the régie de lénergie du québec quebec energy board an administrative tribunal established to set retail rates for electricity and natural gas for residential commercial and industrial service in the province based on a costofservice approach the régie also has extended powers including approval authority over every transmission and distributionrelated capital expenditure project exceeding c million approval of the terms of service and of longterm supply contracts dealing with customer complaints and the setting and enforcement of safety and reliability standards for the electric grid the generation division hydroquébec production is not subject to regulation by the régie however it must still submit every new construction project to a full environmental impact process including the release of extensive environmental studies the release of the studies are followed by a public

hydroquébecs mission by modifying the terms of the social pact of  the government issued itself  shares worth c each and the amended statute stated that hydroquébec would now pay up to  of its net earnings in dividends this amendment to the hydroquébec act started an episodic debate on whether hydroquébec should be fully or partially privatized in recent years economist marcel boyer and businessman claude garcia—both associated with the conservative think tank the montreal economic institute—have often raised the issue claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debt without going as far as boyer and garcia mario dumont the head of the action démocratique du québec briefly discussed the possibility of selling a minority stake of hydroquébec during the  election campaign a léger marketing poll conducted in november  found that a majority of quebec respondents  were opposed to his proposal to sell  of the companys equity to quebec citizens and businesses while  were in favor commenting on the issue on guy a lepages talk show former pq premier jacques parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion adding that hydroquébec is often seen by quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride this could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention the liberal government has repeatedly stated that hydroquébec is not for sale like many other economists yvan allaire from montreals hautes études commerciales business school advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the governments annual dividend without resorting to privatization others like columnist bertrand tremblay of saguenays le quotidien claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when quebecs natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices for too long tremblay writes quebec was somewhat of a banana republic almost giving away its forestry and water resources in turn those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vultures leftwing academics such as uqams léopaul lauzon and gabriel saintemarie have claimed that privatization would be done at the expense of residential customers who would pay much higher rates they say that privatization would also be a betrayal of the social pact between the people and its government and that the province would be shortselling

electricity transmission system the micoua substation on the north shore of quebec this facility converts  kv power coming from five hydro plant to  kv this transénergie facility is one of the main nodes of the kilometre  mi long  kv network hydroquébecs expertise at building and operating a very high voltage electrical grid spreading over long distances has long been recognized in the electrical industry transénergie hydroquébecs transmission division operates the largest electricity transmission network in north america it acts as the independent system operator and reliability coordinator for the québec interconnection of the north american electric reliability corporation system and is part of the northeast power coordinating council npcc transénergie manages the flow of energy on the quebec network and ensures nondiscriminatory access to all participants involved in the wholesale market the nondiscriminatory access policy allows a company such as nalcor to sell some

neighbours on the eastern interconnection although quebec uses the same  hertz frequency as the rest of north america its grid does not use the same phase as surrounding networks transénergie mainly relies on back to back hvdc converters to export or import electricity from other jurisdictions this feature of the quebec network allowed hydroquébec to remain unscathed during the northeast blackout of august   with the exception of  hydro plants on the ottawa river radially connected to the ontario grid at the time a new mw back to back hvdc tie has been commissioned at the outaouais substation in langegardien near the ontario border the new interconnection has been online since  and the  kv line is fully operational since  one drawback of the transénergie network involves the long distances

addition to funding university research the company is the only electric utility in north america to operate its own largescale research institute linstitut de recherche dhydroquébec ireq established by lionel boulet in  the research centre is located in varennes a suburb on the south shore of montreal ireq operates on an annual research budget of approximately c million and specializes in the areas of high voltage mechanics and thermomechanics network simulations and calibration research conducted by scientists and engineers at ireq has helped to extend the life of dams improve water turbine performance automate network management and increase the transmission capacity of high voltage power lines another research centre the laboratoire des technologies de lénergie lte in shawinigan was opened in  to adapt and develop new products while helping industrial customers improve their energy efficiency in the last  years the institute has also conducted research and development work towards the electrification of ground transportation current projects include battery materials including innovative work on lithium iron phosphate and nanotitanate improved electric drive trains and the effects of the largescale deployment of electric vehicles on the power grid projects focus on technologies to increase range improve performance in cold weather and reduce charging time hydroquébec has been criticized for not having taken advantage of some of its innovations an electric wheel motor concept that struck a chord with quebecers first prototyped in  by pierre couture an engineer and physicist working at ireq is one of these the heir to the couture wheel motor is now marketed by tm electrodynamic systems a spinoff established in  that has made deals

generations environmentedit the northern pike esox lucius is more prevalent today in the robertbourassa reservoir than it was before the flooding of the reservoir the increase of this population has been counterbalanced by a decline in the walleye stizostedion vitreum population the construction and operation of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities has environmental effects and hydroquébecs activities are no exception hydroelectric development affects the natural environment where facilities are built and on the people living in the area for instance the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers which works up the food chain it temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosion in addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilities since the early s hydroquébec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its operations the adoption of a quebec statute on environmental quality in  the cancellation of champigny project a planned pumped storage plant in the jacquescartier river valley in  and the james bay negotiations leading to the james bay and northern quebec agreement in  forced the company to reconsider its practices to address environmental concerns hydroquébec established an environmental protection committee in  and an environmental management unit in september  its mandate is to study and measure the environmental effects of the company prepare impact assessment and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities while conducting research projects in these areas in cooperation with the scientific community effects on the natural environmentedit the caribou population near major reservoirs in northern quebec has increased between  and  in the late s the company set up a network of  monitoring stations to measure the effects of the james bay project which provide a wealth of data on northern environments the first  years of studies in the james bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by  to  times over the first  to  years after the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after  to  years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a populations diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reducedflow rivers the biological diversity of reservoir islands is comparable to other islands in the area and the reservoir drawdown zone is used by a variety of wildlife the population of migratory species of interest such as the caribou have even increased to the point where the hunt has been expanded emissions of greenhouse gases ghg rise significantly for a few years after reservoir impoundment and then stabilize after  years to a level similar to that of surrounding lakes gross ghg emissions of reservoirs in the james bay area fluctuate around  tonnes of co equivalent per twh of generated power hydroquébec claims its hydroelectric plants release  times less ghg than comparable gasfired plants and  times less than coalfired ones and that they constitute the option with the best performance overall social effects and sustainable developmentedit of all cree communities chisasibi was most affected by the james bay hydroelectric development project crees living on fort george island resettled to the new village on the left bank of la grande river in  another major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development specifically the innu of the north shore and the cree and inuit in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the james bay and northern quebec agreement some native communities particularly the crees have come to a point where they increasingly resemble the industrialized society of the south notes an hydroquébec report summarizing the research conducted in the area between  and  the report adds that a similar phenomenon was observed after the construction of roads and hydroelectric plants near isolated communities in northern canada and scandinavia however growing social problems and rising unemployment have followed the end of the large construction projects in the s the report concludes that future economic and social development in the area will largely depend on the desire for cooperation among the various players after the strong rejection of the suroît project and its subsequent cancellation in november  hydroquébec under the leadership of its new ceo thierry vandal reaffirmed hydroquébecs commitment towards energy efficiency hydropower and development of alternative energy since then hydroquébec regularly stresses three criteria for any new hydroelectric development undertaken by the company projects must be cost effective environmentally acceptable and well received by the communities hydroquébec has also taken part in a series of sustainable development initiatives since the late s its approach is based on three principles economic development social development and environmental protection since  the company adheres to the

according to hydroquébec the average consumption of residential and agricultural customers is relatively high at  kwh per year in  because of the widespread use of electricity as the main source of space  and water heating  hydroquébec estimates that heating accounts for more than one half of the electricity demand in the residential sector this preference for electric heating makes electricity

deals with aluminum giants alcan and alcoa these risk sharing contracts set the price of electricity based on a series of factors including aluminum world prices and the value of the canadian dollar those agreements are gradually being replaced by one based on published rates on may   the quebec government signed an agreement with alcan the agreement which is still in force despite the companys merger with rio tinto group renews the water rights concession on the saguenay and peribonka rivers in exchange alcan has agreed to invest in its quebec facilities and to maintain jobs and its

smelters in the province located in baiecomeau bécancour and deschambaultgrondines in addition the deal will allow alcoa to modernize the baiecomeau plant which will increase its production capacity by  tonnes a year to a total of  tonnes several economists including université lavals jeanthomas bernard and gérard bélanger have challenged the governments strategy and argue that sales to large industrial customers are very costly to the quebec economy in an article published in  the researchers estimate that under the current regime a job in a new aluminum smelter or an expansion project

cornwall electric a subsidiary of fortis inc a utility serving  customers in the cornwall ontario area the contract was renewed in  and will be in force until  the company has several advantages in its dealings in export markets first its costs are not affected by the fluctuations of fossil fuel prices since hydropower requires no fuel also hydroquébec has a lot of flexibility in matching supply and demand so it can sell electricity at higher prices during the day and replenish its reservoirs at night when wholesale prices are lower third the quebec power grid peaks in winter because of heating unlike most neighboring systems where peak demand occur on very warm days in the summer due to the air conditioning needs of homes and offices the election of barack obama—a supporter of renewable energy greenhouse gas emissions trading and the development of electric cars—as president of the united states in  was seen as a positive development for the companys outlook despite the

a policy of investing  million dollars per year in rural electrification however in  the government changed and the new premier maurice duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas duplessis remained in power until  and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies and hydroquébec mostly served the montreal area major projects included bersimis generating station completed in   mw bersimis generating station completed in   mw the beauharnois hydroelectric generating station completed in   mw carillon generating station built   mw between  and  hydroquébecs installed capacity increased from  to  mw while lowering residential power rates by half in the montreal area  the second nationalisationedit the spillway at the robertbourassa generating station can deal with a water flow twice as large as the saint lawrence river inaugurated in  the  mw generating station was at the heart of a network of  hydroelectric stations known as the james bay project duplessis conservative reign now known as the grande noirceur ended when he died in office in  the subsequent election of the quebec liberal party led by jean lesage marked the beginning of the quiet revolution a period of reform and modernisation the new government gave hydroquébec an exclusive mandate to develop new sites in  the government authorized it to acquire private electricity distributors including the gatineau power company and the shawinigan water  power company hydroquébec achieved provincewide scope all of the  rural coops accepted hydroquébec’s  buyout offer except saintjeanbaptistederouville which still exists major projects during this period included manicoutardes project a dam hydroelectric complex including the jeanlesage generating station  mw renélévesque generating station  mw and the danieljohnson dam  mw originally named manic manic and manic respectively because these stations were  kilometres away from the urban centers in southern quebec power was stepped up to  kv a world first led by engineer jeanjacques archambault churchill falls generating station  mw the station is

the year  phase i of the james bay project hydroquébec worked with atomic energy of canada limited to build the candu reactor equipped gentilly nuclear generating station which closed in   restructuringedit because of the economic climate demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early s which led to structural changes at hydroquébec it became a joint stock company whose sole shareholder is québec government to which it pays an annual dividend it was also given the mandate to export power and to work in any energyrelated field in  the quebec – new england transmission

utility industry hydroquébec was reorganized in the late s to comply with electricity deregulation in the united states while still a vertically integrated company hydroquébec has created separate business units dealing with the generation transmission and distribution aspects of the business the transmission division transénergie was the first to be spun off in  in response to the us federal energy regulatory commissions publication of order  the restructuring was completed in the year  with the adoption of bill  which amended the act respecting the régie de lénergie to enact the functional separation of hydroquébecs various business units this functional separation and the creation of a socalled heritage pool french volume patrimonial of electricity echoed a recommendation of a merrill lynch study commissioned by the lucien bouchard government the january  report was aimed at finding a way to deregulate the electricity market in a way that was consistent with continental trends while maintaining the quebec social pact namely low uniform and stable rates across the province particularly in the residential sector legislation passed in  commits the generation division hydroquébec production to provide the distribution division hydroquébec distribution a yearly heritage pool of up to  twh of energy plus ancillary services—including an extra  twh for losses and a guaranteed peak capacity of  mw—at a set price of ¢ per kwh order in council  specifies quantities to be delivered for each of the  hourly intervals which vary from  to  mw hydroquébec distribution has to buy the remainder of the power and energy it needs—approximately  twh in  — by calling for tenders for longterm contracts open to all suppliers including hydroquébec production or targeted towards suppliers of a particular energy source like wind gas power biomass or small hydro for instance hydroquébec distribution launched calls for tenders in  and  for  and  mw of wind power respectively early deliveries started in  and the  wind farms under contract should be completely online by december  the transénergie and distribution divisions remain regulated by the régie de lénergie du québec quebec energy board an administrative tribunal established to set retail rates for electricity and natural gas for residential commercial and industrial service in the province based on a costofservice approach the régie also has extended powers including approval authority over every transmission and distributionrelated capital expenditure project exceeding c million approval of the terms of service and of longterm supply contracts dealing with customer complaints and the setting and enforcement of safety and reliability standards for the electric grid the generation division hydroquébec production is not subject to regulation by the régie however it must still submit every new construction project to a full environmental impact process including the release of extensive environmental studies the release of the studies are followed by a public hearing process conducted by the bureau daudiences publiques sur lenvironnement hydroquébec employed

debateedit the hydroquébec building is a landmark of montreals downtown in  the parti québécois government redefined hydroquébecs mission by modifying the terms of the social pact of  the government issued itself  shares worth c each and the amended statute stated that hydroquébec would now pay up to  of its net earnings in dividends this amendment to the hydroquébec act started an episodic debate on whether hydroquébec should be fully or partially privatized in recent years economist marcel boyer and businessman claude garcia—both associated with the conservative think tank the montreal economic institute—have often raised the issue claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debt without going as far as boyer and garcia mario dumont the head of the action démocratique du québec briefly discussed the possibility of selling a minority stake of hydroquébec during the  election campaign a léger marketing poll conducted in november  found that a majority of quebec respondents  were opposed to his proposal to sell  of the companys equity to quebec citizens and businesses while  were in favor commenting on the issue on guy a lepages talk show former pq premier jacques parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion adding that hydroquébec is often seen by quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride this could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention the liberal government has repeatedly stated that hydroquébec is not for sale like many other economists yvan allaire from montreals hautes études commerciales business school advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the governments annual dividend without resorting to privatization others like columnist bertrand tremblay of saguenays le quotidien claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when quebecs natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices for too long tremblay writes quebec was somewhat of a banana republic almost giving away its forestry and water resources in turn those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vultures leftwing academics such as uqams léopaul lauzon and gabriel saintemarie have claimed that privatization would be done at the expense of residential customers who would pay much higher rates they say that privatization would also be a betrayal of the social pact between the people and its government and that the province would be shortselling itself by divesting of a choice asset for a minimal short term gain activitiesedit power

network the transénergies network operates asynchronously from that of its neighbours on the eastern interconnection although quebec uses the same  hertz frequency as the rest of north america its grid does not use the same phase as surrounding networks transénergie mainly relies on back to back hvdc converters to export or import electricity from other jurisdictions this feature of the quebec network allowed hydroquébec to remain unscathed during the northeast blackout of august   with the exception of  hydro plants on the ottawa river radially connected to the ontario grid at the time a

on the people living in the area for instance the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers which works up the food chain it temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosion in addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilities since the early s hydroquébec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its operations the adoption of a quebec statute on environmental quality in  the cancellation of champigny project a planned pumped storage plant in the jacquescartier river valley in  and the james bay negotiations leading to the james bay and northern quebec agreement in  forced the company to reconsider its practices to address environmental concerns hydroquébec established an environmental protection committee in  and an environmental management unit in september  its mandate is to study and measure the environmental effects of the company prepare impact assessment and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities while conducting research projects in these areas in cooperation with the scientific community effects on the natural environmentedit the caribou population near major reservoirs in northern quebec has increased between  and  in the late s the company set up a network of  monitoring stations to measure the effects of the james bay project which provide a wealth of data on northern environments the first  years of studies in the james bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by  to  times over the first  to  years after the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after  to  years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a populations diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reducedflow rivers the biological diversity of reservoir islands is comparable to other islands in the area and the reservoir drawdown zone is used by a variety of wildlife the population of migratory species of interest such as the caribou have even increased to the point where the hunt has been expanded emissions of greenhouse gases ghg rise significantly for a few years after reservoir impoundment and then stabilize after  years to a level similar to that of surrounding lakes gross ghg emissions of reservoirs in the james bay area fluctuate around  tonnes of co equivalent per twh of generated power hydroquébec claims its hydroelectric plants release  times less ghg than comparable gasfired plants and  times less than coalfired ones and that they constitute the option with the best performance overall social effects and sustainable developmentedit of all cree communities chisasibi was most affected by the james bay hydroelectric development project crees living on fort george island resettled to the new village on the left bank of la grande river in  another major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development specifically the innu of the north shore and the cree and inuit in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the james bay and northern quebec agreement some native communities particularly the crees have come to a point where they increasingly resemble the industrialized society of the south notes an hydroquébec report summarizing the research conducted in the area between  and  the report adds that a similar phenomenon was observed after the construction of roads and hydroelectric plants near isolated communities in northern canada and scandinavia however growing social problems and rising unemployment have followed the end of the large construction projects in the s the report concludes that future economic and social development in the area will largely depend on the desire for cooperation among the various players after the strong rejection of the suroît project and its subsequent cancellation in november  hydroquébec under the leadership of its new ceo thierry vandal reaffirmed hydroquébecs commitment towards energy efficiency hydropower and development of alternative energy since then hydroquébec regularly stresses three criteria for any new hydroelectric development undertaken by the company projects must be cost effective environmentally acceptable and well received by the communities hydroquébec has also taken part in a series of sustainable development initiatives since the late s its approach is based on three principles economic development social development

of the electricity used by residential customers in quebec according to hydroquébec the average consumption of residential and agricultural customers is relatively high at  kwh per year in  because of the widespread use of electricity as the main source of space  and water heating  hydroquébec estimates that heating accounts for more than one half of the electricity demand in the residential sector this preference for electric heating makes electricity demand more unpredictable but offers some environmental benefits despite quebecs very cold climate in winter greenhouse gases emissions in the residential sector accounted for only   mt co  eq of all emissions in quebec in  emissions from the residential sector in quebec fell by  between  and  residential use of electricity fluctuates from

hydroquébec and the quebec government agreed to a series of controversial deals with aluminum giants alcan and alcoa these risk sharing contracts set the price of electricity based on a series of factors including aluminum world prices and the value of the canadian dollar those agreements are gradually being replaced by one based on published rates on may   the quebec government signed an agreement with alcan the agreement which is still in force despite the companys merger with rio tinto group renews the water rights concession on the saguenay and peribonka rivers in exchange alcan

modernize the baiecomeau plant which will increase its production capacity by  tonnes a year to a total of  tonnes several economists including université lavals jeanthomas bernard and gérard bélanger have challenged the governments strategy and argue that sales to large industrial customers are very costly to the quebec economy in an article published in  the researchers estimate that under the current regime a job in a new aluminum smelter or an expansion project costs the province between c and c a year when taking into consideration the money that could be made by selling the excess electricity on the new york market this argument is disputed by large industrial customers who point out that data from  to  indicate that electricity exports prices get lower when quantities increase and vice versa we find that the more we export the less lucrative it gets said luc boulanger the head of the association representing quebecs large industrial customers in his opinion the high

prices are lower third the quebec power grid peaks in winter because of heating unlike most neighboring systems where peak demand occur on very warm days in the summer due to the air conditioning

montreal light heat and power linemen  beginnings and developmentedit in quebec advocates for the creation of a public hydroelectric utility protested against high costs poor rural electrification and the lack of french speakers in management positions in hydroelectricity companies in  montreal light heat  power company was nationalised along with its subsidiary beauharnois power and hydroquébec was created to manage the companies quebec premier adélard godbout adopted a policy of investing  million dollars per year in rural electrification however in  the government changed and the new premier maurice duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas duplessis remained in power until  and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies and hydroquébec mostly served the montreal area major projects included bersimis generating station completed in   mw bersimis generating station completed in   mw the beauharnois hydroelectric generating station completed in   mw carillon generating station built   mw between  and  hydroquébecs installed capacity increased from  to  mw while lowering residential power rates by half in the montreal area  the second nationalisationedit the spillway at the robertbourassa generating station can deal with a water flow twice as large as the saint lawrence river inaugurated in  the  mw generating station was at the heart of a network of  hydroelectric stations known as the james bay project duplessis conservative reign now known as the grande noirceur ended when he died in office in  the subsequent election of the quebec liberal party led by jean lesage marked the beginning of the quiet revolution a period of reform and modernisation the new government gave hydroquébec an exclusive mandate to develop new sites in  the government authorized it to acquire private electricity distributors including the gatineau power company and the shawinigan water  power company hydroquébec achieved provincewide scope all of the  rural coops accepted hydroquébec’s  buyout offer except saintjeanbaptistederouville which still exists major projects during this period included manicoutardes project a dam hydroelectric complex including the jeanlesage generating station  mw renélévesque generating station  mw and the danieljohnson dam  mw originally named manic manic and manic respectively because these stations were  kilometres away from the urban centers in southern quebec power was stepped up to  kv a world first led by engineer jeanjacques archambault churchill falls generating station  mw the station is in labrador and the government of quebec refused to allow power to be transferred through quebec forcing the negotiation of a contract where hydroquébec buys power from the project at  prices until the year  phase i of the james bay project hydroquébec worked with atomic energy of canada limited to build the candu reactor equipped gentilly nuclear generating station which closed in   restructuringedit because of the economic climate demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early s which led to structural changes at hydroquébec it became a joint stock company whose sole shareholder is québec government to which it pays an annual dividend it was also given the mandate to export power and to work in any energyrelated field in  the quebec – new england transmission began bringing power from the james bay project  kilometers south to the boston area phase ii of the james bay project started in  and took nine years to complete construction of the denisperron dam began in  present renewed growthedit in the late s the wholesale electricity market opened up across north america and hydroquébec opened its transmission system and wholesale electricity market to competition both inside and outside its tranditional service area the us federal energy regulatory commission granted hydroquébec a licence to sell wholesale electricity at market prices enabling hydroquébec to expand its market hydroquébec acquired a substantial share of noverco controller of natural gas distributor gaz métro to participate in that market in northeastern north america the rupert river diversion will channel part of the natural flow of the river orange on the map to the robertbourassa

a ninehour quebecwide blackout in the north american ice storm of  five days of freezing rain collapsed  kilometres  mi of high voltage power lines and over  kilometres  mi of medium and low voltage distribution lines in southern quebec up to  million customers were without power for up to five weeks corporate structure and financial resultsedit corporate structureedit hydroquébec generation and main transmission network as of  like its counterparts in the north american utility industry hydroquébec was reorganized in the late s to comply with electricity deregulation in the united states while still a vertically integrated company hydroquébec has created separate business units dealing with the generation transmission and distribution aspects of the business the transmission division transénergie was the first to be spun off in  in response to the us federal energy regulatory commissions publication of order  the restructuring was completed in the year  with the adoption of bill  which amended the act respecting the régie de lénergie to enact the functional separation of hydroquébecs various business units this functional separation and the creation of a socalled heritage pool french volume patrimonial of electricity echoed a recommendation of a merrill lynch study commissioned by the lucien bouchard government the january  report was aimed at finding a way to deregulate the electricity market in a way that was consistent with continental trends while maintaining the quebec social pact namely low uniform and stable rates across the province particularly in the residential sector legislation passed in  commits the generation division hydroquébec production to provide the distribution division hydroquébec distribution a yearly heritage pool of up to  twh of energy plus ancillary services—including an extra  twh for losses and a guaranteed peak capacity of  mw—at a set price of ¢ per kwh order in council  specifies quantities to be delivered for each of the  hourly intervals which vary from  to  mw hydroquébec distribution has to buy the remainder of the power and energy it needs—approximately  twh in  — by calling for tenders for longterm contracts open to all suppliers including hydroquébec production or targeted towards suppliers of a particular energy source like wind gas power biomass or small hydro for instance hydroquébec distribution launched calls for tenders in  and  for  and  mw of wind power respectively early deliveries started in  and the  wind farms under contract should be completely online by december  the transénergie and distribution divisions remain regulated by the régie de lénergie du québec quebec energy board an administrative tribunal established to set retail rates for electricity and natural gas for residential commercial and industrial service in the province based on a costofservice approach the régie also has extended powers including approval authority over every transmission and distributionrelated capital expenditure project exceeding c million approval of the terms of service and of longterm supply contracts dealing with customer complaints and the setting and enforcement of safety and reliability standards for the electric grid the generation division hydroquébec production is not subject to regulation by the régie however it must still submit every new construction project to a full environmental impact process including the release of extensive environmental studies the release of the studies are followed by a public hearing process conducted by the bureau

the hydroquébec act started an episodic debate on whether hydroquébec should be fully or partially privatized in recent years economist marcel boyer and businessman claude garcia—both associated with

and businesses while  were in favor commenting on the issue on guy a lepages talk show former pq premier jacques parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion adding that hydroquébec is often seen by quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride this could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention the liberal government has repeatedly stated that hydroquébec is not for sale like many other economists yvan allaire from montreals hautes études commerciales business school advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the governments annual dividend without resorting to privatization others like columnist bertrand tremblay of saguenays le quotidien claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when quebecs natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices for too long tremblay writes quebec was somewhat of a banana republic almost giving away its forestry and water resources in turn those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vultures leftwing academics such as uqams léopaul lauzon and gabriel saintemarie have claimed that privatization would be done at the expense of residential customers who would pay much higher rates they say that privatization would also be a betrayal of the social pact between the people and its government and that the province would be shortselling itself by divesting of a choice asset for a minimal

construction and operation of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities has environmental effects and hydroquébecs activities are no exception hydroelectric development affects the natural environment where facilities are built and on the people living in the area for instance the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers which works up the food chain it temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosion in addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilities since the early s hydroquébec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its operations the adoption of a quebec statute on environmental quality in  the cancellation of champigny project a planned pumped storage plant in the jacquescartier river valley in  and the james bay negotiations leading to the james bay and northern quebec agreement in  forced the company to reconsider its practices to address environmental concerns hydroquébec established an environmental protection committee in  and an environmental management unit in september  its mandate is to study and measure the environmental effects of the company prepare impact assessment and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities while conducting research projects in these areas in cooperation with the scientific community effects on the natural environmentedit the caribou population near major reservoirs in northern quebec has increased between  and  in the late s the company set up a network of  monitoring stations to measure the effects of the james bay project which provide a wealth of data on northern environments the first  years of studies in the james bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by  to  times over the first  to  years after the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after  to  years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a populations diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reducedflow rivers the biological diversity of reservoir islands is comparable to other islands in the area and the reservoir drawdown zone is used by a variety of wildlife the population of migratory species of interest such as the caribou have even increased to the point where the hunt has been expanded emissions of greenhouse gases ghg rise significantly for a few years after reservoir impoundment and then stabilize after  years to a level similar to that of surrounding lakes gross ghg emissions of reservoirs in the james bay area

hydroelectric development project crees living on fort george island resettled to the new village on the left bank of la grande river in  another major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development specifically the innu of the north shore and the cree and inuit in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the james bay and northern quebec agreement some native communities particularly the crees have come to a point where they increasingly resemble the industrialized society of the south notes an hydroquébec report summarizing the research conducted in the area between  and  the report adds that a similar phenomenon was observed after the construction of roads and hydroelectric plants near isolated communities in northern canada and scandinavia however growing social problems and rising unemployment have followed the end of the large construction projects in the s the report concludes that future economic and social development in the area will largely depend on the desire for cooperation among the various players after the strong

against high costs poor rural electrification and the lack of french speakers in management positions in hydroelectricity companies in  montreal light heat  power company was nationalised along with its subsidiary beauharnois power and hydroquébec was created to manage the companies quebec premier adélard godbout adopted a policy of investing  million dollars per year in rural electrification however in  the government changed and the new premier maurice duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas duplessis remained in power until  and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies and hydroquébec mostly served the montreal area major projects included bersimis generating station completed in   mw bersimis generating station completed in   mw the beauharnois hydroelectric generating station completed in   mw carillon generating station built   mw between  and  hydroquébecs installed capacity increased from  to  mw while lowering residential power rates by half in the montreal area  the second nationalisationedit the spillway at the robertbourassa generating station can deal with a water flow twice as large as the saint lawrence river inaugurated in  the  mw generating station was at the heart of a network of  hydroelectric stations known as the james bay project duplessis conservative reign now known as the grande noirceur ended when he died in office in  the subsequent election of the quebec liberal party led by jean lesage marked the beginning of the quiet revolution a period of reform and modernisation the new government gave hydroquébec an exclusive mandate to develop new sites in  the government authorized it to acquire private electricity distributors including the gatineau power company and the shawinigan water  power company hydroquébec achieved provincewide scope all of the  rural coops accepted hydroquébec’s  buyout offer except saintjeanbaptistederouville which still exists major projects during this period included manicoutardes project a dam hydroelectric complex including the jeanlesage generating station  mw renélévesque generating station  mw and the danieljohnson dam  mw originally named manic manic and manic respectively because these stations were  kilometres away from the urban centers in southern quebec power was stepped up to  kv a world first led by engineer jeanjacques archambault churchill falls generating station  mw the station is in labrador and the government of quebec refused to allow power to be transferred through quebec forcing the negotiation of a contract where hydroquébec buys power from the project at  prices until the year  phase i of the james bay project hydroquébec worked with atomic energy of canada limited to build the candu reactor equipped gentilly nuclear generating station which closed in   restructuringedit because of the economic climate demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early s which led to structural changes at hydroquébec it became a joint stock company whose sole shareholder is québec government to which it pays an annual dividend it was also given the mandate to export power and to work in any energyrelated field in  the quebec – new england transmission began bringing power from the james bay project  kilometers south to the boston area phase ii of the james bay project started in  and took nine years to complete construction of the denisperron dam began in  present renewed growthedit in the late s the wholesale electricity market opened up across north america and hydroquébec opened its transmission system and wholesale electricity market to competition both inside and outside its tranditional service area the us federal energy regulatory commission granted hydroquébec a licence to sell wholesale electricity at market prices enabling hydroquébec to expand its market hydroquébec acquired a substantial

corporate structureedit hydroquébec generation and main transmission network as of  like its counterparts in the north american utility industry hydroquébec was reorganized in the late s to comply with electricity deregulation in the united states while still a vertically integrated company hydroquébec has created separate business units dealing with the generation transmission and distribution aspects of the business the transmission division transénergie was the first to be spun off in  in response to the us federal energy regulatory commissions publication of order  the restructuring was completed in the year  with the adoption of bill  which amended the act respecting the régie de lénergie to enact the functional separation of hydroquébecs various business units this functional separation and the creation of a socalled heritage pool french volume patrimonial of electricity echoed a recommendation of a merrill lynch study commissioned by the lucien bouchard government the january  report was aimed at finding a way to deregulate the electricity market in a way that was consistent with continental trends while maintaining the quebec social pact namely low uniform and stable rates across the province particularly in the residential sector legislation passed in  commits the generation division hydroquébec production to provide the distribution division hydroquébec distribution a yearly heritage pool of up to  twh of energy plus ancillary services—including an extra  twh for losses and a guaranteed peak capacity of  mw—at a set price of ¢ per kwh order in council  specifies quantities to be delivered for each of the  hourly intervals which vary from  to  mw hydroquébec distribution has to buy the remainder of the power and energy it needs—approximately  twh in  — by calling for tenders for longterm contracts open to all suppliers including hydroquébec production or targeted towards suppliers of a particular energy source like wind gas power biomass or small hydro for instance hydroquébec distribution launched calls for tenders in  and  for  and  mw of wind power respectively early deliveries started in  and the  wind farms under contract should be completely online by december  the transénergie and distribution divisions remain regulated by the régie de lénergie du québec quebec energy board an administrative tribunal established to set retail rates for electricity and natural gas for residential commercial and industrial service in the province based on a costofservice approach the régie also has extended powers including approval authority over every transmission and distributionrelated capital expenditure project exceeding c million approval of the terms of service and of longterm supply contracts dealing with customer complaints and the setting and enforcement of safety and reliability standards for the electric grid the generation division hydroquébec production is not subject to regulation by the régie however it must still submit every new construction project to a full environmental impact process including the release of extensive environmental studies the release of the studies are followed by a public

hydroquébecs mission by modifying the terms of the social pact of  the government issued itself  shares worth c each and the amended statute stated that hydroquébec would now pay up to  of its net earnings in dividends this amendment to the hydroquébec act started an episodic debate on whether hydroquébec should be fully or partially privatized in recent years economist marcel boyer and businessman claude garcia—both associated with the conservative think tank the montreal economic institute—have often raised the issue claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debt without going as far as boyer and garcia mario dumont the head of the action démocratique du québec briefly discussed the possibility of selling a minority stake of hydroquébec during the  election campaign a léger marketing poll conducted in november  found that a majority of quebec respondents  were opposed to his proposal to sell  of the companys equity to quebec citizens and businesses while  were in favor commenting on the issue on guy a lepages talk show former pq premier jacques parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion adding that hydroquébec is often seen by quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride this could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention the liberal government has repeatedly stated that hydroquébec is not for sale like many other economists yvan allaire from montreals hautes études commerciales business school advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the governments annual dividend without resorting to privatization others like columnist bertrand tremblay of saguenays le quotidien claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when quebecs natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices for too long tremblay writes quebec was somewhat of a banana republic almost giving away its forestry and water resources in turn those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vultures leftwing academics such as uqams léopaul lauzon and gabriel saintemarie have claimed that privatization would be done at the expense of residential customers who would pay much higher rates they say that privatization would also be a betrayal of the social pact between the people and its government and that the province would be shortselling

generations environmentedit the northern pike esox lucius is more prevalent today in the robertbourassa reservoir than it was before the flooding of the reservoir the increase of this population has been counterbalanced by a decline in the walleye stizostedion vitreum population the construction and operation of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities has environmental effects and hydroquébecs activities are no exception hydroelectric development affects the natural environment where facilities are built and on the people living in the area for instance the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers which works up the food chain it temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosion in addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilities since the early s hydroquébec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its operations the adoption of a quebec statute on environmental quality in  the cancellation of champigny project a planned pumped storage plant in the jacquescartier river valley in  and the james bay negotiations leading to the james bay and northern quebec agreement in  forced the company to reconsider its practices to address environmental concerns hydroquébec established an environmental protection committee in  and an environmental management unit in september  its mandate is to study and measure the environmental effects of the company prepare impact assessment and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities while conducting research projects in these areas in cooperation with the scientific community effects on the natural environmentedit the caribou population near major reservoirs in northern quebec has increased between  and  in the late s the company set up a network of  monitoring stations to measure the effects of the james bay project which provide a wealth of data on northern environments the first  years of studies in the james bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by  to  times over the first  to  years after the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after  to  years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a populations diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reducedflow rivers the biological diversity of reservoir islands is comparable to other islands in the area and the reservoir drawdown zone is used by a variety of wildlife the population of migratory species of interest such as the caribou have even increased to the point where the hunt has been expanded emissions of greenhouse gases ghg rise significantly for a few years after reservoir impoundment and then stabilize after  years to a level similar to that of surrounding lakes gross ghg emissions of reservoirs in the james bay area fluctuate around  tonnes of co equivalent per twh of generated power hydroquébec claims its hydroelectric

of la grande river in  another major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development specifically the innu of the north shore and the cree and inuit in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the james bay and northern quebec agreement some native communities particularly the crees have come to a point where they increasingly resemble the industrialized society of the south notes an hydroquébec report summarizing the research conducted in the area between  and  the report adds that a similar phenomenon was observed after the construction of roads and hydroelectric plants near isolated communities in northern canada and scandinavia however growing social problems and rising unemployment have followed the end of the large construction projects in the s the report concludes that future economic and social development in the area will largely depend on the desire for cooperation among the various players after the strong rejection of the suroît project and its subsequent cancellation in november  hydroquébec under the leadership of its new ceo thierry vandal reaffirmed hydroquébecs commitment towards energy efficiency hydropower and development of alternative energy since then hydroquébec regularly stresses three criteria for any new hydroelectric development undertaken by the company projects must be cost effective environmentally acceptable and well received by the communities hydroquébec has also taken part in a series of sustainable development initiatives since the late s its approach is based on three principles economic development social development and environmental protection since  the company adheres to the

according to hydroquébec the average consumption of residential and agricultural customers is relatively high at  kwh per year in  because of the widespread use of electricity as the main source of space  and water heating  hydroquébec estimates that heating accounts for more than one half of the electricity demand in the residential sector this preference for electric heating makes electricity

by  tonnes a year to a total of  tonnes several economists including université lavals jeanthomas bernard and gérard bélanger have challenged the governments strategy and argue that sales to large industrial customers are very costly to the quebec economy in an article published in  the researchers estimate that under the current regime a job in a new aluminum smelter or an expansion project

its dealings in export markets first its costs are not affected by the fluctuations of fossil fuel prices since hydropower requires no fuel also hydroquébec has a lot of flexibility in matching supply and demand so it can sell electricity at higher prices during the day and replenish its reservoirs at night when wholesale prices are lower third the quebec power grid peaks in winter because of heating unlike most neighboring systems where peak demand occur on very warm days in the summer due to the air conditioning needs of homes and offices the election of barack obama—a supporter of
