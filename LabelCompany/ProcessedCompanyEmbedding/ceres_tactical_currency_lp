realized they are valued at fair value generally on a daily basis and the unrealized gains and losses on open contracts the difference between contract trade price and market price are reported in the

are realized when contracts are liquidated and are determined using the firstin firstout method risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts and the potential inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts there are numerous factors which may significantly influence the fair value of these contracts including interest rate volatility the fair value of an exchangetraded contract is based on the settlement price quoted by the exchange on the day with respect to which fair value is being determined if an exchangetraded contract could not have been

in us treasury bills at fair value if applicable because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the partnershipmaster fund while substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity no such illiquidity occurred in the first quarter of  the master funds investment in futures interests may from time to time be illiquid most us futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit if the price for a particular futures or option contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in that futures or option contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading these market conditions could prevent the master fund from promptly liquidating its futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions there is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies the markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid which may prevent the master fund from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the master fund from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets subjecting it to substantial losses either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions for the periods covered by this report illiquidity has not materially affected the partnerships assets other than the risks inherent in commodity futures forward options swaps and other derivatives trading and us treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities the partnership knows of no trends demands commitments

or capital resources    critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the general partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period the general partner believes that the estimates and assumptions utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable actual results could differ from those estimates the partnerships significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies of the financial statements the partnership records all investments at fair value in their financial statements with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains losses and net change in unrealized trading gains losses in the statements of income and expenses results of operations general cambridge employs a series of systematic proprietary decision tools to identify trading opportunities in the global currency markets the process combines three types of trading strategies a systematic technical strategy a systematic fundamental strategy and a market information strategy these trading tools are utilized in a set of systematic strategies which are combined into investment portfolios and are designed to perform across diverse market environments the systematic fundamental strategy is used in the asian currency section of the cambridge portfolios and reflects a predetermined set of positions designed to reflect market views on the relative attractiveness of asian currencies versus the us dollar assets are allocated to the systematic fundamental strategy based on a proprietary measure of volatility in the global currency markets in highly volatile markets the allocation is reduced and when volatility is low the allocation is increased the market information strategy leverages the experience and global network of the portfolio managers to understand and exploit the behavior of other market participants and to participate in hedging and investment flows cambridge believes that long run success is achieved through successful mitigation of downside returns with risk controlled at the portfolio strategy and individual trade levels the following presents a summary of the partnerships operations for the three months ended march   and  and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period it is important to note however that the trading advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisor or will be profitable in the future consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading advisors trading activities on behalf of the partnership during the period in question past performance is no guarantee of future results the partnerships results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements including the following the contracts the partnership trades indirectly are accounted for on a tradedate basis and marked to market on a daily basis the difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the statements of income and expenses as net change in unrealized gains losses on open contracts allocated from the master fund on open contracts and recorded as net realized gains losses on closed contracts allocated from the master fund when open positions are closed out the sum of these amounts constitutes the partnerships trading results the market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day the value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of approximately  pm et the close of the business day interest income as well as management fees incentive fees general partner fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the partnership are recorded on an accrual basis    the general partner believes that based on the nature of the operations of the partnership no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts during the partnerships first quarter of  the partnerships net asset value per unit increased  from  to  as compared to an increase of  during the first quarter of  the partnership through its investment in the master fund experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses in the first quarter of  of  gains were primarily attributable to the master funds trading in currencies the partnership through its investment in the master fund experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses in the first quarter  of  gains were primarily attributable to the master funds trading in currencies the most significant gains were experienced during march from long positions in the indian rupee versus the us dollar as the relative value of the indian rupee advanced after prime minister narendra modis resounding victory in state elections boosted expectations for a continuation of his reform agenda the indian currency was boosted further amid speculation the reserve bank of india will not lower interest rates elsewhere gains were experienced throughout the first quarter from long positions in the new zealand dollar versus the us dollar as the relative value of the us dollar moved lower amid increased uncertainty of future us fiscal policy and warnings on the negative effect protectionist policies could have on the us economy additional gains during the quarter were recorded from positions in the taiwan dollar and russian ruble a portion of the partnerships gains for the quarter was offset by losses from positions in the turkish lira japanese yen and mexican peso    item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all or substantially all of the partnerships assets are subject to risk of trading loss through its investment in the master fund the partnership and the master fund are speculative commodity pools the market sensitive instruments held by the master fund are acquired for speculative trading purposes and all or substantially all of the partnerships assets are subject to the risk of trading loss through its investment in the master fund unlike an operating company the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral not incidental to the partnerships and the master funds main line of business the limited partners will not be liable for losses exceeding the current net asset value of their investment market movements result in frequent changes in the fair value of the master funds open positions and consequently in its earnings and cash balances the master funds market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the level and volatility of interest rates exchange rates equity price levels the market value of financial instruments and contracts the diversification effects of the master funds open contracts and the liquidity of the markets in which its trade the master fund rapidly acquires and liquidates

beyond the indicated value at risk or the master funds experience to date ie risk of ruin in light of the foregoing as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections the

ceres managed futures llc which are both owned and controlled by mssb market and manage the sale of the morgan stanley spectrum series of managed futures funds morgan stanley smith barney and ceres managed futures llc acting as sponsor general partner manager investment manager and investment advisor to pooled investment vehicles with portfolios of managed futures funds are marketed and sold to institutional and highnetworth hnw investors through the mssb spectrum series of managed futures funds the rationale provided by morgan stanley’s financial advisors used to support its recommendation that investors allocate a portion of their portfolio in managed futures contracts is to generate portfolio returns with greater returns on a riskadjusted basis the purported low correlation of managed futures funds with the overall securities markets provides superior results for an investment portfolio during “down markets” which smooth portfolio returns over time morgan stanley financial advisors caution investors that they cannot “markettime” when to invest in managed futures funds which they argue makes investments in managed futures funds a permanent part of a buyhold asset allocation strategy the morgan stanley spectrum series of managed futures funds invest in asset classes that include trading futures contracts in equity indices ie developed and emerging markets interest rates ie us bonds eurodollar bonds eurobund commodities ie energy agriculture and metals and currencies ie dollar euro pound yen through investments in managed futures funds investors are allegedly able to access invests in nontraditional asset classes that have a low correlation with traditional equity and fixed income securities markets resulting an overall increase in investment returns on a riskadjusted basis at issue for investors is the performance of morgan stanley’s managed futures funds after the management fees have been deducted from the account in most instances investment advisors are compensated by a flat management fee based on assets under management additionally an “incentivebased” fee is deducted based on profits in “up” years this “performancebased” fee is usually paid net of all fees in addition to management and performance fees a managed futures account has deducted from the balance expenses for transactions costs and commissions the net result for investors has been the loss of trading profits from a poorlyexplained regime of excessive fees and conflicts of interest designed to enrich morgan stanley the morgan stanley spectrum series of managed
