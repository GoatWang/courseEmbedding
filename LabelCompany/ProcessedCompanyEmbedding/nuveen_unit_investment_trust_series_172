fractional undivided interest in the principal and net income of such trust in the ratio set forth in essential information in part a of this prospectus units may only be sold in states in which they are registered to the extent that any units of any trust are redeemed by the trustee the aggregate value of the trusts assets will decrease by the amount paid to the redeeming unitholder but the fractional undivided interest of each unredeemed unit in such trust will increase proportionately the sponsor will initially and from time to time thereafter hold units in connection with their

diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer iv the maturity dates of the bonds and v in the case of the insured trusts only the availability of mbia insurance corporation insurance on such bonds see why and how are the bonds insured  risk factors an investment in units of any trust should be made with an understanding of the risks that such an investment may entail each trust consists of fixedrate municipal debt obligations as such the value of the debt obligations and therefore of the units will decline with increases in interest rates in general the longer the period until the maturity of a bond the more sensitive its value will be to fluctuations in interest rates the sponsor cannot predict the extent or timing of such fluctuations and accordingly their effect upon the value of the bonds additional risk factors include the ability of the issuer or if applicable an insurer to make payments of interest and principal when due mandatory put features early call provisions and the potential for changes in the tax status of the bonds as set forth in part a of this prospectus the trusts may contain or be concentrated in one or more of the types of bonds discussed below the following paragraphs briefly discuss certain circumstances which may adversely affect the ability of issuers of bonds held in the portfolio of a trust to make payments of principal and interest thereon and which also therefore may adversely affect the ratings of such bonds with respect to insured trusts however because of the insurance obtained by the sponsor or by the issuers of the bonds such changes should not adversely affect an insured trusts receipt of principal and interest or the standard  poors aaa the moodys aaa or the fitch aaa ratings of the bonds in the insured trust portfolio the bonds described below may be subject to special or extraordinary redemption provisions for economic risks specific to the individual trusts see part a of this prospectus and the appendices to the information supplement of this prospectus escrow secured obligations are typically secured by direct obligations of the us government or in some cases obligations guaranteed by the us government placed in an escrow account maintained by an independent trustee until maturity or a predetermined redemption date these obligations are generally noncallable prior to maturity or the predetermined redemption date in a few isolated instances however bonds which were thought to be escrowed to maturity have been called for redemption prior to maturity health care facility obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from services provided by hospitals or other health care facilities including nursing homes the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including occupancy levels of the facility demand for services wages of employees overhead expenses competition from other similar providers government regulation the cost of malpractice insurance and the degree of governmental financial assistance including medicare and medicaid housing obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from mortgage loans on single family residences or housing projects for low to moderate income families housing obligations are generally prepayable at any time and therefore their average life will ordinarily be less than their stated maturities the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including occupancy levels rental income mortgage default rates taxes operating expenses governmental regulations and the appropriation of subsidies industrial revenue obligations are industrial revenue bonds irbs including pollution control revenue bonds which are taxexempt securities issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various industrial projects debt service payment on irbs is dependent upon various factors including the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and if applicable corporate guarantor revenues generated from the project expenses associated with the project and regulatory and environmental restrictions utility obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of several types of energy including electric and natural gas the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including the rates for electricity and natural gas the demand for electricity and natural gas the degree of competition governmental regulation overhead expenses and variable costs such as fuel transportation facility revenue obligations are obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of airports public transit systems and ports the ability of issuers to make debt service payments on airport obligations is dependent on the capability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors many airlines may have difficulty meeting their obligations under these use agreements bonds that are secured primarily by the revenue collected by a public transit system typically are additionally secured by a pledge of sales tax receipts collected at the state or local level or of other governmental financial assistance the revenue of issuers of transit system obligations will be affected by variations in utilization which in turn may be affected by the degree of local governmental subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive their revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the facilities which may fluctuate depending on the local economy and on competition from competing forms of transportation such as air rail and trucks the revenues of issuers which derive their payments from bridge road or tunnel toll revenues could be adversely affected by increases in fuel costs competition from tollfree vehicular bridges and roads and alternative modes of transportation water andor sewerage obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are payable from user fees from the sale of water andor sewerage services the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain rate increases population declines the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulties obtaining new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and nogrowth zoning ordinances  university and college revenue obligations are obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived mainly from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems faced by such issuers include declines in the number of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers dedicatedtax supported obligations are obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by tax revenues from a designated source which revenues are pledged to secure the bonds the various types of bonds described below differ in structure and with respect to the rights of the bondholders to the underlying property each type of dedicatedtax supported bond has distinct risks only some of which are set forth below one type of dedicatedtax supported bond is secured by the incremental tax received on either real property or on sales within a specifically defined geographical area such tax generally will not provide bondholders with a lien on the underlying property or revenues another type of dedicatedtax supported bond is secured by a special tax levied on real property within a defined geographical area in such a manner that the tax is levied on those who benefit from the project such bonds typically provide for a statutory lien on the underlying property for unpaid taxes a third type of dedicatedtax supported bond may be secured by a tax levied upon the manufacture sale or consumption of commodities or upon the license to pursue certain occupations or upon corporate privileges within a taxing jurisdiction as to any of these types of bonds the ability of the designated revenues to satisfy the interest and principal payments on such bonds may be affected by changes in the local economy the financial success of the enterprise responsible for the payment of the taxes the value of any property on which taxes may be assessed and the ability to collect such taxes in a timely fashion each of these factors will have a different affect on each distinct type of dedicatedtax supported bonds municipal lease obligations are obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity and are normally subject to annual budget appropriations of the leasing governmental entity a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby original issue discount obligations and stripped obligations are bonds which were issued with nominal interest rates less than the rates then offered by comparable securities and as a consequence were originally sold at a discount from their face or par values in a stable interest rate environment the market value of an original issue discount bond would tend to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bond approached maturity certain of the original issue discount obligations in a trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds do not provide for the payment of any current interest the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment of the face amount of the bond at its maturity zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality that pay interest currently original issue discount obligations including zero coupon bonds may be subject to redemption at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption the accreted value plus if applicable some premium pursuant to such call provisions an original issue discount bond may be called prior to its maturity date at a price less than its face value see the schedule of investments appearing in part a of this prospectus for more information about the call provisions of portfolio bonds certain of the bonds in a trust may be stripped obligations which represent evidences of ownership with respect to either the principal amount of or a payment of interest on a taxexempt obligation stripped obligations each stripped obligation has been purchased at a discount from the amount payable at maturity a stripped obligation therefore has economic characteristics similar to zero coupon bonds as described above unitholders should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the state and local tax consequences of owning original issue discount bonds or stripped obligations under applicable provisions governing determination of state and local taxes interest on original issue discount obligations or stripped obligations may be deemed to be received in the year of accrual even though there is no corresponding cash payment certain bonds may carry a mandatory put also referred to as a mandatory tender or mandatory repurchase feature pursuant to which the holder of such bonds will receive payment of the full principal amount thereof on a stated date prior to the maturity date unless such holder affirmatively acts to retain the bond the trustee does not have the authority to act to retain bonds with such features accordingly it will receive payment of the full principal amount of any such bonds on the stated put date and such date is therefore treated as the maturity date of such bonds in selecting bonds for the respective trusts and for purposes of calculating the average maturity of the bonds in any trust composition of trusts each trust initially consists of delivery statements relating to contracts to purchase bonds or of such bonds as are listed under schedule of investments in part a of this prospectus and thereafter of such bonds as may continue to be held from time to time including certain securities deposited in the trust in substitution for bonds not delivered to a trust or in  exchange or substitution for bonds upon certain refundings together with accrued and undistributed interest thereon and undistributed cash realized from the disposition of bonds whenissued and delayed delivery transactions the contracts to purchase bonds delivered to the trustee represent an obligation by issuers or dealers to deliver bonds to the sponsor for deposit in the trusts certain of the contracts relate to bonds which have not been issued as of the date of deposit and which are commonly referred to as when issued or when as and if issued bonds although the sponsor believes it unlikely if such bonds or replacement bonds described below are not acquired by a trust or if their delivery is delayed the estimated current returns and estimated long term returns shown in part a of this prospectus may be reduced certain of the contracts for the purchase of bonds provide for delivery dates after the date of settlement for purchases made on the date of deposit interest on such when issued and delayed delivery bonds accrues to the benefit of unitholders commencing with the first settlement date for the units however in the opinion of counsel unitholders who purchase their units prior to the date such bonds are actually delivered to the trustee must reduce the tax basis of their units for interest accruing on such bonds during the interval between their purchase of units and the delivery of the bonds because such amounts constitute a return of principal as a result of such adjustment the estimated current returns set forth in part a of this prospectus which are based on the public offering price as of the business day prior to the date of deposit may be slightly lower than that which unitholders will receive after the first year assuming the portfolio does not change and estimated annual expense does not vary from that set forth under essential information in part a of this prospectus those bonds in each trust purchased with delivery dates after the date of settlement for purchases made on the date of deposit are so noted in the schedule of investments in part a of this prospectus limited replacement of certain bonds neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any bond in the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been purchased for a trust under a contract including those bonds purchased on a when as and if issued basis failed bonds the sponsor is authorized under the indenture to direct the trustee to acquire other specified bonds replacement bonds to make up the original corpus of the trust within  days after delivery of notice of the failed contract and the cost to the trust exclusive of accrued interest may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the failed bonds the replacement bonds must satisfy the criteria previously described for the trusts and shall be substantially identical to the failed bonds they replace in terms of i the exemption from federal and state taxation ii maturity and iii cost to the trust in addition replacement bonds shall not be when as and if issued bonds whenever a replacement bond has been acquired for a trust the trustee shall within five days after the delivery thereof mail or deliver a notice of such acquisition to all unitholders of the trust involved once the original corpus of the trust is acquired the trustee will have no power to vary the investment of the trust to the extent replacement bonds are not acquired the sponsor shall refund to all unitholders of the trust involved the sales charge attributable to such failed bonds not replaced and the principal and accrued interest attributable to such bonds shall be distributed not more than  days after the determination of such failure or at such earlier time as the trustee in its sole discretion deems to be in the interest of the unitholders any such accrued interest paid to unitholders will be paid by the sponsor and accordingly will not be treated as taxexempt income in the event failed bonds in a trust could not be replaced the net annual interest income per unit for such trust would be reduced and the estimated current return thereon might be lowered sale maturity and redemption of bonds certain of the bonds may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with their terms the proceeds from such events will be used to pay for units redeemed or distributed to unitholders and not reinvested accordingly no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition all of the bonds in each trust are subject to being called or redeemed in whole or in part prior to their stated maturities pursuant to the optional redemption provisions described in the schedule of investments in part a of this prospectus and in most cases pursuant to a sinking fund or special or extraordinary redemption provisions see the discussion of the various types of bond issues above for information on the call provisions of such bonds particularly single family mortgage revenue bonds the exercise of redemption or call provisions will except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit redemptions result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions it may also affect the current return on units of the trust involved the exercise of redemption or call provisions is more likely to occur in situations where the bonds have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par as opposed to a discount from par in the case of original issue discount bonds such redemption is generally to be made at the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to the date of redemption such price is referred to herein as accreted value because bonds may have been valued at prices above or below par value or the then current accreted value at the time units were purchased unitholders may realize gain or loss upon the redemption of portfolio bonds see what is the tax status of unitholders and when are distributions made to unitholders in part b and the schedule of investments in part a of this prospectus  certain tax matters litigation certain of the bonds in a trusts portfolio may be subject to continuing requirements regarding the actual use of bond proceeds the manner of operation of the project financed from bond proceeds or the rebate of excess earnings on bond proceeds any of which may affect the exemption of interest on such bonds from federal income taxation although at the time of issuance of each of the bonds in each trust an opinion of bond counsel was rendered as to the exemption of interest on such obligations from federal income taxation and the issuers covenanted to comply with all requirements necessary to retain the taxexempt status of the bonds there can be no assurance that the respective issuers or other obligors on such obligations will fulfill the various continuing requirements established upon issuance of the bonds a failure to comply with such requirements may cause a determination that interest on such obligations is subject to federal income taxation perhaps even retroactively from the date of issuance of such bonds thereby reducing the value of the bonds and subjecting unitholders to unanticipated tax liabilities to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date of deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on any of the trusts it is possible that after the date of deposit litigation may be initiated with respect to bonds in any trust any such litigation may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxexempt nature of the interest thereon but while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted the opinions of bond counsel to the issuer of each bond on the date of issuance state that such bonds were validly issued and that the interest thereon is to the extent indicated exempt from federal income tax why and how are the bonds insured insurance guaranteeing the

applicable to quantity purchases is reduced on a graduated scale for sales to any purchaser of at least  or  units and will be applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the purchaser for purposes of calculating the applicable sales charge purchasers who have indicated their intent to purchase a specified amount of units of any trust in the primary or secondary offering period by executing and delivering a letter of intent to the sponsor which letter of intent must be in a form acceptable to the sponsor and shall have a maximum duration of thirteen months will be eligible to receive a reduced sales charge according to the following tables based on the amount of intended aggregate purchases as expressed in the letter of intent due to administrative limitations and in order to permit adequate tracking the only secondary market purchases that will be permitted to be applied toward the intended specified amount and that will receive the corresponding reduced sales charge are those units that are acquired through or from the sponsor by establishing a letter of intent a unitholder agrees that the first purchase of units following the execution of such letter of intent will be at least  of the total amount of the intended aggregate purchases expressed in such unitholders letter of intent further through the establishment of the letter of intent such unitholder agrees that units representing  of the total amount of the intended purchases will be held in escrow by the trustee pending completion of these purchases all distributions on units held in escrow will be credited to such unitholders account if total purchases prior to the expiration of the letter of intent period equal or exceed the amount specified in a unitholders letter of intent the units held in escrow will be transferred to such unitholders account a unitholder who purchases units during the letter of intent period in excess of the number of units specified in a unitholders letter of intent the amount of which would cause the unitholder to be eligible to receive an additional sales charge reduction will be allowed such additional sales charge reduction on the purchase of units which caused the unitholder to reach such new breakpoint level and on all additional purchases of units  during the letter of intent period if the total purchases are less than the amount specified the unitholder involved must pay the sponsor an amount equal to the difference between the amounts paid for these purchases and the amounts which would have been paid if the higher sales charge had been applied the unitholder will however be entitled to any reduced sales charge qualified for by reaching any lower breakpoint level if such unitholder does not pay the additional amount within  days after written request by the sponsor or the unitholders securities representative the sponsor will instruct the trustee to redeem an appropriate number of the escrowed units to meet the required payment by establishing a letter of intent a unitholder irrevocably appoints the sponsor as attorney to give instructions to redeem any or all of such unitholders escrowed units with full power of substitution in the premises a unitholder or his securities representative must notify the sponsor whenever such unitholder makes a purchase of units that he wishes to be counted towards the intended

bid price of each bond in the trust a sales charge determined in accordance with the table set forth below based upon the number of years remaining to the maturity of each such bond see unit value and evaluation the effect of this method of sales charge calculation will be that different sales charge rates will be applied to the various bonds in a trust portfolio based upon the maturities of such bonds as shown the sales charge on bonds in each maturity range and therefore the aggregate sales charge on the purchase is reduced with respect to purchases of at least  or  units amount of purchase

as a percent of the net amount invested expressed as a percent of the public offering price the maximum sales charge on a trust for instance one consisting entirely of bonds with  years or more to maturity would be   of the net amount invested the actual secondary market sales charge included in the public offering price of any particular trust will depend on the maturities of the bonds in the portfolio of such trust  pursuant to the terms of the indenture the trustee may terminate a trust if the net asset value of such trust as shown by any evaluation is less than  of the original principal amount of the trust at all times while units are being offered for sale the sponsor will appraise or cause to be appraised daily the value of the underlying bonds in each trust as of  pm eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the new york stock exchange the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time and will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such appraisal such public offering price will be effective for all orders received by a dealer or the sponsor at or prior to  pm eastern time on each such day or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time orders received after that time or on a day when the exchange is closed for a scheduled holiday or weekend will be held until the next determination of price accrued interest from the preceding record date to but not including the settlement date of the transaction three business days after purchase will be added to the public offering price to determine the purchase price of units see what is accrued interest the graduated sales charges set forth above will apply on all applicable purchases of nuveen investment company securities on any one day by the same purchaser in the amounts stated and for this purpose purchases of this series will be aggregated with concurrent purchases of any other series or of shares of any openend management investment company of which the sponsor is principal underwriter and with respect to the purchase of which a sales charge is imposed purchases by or for the account of individuals and their spouses parents children grandchildren grandparents parentsinlaw sons and daughtersinlaw siblings a siblings spouse and a spouses siblings immediate family members will be aggregated to determine the applicable sales charge the graduated sales charges are also applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing securities for a single trust estate or single fiduciary account units may be purchased at the public offering price without a sales charge by officers or directors and by bona fide fulltime employees

departments investing funds over which they exercise exclusive discretionary investment authority and that are held in a fiduciary agency custodial or similar capacity  any person who for at least  days has been an officer director or bona fide employee of any firm offering units for sale to investors or their immediate family members as defined above and  officers and directors of bank holding companies that make units available directly or through subsidiaries or bank affiliates collectively the discounted purchases in addition such investors may purchase units in the secondary market at the public offering price for nonbreakpoint purchases minus the concession the sponsor typically allows to brokers and dealers for nonbreakpoint purchases notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this prospectus investors who purchase units as described in this paragraph will not receive sales charge reductions for quantity purchases the initial or primary public offering price of the units in each trust is based upon a pro rata share of the offering prices per unit of the bonds in such trust plus the applicable sales charge the secondary market public offering price of each trust is based upon a pro rata share of the bid prices per unit of the bonds in such trust plus the applicable sales charge the offering prices of bonds in a trust may be expected to average between  to  more than the bid prices of such bonds the difference between the bid side evaluation and the offering side evaluation of the bonds in each trust on the business day prior to the date of deposit is shown in the discussion of each trust portfolio whether or not units are being offered for sale the sponsor will determine the aggregate value of each trust as of  pm eastern time i on each june  or december  or if such date is not a business day the last business day prior thereto ii on any day on which a unit is tendered for redemption or the next succeeding business day if the date of tender is a nonbusiness day and iii at such other times as may be necessary for this purpose a business day shall be any day on which the exchange is normally open see unit value and evaluation market for units during the initial public offering period the sponsor intends to offer to purchase units of each trust at a price equivalent to the pro rata share per unit of the offering prices of the bonds in such trust plus accrued interest afterward although it is not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a secondary market for units of each trust at its own expense and continuously to offer to purchase units of each trust at prices subject to change at any time which are based upon the bid prices of bonds in the respective portfolios of the trusts unitholders who wish to dispose of their units should inquire of the trustee or their broker as to the current redemption price see how units may be redeemed without charge in connection with its secondary marketmaking activities the sponsor may from time to time enter into secondary market joint account agreements with other brokers and dealers pursuant to such an agreement the sponsor will  purchase units from the broker or dealer at the bid price and will place the units into a joint account managed by the sponsor sales from the account will be made in accordance with the then current prospectus and the sponsor and the broker or dealer will share profits and losses in the joint account in accordance with the terms of their joint account agreement certificates if any for units are delivered to the purchaser as promptly after the date of settlement three business days after purchase as the trustee can complete the mechanics of registration normally within  hours after registration instructions are received purchasers of units to whom certificates are issued will be unable to exercise any right of redemption until they have received their certificates properly endorsed for transfer see how units may be redeemed without charge what is accrued interest accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid interest on bonds in each trust is accounted for daily on an accrual basis for this reason the purchase price of units of a trust will include not only the public offering price but also the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement accrued interest does not include accrual of original issue discount on zero coupon bonds stripped obligations or other original issue discount bonds interest accrues to the benefit of unitholders commencing with the settlement date of their purchase transaction in an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest that investors would have to pay in addition to the public offering price the trustee has agreed to advance to each trust the amount of accrued interest due on the bonds as of the date of deposit which has been designated the first record date for all plans of distribution this accrued interest will be paid to the sponsor as the holder of record of all units on the date of deposit consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the date of deposit to but not including the date of settlement of the investors purchase three business days after purchase less any distributions from the related interest account the trustee will recover its advancements without interest or other cost to the trusts from interest received on the bonds deposited in each trust the trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in the trusts since municipal bond interest is accrued daily but paid only semiannually during the initial months of the trusts the interest accounts consisting of accrued but uncollected interest and collected interest cash will be predominantly the uncollected accrued interest that is not available for distribution however due to advances by the trustee the trustee will provide a first distribution between approximately  and  days after the date of deposit assuming each trust retains its original size and composition and expenses and fees remain the same annual interest collected and distributed will approximate the estimated net annual interest income stated herein however the amount of accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount that the trustee will have actually received and distributed to the unitholders therefore there will always remain an item of accrued interest that is included in the purchase price and the redemption price of the units interest is accounted for daily and a proportionate share of accrued and undistributed interest computed from the preceding record date is added to the daily valuation of each unit of each trust see part a of this prospectus and when are distributions made to unitholders as bonds mature or are redeemed or sold the accrued interest applicable to such bonds is collected and subsequently distributed to unitholders unitholders who sell or redeem all or a portion of their units will be paid their proportionate share of the remaining accrued interest to but not including the third business day following the date of sale or tender what are estimated long term return and estimated current return the estimated long term return for each trust is a measure of the return to the investor expected to be earned over the estimated life of the trust the estimated long term return represents an average of the yields to maturity or call of the bonds in the trusts portfolio calculated in accordance with accepted bond practice and adjusted to reflect expenses and sales charges under accepted bond practice taxexempt bonds are customarily offered to investors on a yield price basis which involves computation of yield to maturity or to an earlier call date whichever produces the lower yield and which takes into account not only the interest payable on the bonds but also the amortization or accretion of any premium over or discount from the par maturity value inherent in the bonds purchase price in the calculation of estimated long term return the average yield for a trusts portfolio is derived by weighting each bonds yield by the market value of the bond and by the amount of time remaining to the date to which the bond is priced this weighted average yield is then adjusted to reflect estimated expenses is compounded and is reduced by a factor which represents the amortization of the sales charge over the expected average life of a trust the estimated long term return calculation does not take into account the effect of a first distribution which may be less than a regular distribution or may be paid at some point after  days or a second distribution which may be less than a normal distribution for unitholders who choose quarterly or semiannual plans of distribution and it also does not take into account the difference in timing of payments to unitholders who choose quarterly or semiannual plans of distribution each of which will reduce the return  estimated current return is computed by dividing the net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price in contrast to estimated long term return estimated current return does not reflect the amortization of premium or accretion of discount if any on the bonds in a trusts portfolio net annual interest income per unit is calculated by dividing the annual interest income to a trust less estimated expenses by the number of units outstanding net annual interest income per unit used to calculate estimated current return will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the trustee and the evaluator and with the redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds a unitholders actual return may vary significantly from the estimated longterm return based on their holding period market interest rate changes other factors affecting the prices of individual bonds in the portfolio and differences between the expected remaining life of portfolio bonds and the actual length of time that they remain in a trust such actual holding periods may be reduced by termination of a trust as described in other information since both the estimated current return and the estimated long term return quoted herein are based on the market value of the underlying bonds on the business day prior to the date of deposit subsequent calculations of these performance measures will reflect the then current market value of the underlying bonds and may be higher or lower the sponsor will provide estimated cash flow information relating to a trust without charge to each potential investor in a trust who receives this prospectus and makes an oral or written request to the sponsor for such information a portion of the monies received by a trust may be treated in the first year only as a return of principal due to the inclusion in the trust portfolio of whenissued or other bonds having delivery dates after the date of settlement for purchases made on the date of deposit a consequence of this treatment is that in the computation of estimated current return for the first year such monies are excluded from net annual interest income and treated as an adjustment to the public offering price see essential information appearing in part a of this prospectus composition of trusts and what is the tax status of unitholders a comparison of taxfree and equivalent taxable estimated current returns with the returns on various taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment decision the sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on a trust and returns over specified periods on other similar nuveen trusts with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or us government bonds bank cds and money market accounts or money market funds each of which has investment characteristics that may differ from those of the trust us government bonds for example are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government and bank cds and money market accounts are insured by an agency of the federal government money market accounts and money market funds provide stability of principal but pay interest at rates that vary with the condition of the shortterm debt market the investment characteristics of the trusts are described more fully elsewhere in the prospectus how was the price of the bonds determined at the date of deposit the prices at which the bonds deposited in the trusts would have been offered to the public on the business day prior to the date of deposit were determined by the trustee on the basis of an evaluation of such bonds prepared by kenny sp evaluation services a division of j j kenny co inc kenny sp a firm regularly engaged in the business of evaluating quoting or appraising comparable bonds with respect to bonds in insured trusts and insured bonds in traditional trusts kenny sp evaluated the bonds as so insured see why and how are the bonds insured the amount by which the trustees determination of the offering prices of the bonds deposited in the trusts was greater or less than the cost of such bonds to the sponsor was profit or loss to the sponsor exclusive of any underwriting profit see part a of this prospectus the sponsor also may realize further profit or sustain further loss as a result of fluctuations in the public offering price of the units cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the settlement date for a purchase of units or prior to the acquisition of all portfolio securities by a trust may be available for use in the sponsors business and may be of benefit to the sponsor what is the tax status of unitholders at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities in addition with respect to state trusts where applicable bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest on such bonds when held by residents of the state in which the issuers of such bonds are located from state income taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes for a discussion of the tax status of state trusts see part a of this prospectus neither the sponsor nor chapman and cutler has made any special review for the trusts of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the basis for the opinions rendered in connection therewith if the interest on a bond should be determined to be taxable the bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount in addition investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date of which interest is determined to be taxable federally taxexempt income including income on units of the trusts will be taken into consideration in computing the portion if any of social security benefits received that will be included in a taxpayers gross income subject to the federal income tax  gain realized on the sale or redemption of the bonds by the trustee or of a unit by a unitholder is includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax purposes such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of taxexempt accrued interest or accrued original issue discount if any sections  and  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code provide a complex set of rules governing the accrual of original issue discount these rules provide that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the bond depending on the date the bond was issued in addition special rules apply if the purchase price of a bond exceeds the original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued based upon its issue price its adjusted issue price to prior owners if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the bond if a bond is purchased for a premium the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the bond bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the bond and the tax basis of the bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year the application of these rules will also vary depending on the value of the bond on the date a unitholder acquires his units and the price the unitholder pays for his units unitholders should consult with their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application the revenue reconciliation act of  the tax act subjects taxexempt bonds to the market discount rules of the code effective for bonds purchased after april   in general market discount is the amount if any by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an investors purchase price except to the extent that such difference if any is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued subject to a statutory de minimis rule market discount can arise based on the price the trust pays for the bonds or the price a unitholder pays for his or her units under the tax act accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income under prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain market discount that accretes while the trust holds a bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the unitholders when principal payments are received on the bond upon sale or at redemption including early redemption or upon the sale or redemption of his or her units unless a unitholder elects to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues the market discount rules are complex and unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding these rules and their application in the opinion of chapman and cutler counsel to the sponsor under existing law  the trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue discount on bonds which is excludable from gross income under the code will retain its status when distributed to the unitholders however such interest may be taken into account in computing the alternative minimum tax an additional tax on branches of foreign corporations and the environmental tax the superfund tax see certain tax matters applicable to corporate unitholders below  each unitholder of a trust is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of such trust under subpart e subchapter j of chapter  of the code and will have a taxable event when the trust disposes of a bond or when the unitholder redeems or sells units unitholders must reduce the tax basis of their units for their share of accrued interest received by the trust if any on bonds delivered after the unitholders pay for their units to the extent that such interest accrued on such bonds before the date the trust acquired ownership of the bonds and the amount of this reduction may exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller during the period from the unitholders settlement date to the date such bonds are delivered to the respective trusts and consequently such unitholders may have an increase in taxable gain or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such units gain or loss upon the sale or redemption of units is measured by comparing the proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the units if the trustee disposes of bonds whether by sale payment at maturity redemption or otherwise gain or loss is recognized to the unitholder the amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the unitholders pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with the unitholders basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset disposed of in the case of a unitholder who purchases units such basis before adjustment for earned original issue discount and amortized bond premium if any is determined by apportioning the cost of the units among each of the trust assets ratably according to value as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the units the tax basis reduction requirements of said code relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in the unitholder realizing a taxable gain when his or her units are sold or redeemed for an amount less than or equal to their original cost and  any amounts paid on defaulted bonds held by the trustee under policies of insurance issued with respect to such bonds will be excludable from federal gross income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds paragraph  of this opinion is accordingly applicable to policy proceeds representing maturing interest  in the opinion of carter ledyard  milburn counsel to the trustee and in the absence of a new york trust from the series special counsel for the series for new york tax matters under existing law under the income tax laws of the state and city of new york each trust is not an association taxable as a corporation and the income of each trust will be treated as the income of the unitholders for a summary of each opinion of special counsel to the respective state trusts for state tax matters see part a of this prospectus all statements in the prospectus concerning exclusion from gross income for federal state or other tax purposes are the opinion of counsel and are to be so construed counsel for the sponsor has also advised that under section  of the code interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units of a trust is not deductible for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue service has taken the position that such indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying of units however these rules generally do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence also under section  of the code certain financial institutions that acquire units would generally not be able to deduct any of the interest expense attributable to ownership of such units on december   the us treasury department released proposed legislation that if enacted would generally extend the financial institution rules to all corporations effective for obligations acquired after the date of announcement investors with questions regarding this issue should consult with their tax advisers in the case of certain of the bonds in the trust the opinions of bond counsel indicate that interest on such bonds received by a substantial user of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these bonds or persons related thereto for periods while such bonds are held by such a user or related person will not be excludable from federal gross income although interest on such bonds received by others would be excludable from federal gross income substantial user and related person are defined under the code and us treasury regulations any person who believes that he or she may be a substantial user or a related person as so defined should contact his or her tax adviser for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations interest on certain specified taxexempt private activity bonds is included as a preference item the trusts do not include any such bonds certain tax matters applicable to corporate unitholders in the case of certain corporations the alternative minimum tax and the superfund tax depend upon the corporations alternative minimum taxable income amti which is the corporations taxable income with certain adjustments one of the adjustment items used in computing amti and the superfund tax of a corporation other than an s corporation regulated investment company real estate investment trust or remic is an amount equal to  of the excess of such corporations adjusted current earnings over an amount equal to its amti before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating loss deduction adjusted current earnings includes all taxexempt interest including interest on all bonds in the trust under current code provisions the superfund tax does not apply to tax years beginning on or after january   however the superfund tax could be extended retroactively under the provisions of section  of the code a branch profits tax is levied on the effectively connected earnings and profits of certain foreign corporations which include taxexempt interest such as interest on the bonds in the trust unitholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences to them including the corporate alternative minimum tax the superfund tax and the branch profits tax imposed by section  of the code ownership of the units may result in collateral federal income tax consequences to certain taxpayers including without limitation corporations subject to either the environmental tax or the branch profits tax financial institutions certain insurance companies certain s corporations individual recipients of social security or railroad retirement benefits and taxpayers who may be deemed to have incurred or continued indebtedness to purchase or carry taxexempt obligations prospective investors should consult their tax advisers as to the applicability of any such collateral consequences except as noted above and in part a of this prospectus the exemption of interest on state and local obligations for federal income tax purposes discussed above does not necessarily result in exemption under the income or other tax laws of any state or city the laws of the several states vary with respect to the taxation of such obligations what are normal trust operating expenses no annual advisory fee is charged to the trusts by the sponsor the sponsor does however receive a fee as set forth in essential information in part a of this prospectus for regularly evaluating the bonds and for maintaining surveillance over the portfolio see unit value and evaluation the trustee receives for ordinary recurring services an annual fee for each plan of distribution for each trust as set forth in essential information appearing in part a of this prospectus each annual fee is per  principal amount of the underlying bonds in a trust for that portion of the trust that represents a particular plan of distribution the trustees fee may be periodically adjusted in response to fluctuations in shortterm interest rates reflecting the cost to the trustee of advancing funds to a trust to meet scheduled distributions and may be further adjusted in accordance with the

these funds premiums for the policies of insurance obtained by the sponsor or by the bond issuers with respect to the bonds in the insured trusts and with respect to insured bonds in traditional trusts have been paid in full prior to the deposit of the bonds in the trusts and the value of such insurance has been included in the evaluation of the bonds in each trust and accordingly in the

expense of the trust by independent public accountants selected by the sponsor the trustee shall not be required however to cause such an audit to be performed if its cost to a trust shall exceed  per unit on an annual basis unitholders of a trust covered by an audit may obtain a copy of the audited financial statements upon request when are distributions made to unitholders interest received by the trustee on the bonds in each trust including that part of the proceeds of any disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest and including any insurance proceeds representing interest due on defaulted bonds shall be credited to the interest account of such trust and all other moneys received by the trustee shall be credited to the principal account of such trust the pro rata share of cash in the principal account in each trust will be computed as of each semiannual record date and distributions to the unitholders as of such record date will be made on or shortly after the fifteenth day of the month proceeds received from the disposition including sale call or maturity of any of the bonds and all amounts paid with respect to zero coupon bonds and stripped obligations will be held in the principal account and either used to pay for units redeemed or distributed on the distribution date following the next semiannual record date the trustee is not required to make a distribution from the principal account of any trust unless the amount available for distribution in such account equals at least ten cents per unit the pro rata share of the interest account in each trust will be computed by the trustee each month as of each record date and distributions will be made on or shortly after the fifteenth day of the month to unitholders of such trust as of the record date who are entitled to distributions at that time under the plan of distribution chosen persons who purchase units between a record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the distribution date following the next record date under the applicable plan of distribution purchasers of units who desire to receive interest distributions on a monthly or quarterly basis may elect to do so at the time of purchase during the initial public offering period those indicating no choice will be deemed to have chosen the semiannual distribution plan all unitholders however who purchase units during the initial public offering period and who hold them of record on the first record date will receive the first distribution of interest thereafter record dates for monthly distributions will be the first day of each month record dates for quarterly distributions will be the first day of february may august and november and record dates for semiannual distributions will be the first day of may and november see part a of this prospectus for details of distributions per unit of each trust under the various plans based upon estimated net annual interest income at the date of deposit the amount of the regular distributions will generally change when bonds are redeemed mature or are sold or when fees and expenses increase or decrease for the purpose of minimizing fluctuations in the distributions from the interest account of a trust the trustee is authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary to provide for interest distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee shall be reimbursed without interest for any such advances from funds in the interest account of such trust the trustees fee takes into account the costs attributable to the outlay of capital needed to make such advances the plan of distribution selected by a unitholder will remain in effect until changed unitholders purchasing units in the secondary market will initially receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior owner unitholders  desiring to change their plan of distribution may do so by sending a written notice requesting the change together with any certificates to the trustee the notice and any certificates must be received by the trustee not later than the semiannual record date to be effective as of the semiannual distribution

certified mail to minimize the possibility of their being lost or stolen see ownership and transfer of units as of the first day of each month the trustee will deduct from the interest account of a trust or to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the principal account of a trust amounts needed for payment of expenses of such trust the trustee also may withdraw from said accounts such amount if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of such trust amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trusts assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate account in addition the trustee shall withdraw from the interest account and the principal account of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemptions of units of such trust by the trustee funds which are available for future distributions redemptions and payment of expenses are held in accounts which

mutual funds the accumulation funds into which unitholders may choose to reinvest trust distributions unitholders may elect to reinvest principal distributions or interest and principal distributions automatically without any sales charge each accumulation fund has investment objectives which differ in certain respects from those of the trusts and may invest in securities which would not be eligible for deposit in the trusts further information concerning the accumulation plan and a list of accumulation funds is set forth in the information supplement of this prospectus which may be obtained by contacting the trustee at the phone number listed on the back cover of this prospectus participants may at any time by so notifying the trustee in writing elect to change the accumulation fund into which their distributions are being reinvested to change from principal only reinvestment to reinvestment of both principal and interest or vice versa or to terminate their participation in the accumulation plan altogether and receive future distributions on their units in cash there will be no charge or other penalty for such change of election or termination the character of trust distributions for income tax purposes will remain unchanged even if they are reinvested in an accumulation fund how detailed are reports to unitholders the trustee shall furnish unitholders of a trust in connection with each distribution a statement of the amount of interest if any and the amount of other receipts received since the preceding distribution being distributed expressed in each case as a dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each unit of a trust outstanding and a year to date summary of all distributions paid on said units within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year the trustee shall furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a registered unitholder of a trust a statement with respect to such trust i as to the interest account interest received including amounts representing interest received upon any disposition of bonds and except for any state trust the percentage of such interest by states in which the issuers of the bonds are located deductions for fees and expenses of such trust redemption of units and the balance remaining after such distributions and deductions expressed in each case both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each unit outstanding on the last business day of such calendar year ii as to the principal account the dates of disposition of any bonds and the net proceeds received therefrom excluding any portion representing accrued interest the amount paid for purchase of replacement bonds the amount paid upon redemption of units deductions for payment of applicable taxes and fees and expenses of the trustee and the balance remaining after such distributions and deductions expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each unit outstanding on the last business day of such calendar year iii a list of the bonds held and the number of units outstanding on the last business day of such calendar year iv the unit value based upon the last computation thereof made during such calendar year and v amounts actually distributed during such calendar year from the interest account and from the principal account separately stated expressed both as total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts representing the pro rata share of each unit outstanding each annual statement will reflect pertinent information in respect of all plans of distribution so that unitholders may be informed regarding the results of other plans of distribution unit value and evaluation the value of each trust is determined by the sponsor on the basis of  the cash on hand in the trust or moneys in the process of being collected  the value of the bonds in the trust based on the bid prices of the bonds and  interest accrued thereon not subject to collection less  amounts representing taxes or governmental charges payable out of the trust and  the accrued expenses of the trust the result of such computation is divided by the number of units of such trust outstanding as of the date thereof to determine the per unit value unit value of such trust the sponsor may determine the value of the bonds in each trust  on the basis of current bid prices of the bonds obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by a trust  if bid prices are not available for any of the bonds on the basis of bid prices for comparable bonds  by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others  engaged in the practice of evaluating quoting or appraising comparable bonds or  by any combination of the above although the unit value of each trust is based on the bid prices of the bonds the units are sold initially to the public at the public offering price based on the offering prices of the bonds because the insurance obtained by the sponsor or by the issuers of bonds with respect to the bonds in the insured trusts and with respect to insured bonds in traditional trusts is effective so long as such bonds are outstanding such insurance will be taken into account in determining the bid and offering prices of such bonds and therefore some value attributable to such insurance will be included in the value of units of trusts that include such bonds how units of the trusts are distributed to the public nuveen in addition to being the sponsor is the sole underwriter of the units it is the intention of the sponsor to qualify units of national long intermediate intermediate short intermediate and short term trusts for sale under the laws of substantially all of the states of the united states of america and units of state trusts only in the state for which the trust is named and selected other states promptly following the deposit of bonds in exchange for units of the trusts it is the practice of the sponsor to place all of the units as collateral for a letter or letters of credit from one or more commercial banks under an agreement to release such units from time to time as needed for distribution under such an arrangement the sponsor pays such banks compensation based on the then current interest rate this is a normal warehousing arrangement during the period of distribution of the units to public investors to facilitate the handling of transactions sales of units shall be limited to transactions involving a minimum of either  or  units whichever is less the sponsor reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units the sponsor plans to allow a discount to brokers and dealers in connection with the primary distribution of units and also in secondary market transactions the primary market discounts are as follows discount per unit  national long inter short inter and state mediate intermediate mediate short term number of units trusts trusts trusts trusts trusts       less than        but less than        but less than        but less than        but less than

purchased using the equivalent of  units to   units to  etc and will be applied on that basis which is more favorable to the purchaser the sponsor currently intends to maintain a secondary market for units of each trust see market for units the amount of the dealer concession on secondary market purchases of trust units through the sponsor will be computed based upon the value of the bonds in the trust portfolio including the sales charge computed as described in how is the public offering price determined and adjusted to reflect the cash position of the trust principal account and will vary with the size of the purchase as shown in the following table amount of purchase        under to to to to to to  years to maturity        or more          less than           but less than

that basis which is more favorable to the purchaser the sponsor reserves the right to change the foregoing dealer concessions from time to time at the discretion of the sponsor volume incentives can be earned as a marketing allowance by dealer firms who reach cumulative firm sales or sales arrangement levels of a specified number of units of an individual trust during the primary  offering period as set forth in the table below for firms that meet the necessary volume level for a trust volume incentives may be given on all trades involving that trust originated from or by that firm during the primary offering period primary market volume incentives per trust sales level average maturity during the primary volume incentive of trust offering period per unit    less than  years at least

secondary market sales of at least  million of nuveen unit trust units per calendar quarter only sales through the sponsor qualify for volume incentives and for meeting minimum requirements the sponsor reserves the right to modify or change the volume incentive schedule at any time and make the determination as to which firms qualify for the marketing allowance and the amount paid registered investment advisers certified financial planners and registered brokerdealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for financial planning investment advisory or asset management services or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which a comprehensive wrap fee charge is imposed and bank trust departments investing funds over which they exercise exclusive discretionary investment authority and that are held in a fiduciary agency custodial or similar capacity are not entitled to receive any dealer concession for any sales made to investors which qualified as discounted purchases during the primary or secondary market see how is the public offering price determined certain commercial banks are making units of the trusts available to their customers on an agency basis a portion of the sales charge paid by these customers is retained by or remitted to the banks in the amounts shown in the above table the glasssteagall act prohibits banks from underwriting trust units the act does however permit certain agency transactions and banking regulators have not indicated that these particular agency transactions are not permitted under the act in texas and in certain other states any bank making units available must be registered as a brokerdealer under state law ownership and transfer of units the ownership of units is evidenced by book entry positions recorded on the books and records of the trustee unless the unitholder expressly requests that the purchased units be evidenced in certificate form the trustee is authorized to treat as the owner of units that person who at the time is registered as such on the books of the trustee any unitholder who holds a certificate may change to book entry ownership by submitting to the trustee the certificate along with a written request that the units represented by such certificate be held in book entry form likewise a unitholder who holds units in book entry form may obtain a certificate for such units by written request to the trustee units may be held in denominations of one unit or any multiple or fraction thereof fractions of units are computed to three decimal places any certificates issued will be numbered serially for identification and are issued in fully registered form transferable only on the books of the trustee book entry unitholders will receive a book entry position confirmation reflecting their ownership for trusts allowing optional plans of distribution certificates for units will bear an appropriate notation on their face indicating which plan of distribution has been selected when a change is made the existing certificates must be surrendered to the trustee and new certificates issued to reflect the currently effective plan of distribution there will be no charge for this service holders of book entry units can change their plan of distribution by making a written request to the trustee which will issue a new book entry position confirmation to reflect such change units are transferable by making a written request to the trustee and in the case of units evidenced by certificates by presenting and surrendering such certificates to the trustee at its address listed on the back cover of this part b of the prospectus properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer the certificates should be sent registered or certified mail for the protection of the unitholder each unitholder must sign such written request and such certificates or transfer instrument exactly as his name appears on a the face of the certificates representing the units to be transferred or b the book entry position confirmations relating to the units to be transferred such signatures must be guaranteed by a guarantor acceptable to the trustee in certain instances the trustee may require additional documents such as but not limited to trust instruments certificates of death appointments as executor or administrator or certificates of corporate authority mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the trustee in order for a replacement certificate to be issued although at the date hereof no charge is made and none is contemplated a unitholder may be required to pay  to the trustee for each certificate reissued or transfer of units requested and to pay any governmental charge which may be imposed in connection therewith replacement of lost stolen or destroyed certificates to obtain a new certificate replacing one that has been lost stolen or destroyed the unitholder must furnish the trustee with sufficient indemnification and pay such expenses as the trustee may incur this indemnification must be in the  form of an open penalty bond of indemnification the premium for such an indemnity bond may vary but currently amounts to  of the market value of the units represented by the certificate in the case however of a trust as to which notice of termination has been given the premium currently amounts to  of the market value of the units represented by such certificate how units may be redeemed without charge unitholders may redeem all or a portion of their units by  making a written request for such redemption book entry unitholders may use the redemption form on the reverse side of their book entry position confirmation to the trustee at its address listed on the back cover of this part b of the prospectus redemptions of  units or more will require a signature guarantee  in the case of units evidenced by a certificate by also tendering such certificate to the trustee duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with signatures guaranteed as explained above or provide satisfactory indemnity required in connection with lost stolen or destroyed certificates and  payment of applicable governmental charges if any certificates should be sent only by registered or certified mail to minimize the possibility of their being lost or stolen see ownership and transfer of units no redemption fee will be charged a unitholder may authorize the trustee to honor telephone instructions for the redemption of units held in book entry form units represented by certificates may not be redeemed by telephone the proceeds of units redeemed by telephone will be sent by check either to the unitholder at the address specified on his account or to a financial institution specified by the unitholder for credit to the account of the unitholder a unitholder wishing to use this method of redemption must complete a telephone redemption authorization form and furnish the form to the trustee telephone redemption authorization forms can be obtained from a unitholders registered representative or by calling the trustee once the completed form is on file the trustee will honor telephone redemption requests by any authorized person the time a telephone redemption request is received determines the date of tender as discussed below the redemption proceeds will be mailed within three business days following the telephone redemption request only units held in the name of individuals may be redeemed by telephone accounts registered in broker name or accounts of corporations or fiduciaries including among others trustees guardians executors and administrators may not use the telephone redemption privilege on the third business day following the date of tender the unitholder will be entitled to receive in cash for each unit tendered an amount equal to the unit value of such trust determined by the trustee as of  pm eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time on the date of tender as defined hereafter plus accrued interest to but not including the third business day after the date of tender redemption price the price received upon redemption may be more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the bonds on the date of tender unitholders should check with the trustee or their broker to determine the redemption price before tendering units the date of tender is deemed to be the date on which the request for redemption of units is received in proper form by the trustee except that as regards a redemption request received after  pm eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time or on any day on which the exchange is normally closed the date of tender is the next day on which such exchange is normally open for trading and such request will be deemed to have been made on such day and the redemption will be effected at the redemption price computed on that day accrued interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the interest account of the appropriate trust or if the balance therein is insufficient from the principal account of such trust all other amounts paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the principal account the trustee is empowered to sell underlying bonds of a trust in order to make funds available for redemption see how bonds may be removed from the trusts units so redeemed shall be cancelled to the extent that bonds are sold from a trust the size and diversity of such trust will be reduced such sales may be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized the redemption price is determined on the basis of the bid prices of the bonds in each trust while the initial public offering price of units will be determined on the basis of the offering prices of the bonds as of  pm eastern time on any day on which the exchange is normally open for trading or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time and such determination is made as of any given time the difference between the bid and offering prices of such bonds may be expected to average  to  of principal amount in the case of actively traded bonds the difference may be as little as  to  of  and in the case of inactively traded bonds such difference usually will not exceed  the right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period during which the securities and exchange commission determines that trading in the municipal bond market is restricted or an emergency exists as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable or for such other periods as the securities and exchange commission may by order permit under regulations issued by the internal revenue service the trustee will be required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholders tax identification number in the manner required by such regulations any amount so withheld is transmitted to the internal  revenue service and may be recovered by the unitholder only when filing his or her tax return under normal circumstances the trustee obtains the unitholders tax identification number from the selling broker at the time the certificate or book entry return confirmation is issued and this number is printed on the certificate or book entry return confirmation and on distribution statements if a unitholders tax identification number does not appear as described above or if it is incorrect the unitholder should contact the trustee before redeeming units to determine what action if any is required to avoid this backup withholding how units may be purchased by the sponsor the trustee will notify the sponsor of any tender of units for redemption if the sponsors bid in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the redemption price it may purchase such units by notifying the trustee before the close of business on the second succeeding business day and by making payment therefor to the unitholder not later than the day on which payment would otherwise have been made by the trustee see how units may be redeemed without charge the sponsors current practice is to bid at the redemption price in the secondary market units held by the sponsor may be tendered to the trustee for redemption as any other units how bonds may be removed from the trusts bonds will be removed from a trust as they mature or are redeemed by the issuers thereof see part a of this prospectus and risk factors for a discussion of call provisions of portfolio bonds the indenture also empowers the trustee to sell bonds for the purpose of redeeming units tendered by any unitholder and for the payment of expenses for which income may not be available under the indenture the sponsor is obligated to provide the trustee with a current list of bonds in each trust to be sold in such circumstances in deciding which bonds should be sold the sponsor intends to consider among other things such factors as  market conditions  market prices of the bonds  the effect on income distributions to unitholders of the sale of various bonds  the effect on principal amount of underlying bonds per unit of the sale of various bonds  the financial condition of the issuers and  the effect of the sale of various bonds on the investment character of the trust such sales if required could result in the sale of bonds by the trustee at prices less than original cost to the trust to the extent bonds are sold the size and diversity of such trust will be reduced in addition the sponsor is empowered to direct the trustee to liquidate bonds upon the happening of certain other events such as default in the payment of principal andor interest an action

part a of this prospectus the trusts may contain or be concentrated in one or more of the types of bonds discussed below the following paragraphs discuss certain circumstances which may adversely affect the ability of issuers of bonds held in the portfolio of a trust to make payment of principal and interest thereon or which may adversely affect the ratings of such bonds with respect to insured trusts however because of the insurance obtained by the sponsor or by the issuers of the bonds such changes should not adversely affect an insured trusts receipt of principal and interest the

medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs medicare reimbursements are currently calculated on a prospective basis and are not based on a providers actual costs such method of reimbursement may adversely affect reimbursements to hospitals and other facilities for services provided under the medicare program and thereby may have an adverse effect on the ability of such institutions to satisfy debt service requirements in the event of a default upon a bond secured by hospital facilities the limited alternative uses for such facilities may result in the recovery upon such collateral not providing sufficient funds to fully repay the bonds certain hospital bonds provide for redemption at par upon the damage destruction or condemnation of the hospital facilities or in other special circumstances single family and multifamily housing revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from mortgage loans to housing projects for the elderly or for low to moderate income families such issues are generally characterized by mandatory redemption at par or in the case of original issue discount bonds accreted value in the event of economic defaults and in the event of a failure of the operator of a project to comply with certain covenants as to the operation of the project the failure of such operator to comply with certain covenants related to the taxexempt status of interest on the bonds such as provisions requiring that a specified percentage of units be rented or available for rental to low or moderate income families potentially could cause interest on such bonds to be subject to federal income taxation from the date of issuance of the bonds the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments will be affected by events and conditions affecting financed projects including among other things the achievement and maintenance of sufficient occupancy levels and adequate rental income employment and income conditions prevailing in local labor markets increases in taxes utility costs and other operating expenses the managerial ability of project managers changes in laws and governmental regulations the appropriation of subsidies and social and economic trends affecting the localities in which the projects are located occupancy of such housing projects may be adversely affected by high rent levels and income limitations imposed under federal and state programs single family mortgage revenue bonds some of the bonds in a trust may be single family mortgage revenue bonds which are issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period the redemption price of such issues may be more or less than the offering price of such bonds additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue  bonds single family mortgage revenue bonds issued after december   were issued under section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended or section  of the internal revenue code of  which sections contain certain requirements relating to the use of the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its taxexempt status in each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that such continuing requirements will be satisfied the failure to meet such requirements could cause interest on the bonds to be subject to federal income taxation possibly from the date of issuance of the bonds congregate care revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from loans to finance the construction andor acquisition of congregate care facilities including retirement facilities and nursing care units a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events

revenue obligations and congregate care revenue bonds the obligations in a trust may be insured by the federal housing administration fha under fha regulations the maximum insurable mortgage amount cannot exceed  of the fhas estimated value of the project the fha mortgage insurance does not constitute a guarantee of timely payment of the principal of and interest on the obligations payment of mortgage insurance benefits may be  less than the principal amount of obligations outstanding or  delayed if disputes arise as to the amount of the payment or if certain notices are not given to the fha within the prescribed time periods in addition some of the previously discussed obligations may be secured by mortgagebacked certificates guaranteed by the government national mortgage association gnma a wholly owned corporate instrumentality of the united states andor the federal national mortgage association fannie mae a federally chartered and stockholderowed corporation gnma and fannie mae guarantee timely payment of principal and interest on the mortgagebacked certificates even where the underlying mortgage payments are not made while such mortgagebacked certificates are often pledged to secure payment of principal and interest on the obligations timely payment of interest and principal on the obligations is not insured or guaranteed by the united states gnma fannie mae or any other governmental agency or instrumentality the gnma mortgagebacked certificates constitute a general obligation of the united states backed by its full faith and credit the obligations of fannie mae including its obligations under the fannie mae mortgagebacked securities are obligations solely of fannie mae and are not backed by or entitled to the full faith and credit of the united states public housing authority revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from loans to finance public housing projects these bonds are guaranteed by the federal department of housing and urban development such issues are generally characterized by mandatory redemption at par or in the case of original issue discount bonds accreted

achievement and maintenance of sufficient occupancy levels employment and income conditions prevailing in local labor markets increases in taxes utility costs and other operating expenses changes in laws and governmental regulations and social and economic trends affecting the localities in which the projects are located in addition the federal department of housing and urban development may impose regulations andor limitations which may have an adverse impact on the bonds in a trust industrial revenue obligations certain of the bonds in a trust may be industrial revenue bonds irbs which are taxexempt securities issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various industrial projects these projects are usually operated by corporate entities issuers are obligated only to pay amounts due on the irbs to the extent that funds are available from the unexpended proceeds of the irbs or receipts or revenues of the issuer under an arrangement between the issuer and the corporate operator of a project the arrangement may be in the form of a lease installment sale agreement conditional sale agreement or loan agreement but in each case the payments to the issuer are designed to be sufficient to meet the payments of amounts due on the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and if applicable corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may  result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may have an impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected the irbs in a trust may be subject to special or extraordinary redemption provisions which may provide for redemption at par or in the case of original issue discount bonds accreted value the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of irbs in a trust prior to the stated maturity of such bonds power revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from pollution control bonds as well as the sale of electric energy and oil and gas some of these obligations are backed by the credit of an investor owned utility iou the problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the applicable public utility commissions the difficulty of financing large construction programs increased competition reductions in estimates of future demand for electricity in certain areas of the country the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds in a trust to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds utility obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of natural gas or the combined net revenue of two or more municipal utility systems operating as a single entity the problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the applicable public utility commissions the difficulty of financing large construction programs increased competition reductions in estimates of future demands for natural gas in certain areas of the country the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds in a trust to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds transportation bonds some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of airports public transit systems and ports the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for airport use occupancy of certain terminal space service fees and leases airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements the air transport industry is experiencing significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints and other factors and several airlines are experiencing severe financial difficulties in particular facilities with use agreements involving airlines experiencing financial difficulty may experience a reduction in revenue due to the possible inability of these airlines to meet their use agreement obligations because of such financial difficulties and possible bankruptcy the sponsor cannot predict what effect these industry conditions may have on airport revenues which are dependent for payment on the financial condition of the airlines and their usage of the particular airport facility bonds that are secured primarily by the revenue collected by a public transit system typically are additionally secured by a pledge of sales tax receipts collected at the state or local level or of other governmental financial assistance transit system net revenues will be affected by variations in utilization which in turn may be affected by the degree of local governmental subsidization demographic and population shifts and competition from other forms of transportation and by increased costs including costs resulting from previous deferrals of maintenance port authorities derive their revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the facilities the rate of utilization of such facilities may fluctuate depending on the local economy and on competition from competing forms of transportation such as air rail and trucks water andor sewerage revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees  resource recovery revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of sewerage or solid waste disposal services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees education revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems of such issuers include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees bridge and tollroad revenue obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers which derive their payments from bridge road or tunnel toll revenues the revenues of such an issuer could be adversely affected by competition from tollfree vehicular bridges and roads and alternative modes of transportation such revenues could also be adversely affected by a reduction in the availability of fuel to motorists or significant increases in the costs thereof specifically governmental regulations restricting the use of vehicles in the new york city metropolitan area may adversely affect revenues of the triborough bridge and tunnel authority dedicatedtax supported revenue bonds some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by tax revenues from a designated source which revenues are pledged to secure the bonds the various types of bonds described below differ in structure and with respect to the rights of the bondholders to the underlying property each type of dedicatedtax supported bond has distinct risks only some of which are set forth below one type of dedicatedtax supported bond is secured by the incremental tax received on either real property or on sales within a specifically defined geographical area such tax generally will not provide bondholders with a lien on the underlying property or revenues another type of dedicatedtax supported bond is secured by a special tax levied on real property within a defined geographical area in such a manner that the tax is levied on those who benefit from the project such bonds typically provide for a statutory lien on the underlying property for unpaid taxes a third type of dedicatedtax supported bond may be secured by a tax levied upon the manufacture sale or consumption of commodities or upon the license to pursue certain occupations or upon corporate privileges within a taxing jurisdiction as to any of these types of bonds the ability of the designated revenues to satisfy the interest and principal payments on such bonds may be affected by changes in the local economy the financial success of the enterprise responsible for the payment of the taxes the value of any property on which taxes may be assessed and the ability to collect such taxes in a timely fashion each of these factors will have a different affect on each distinct type of dedicatedtax supported bonds municipal lease revenue bonds some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity such payments are normally subject to annual budget appropriations of the leasing governmental entity a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby special obligation to crossover some of the bonds in a trust may be issued with the intention of crossover refunding an outstanding issue at a future date these bonds are secured to the crossover date by us government securities purchased with the proceeds of the refunding bonds the revenues of such an issuer could be adversely affected by problems associated with the outstanding issue economic social and environmental policies and conditions that are not within the control of the issuer and governmental policies and regulations affecting the issuer civic organization obligations some of the bonds in a trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the pledge of civic organizations including their assets the problems faced by such issuers include the ability to collect pledges made the unpredictable nature of an organizations composition and participation the quality and skill of management increased costs and delays attributable to organizations expenses and legislation regarding certain organizational purposes original issue discount bonds and stripped obligations certain of the bonds in a trust may be original issue discount bonds these bonds were issued with nominal interest rates less than the rates then offered by comparable securities and as a consequence were originally sold at a discount from their face or par values this original issue discount the difference between the initial purchase price and face value is deemed under current law to accrue on a  daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxexempt interest income for federal income tax purposes on sale or redemption gain if any realized in excess of the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital gain see what is the tax status of unitholders the current value of an original issue discount bond reflects the present value of its face amount at maturity in a stable interest rate environment the market value of an original issue discount bond would tend to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bond approached maturity certain of the original issue discount bonds in a trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds do not provide for the payment of any current interest the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment of the face amount of the bond at its maturity the effect of owning a zero coupon bond is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of the obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield but at the same time also eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality that pay interest currently original issue discount bonds including zero coupon bonds may be subject to redemption at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption the accreted value plus if applicable some premium pursuant to such call provisions an original issue discount bond may be called prior to its maturity date at a price less than its face value see the schedules of investments for more information about the call provisions of portfolio bonds certain of the bonds in a trust may be stripped obligations which represent evidences of ownership with respect to either the principal amount of or a payment of interest on a taxexempt obligation an obligation is stripped by depositing it with a custodian which then effects a separation in ownership between the bond and any interest payment which has not yet become payable and issues evidences of ownership with respect to such constituent parts a stripped obligation therefore has economic characteristics similar to zero coupon bonds as described above each stripped obligation has been purchased at a discount from the amount payable at maturity with respect to each unitholder the internal revenue code treats as original issue discount that portion of the discount which produces a yield to maturity as of the date of purchase of the unitholders units equal to the lower of the coupon rate of interest on the underlying obligation or the yield to maturity on the basis of the purchase price of the unitholders units which is allocable to each stripped obligation original issue discount which accrues with respect to a stripped obligation will be exempt from federal income taxation to the same extent as interest on the underlying obligations see what is the tax status of unitholders in part b of this prospectus unitholders should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the state and local tax consequences of owning original issue discount bonds or stripped obligations under applicable provisions governing determination of state and local taxes interest on original issue discount bonds or stripped obligations may be deemed to be received in the year of accrual even though there is no corresponding cash payment why and how are the bonds insured insurance on bonds insured truststhe insurers policy unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full and complete payment required to be made by or on behalf of the issuer to the paying agent or its successor of an amount equal to i the principal of either at the stated maturity or by an advancement of maturity pursuant to a mandatory sinking fund payment and interest on the bonds as such payments shall become due but shall not be so paid except that in the event of any acceleration of the due date of such principal by reason of mandatory or optional redemption or acceleration resulting from default or otherwise other than any advancement of maturity pursuant to a mandatory sinking fund payment the payments guaranteed by the insurers policy shall be made in such amounts and at such times as such payments of principal would have been due had there not been any such acceleration and ii the reimbursement of any such payment which is subsequently recovered from any owner of the bonds pursuant to a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such payment constitutes an avoidable preference to such owner within the meaning of any applicable bankruptcy law a preference the insurers policy does not insure against loss of any prepayment premium which may at any time be payable with respect to any bond the insurers policy does not under any circumstance insure against loss relating to i optional or mandatory redemptions other than mandatory sinking fund redemptions ii any payments to be made on an accelerated basis iii payments of the purchase price of bonds upon tender by an owner thereof or iv any preference

poors corporation a description of the applicable standard  poors corporation rating symbols and their meanings follows a standard  poors rating is a current assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation this assessment may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors insurers or lessees the rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor the ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit in connection with any rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information the ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other circumstances the ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of defaultcapacity and willingness of the obligor as to the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangements under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights aaathis is the highest rating assigned by standard  poors to a debt obligation capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong aabonds rated aa have a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and differ from the highest rated issues only in small degree abonds rated a have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories bbbbonds rated bbb are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for bonds in the higher rated categories plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to bb may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories provisional ratings the letter p indicates that the rating is provisional a provisional rating assumes the successful completion of the project being financed by the issuance of the bonds being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion accordingly the investor should exercise his own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk note ratings a standard  poors note rating reflects the liquidity concerns and market access risks unique to notes notes due in  years or less will likely receive a note rating notes maturing beyond  years will most likely receive a longterm debt rating note rating symbols are as follows sp very strong or strong capacity to pay principal and interest those issues determined to possess overwhelming safety characteristics will be given a plus  designation sp satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest moodys investors service inc a brief description of the applicable moodys investors service inc rating symbols and their meanings follows aaabonds which are rated aaa are judged to be the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues their safety is so absolute that as published by the rating companies  with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances characteristically their market value is affected solely by money market fluctuations aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuations of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities their market value is virtually immune to all but money market influences with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future the market value of arated bonds may be influenced to some degree by economic performance during a sustained period of depressed business conditions but during periods of normalcy arated bonds frequently move in parallel with aaa and aa obligations with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances moodys bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic rating classification the modifier  indicates that the bond ranks at the high end of its category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category baabonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well the market value of baarated bonds is more sensitive to changes in economic circumstances and aside from occasional speculative factors applying to some bonds of this class baa market valuations move in parallel with aaa aa and a obligations during periods of economic normalcy except in instances of oversupply con bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally these are bonds secured by a earnings of projects under construction b earnings of projects unseasoned in operation experience c rentals which begin when facilities are completed or d payments to which some other limiting condition attaches parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion of construction or elimination of basis of condition note ratings mig  this designation denotes best quality there is present strong protection by established cash flows superior liquidity support or demonstrated broadbased access to the market for refinancing mig  this designation denotes high quality margins of protection are ample although not so large as in the preceding group fitch ibca inc formerly fitch investors service lp a brief description of the applicable fitch ibca inc rating symbols and their meanings follow aaabonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality the obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest and repay principal which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable events aabonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong although not quite as strong as bonds rated aaa bonds rated in the aaa and aa categories are not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable future developments abonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be strong but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances than bonds with higher ratings bbbbonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be adequate adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances however are more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds and therefore impair timely payment the likelihood that the ratings of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings to provide more detailed indications of credit quality the aa a and bbb ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within these major rating categories note ratings fin notes assigned this rating are regarded as having the strongest degree of assurance for timely payment  fin notes assigned this rating reflect a degree of assurance for timely payment only slightly less in degree than the highest category how the trust compares performance the sponsor may compare the estimated returns of the trust with the returns or yields of other taxfree and taxable investments often on a taxable equivalent basis in addition the sponsor from time to time may quote various performance measures and studies in order to compare the historical returns available from an investment in municipal securities with investments in both taxfree and taxable securities nuveen research prepared one such study which compared the aftertax value of  initially invested in  in various asset classes including municipal bonds treasury bonds and corporate bonds as indicated in the chart provided below the year study shows that municipal bonds significantly outperformed corporate and
