information you are here home  about tci  our philosophyour philosophy our goal in serving our clients is to insure that each one has a successful investment experience we have discovered in our many years of working with investors that it is not that difficult to have a successful investment experience historical data shows us that making a good investment is relatively easy so why isn’t everyone successful because making a good investment requires the management of not only an individual’s assets but more importantly their behavior most of us fail at one or the other perhaps we get excited and invest in a local startup or a real estate limited partnership because our friends say it is sure to go up maybe we have made good investment decisions but when markets get rocky we panic and sell our diversified portfolio the result in both cases is the same a poor investment experience the realization of one’s dreams does happen in some instances by pure luck however in most cases it is the result of a well thought out plan specific resources are deployed based upon solutions and strategies resulting in quantifiable success realizing success should never rest in the hands of chance or the results of shortterm economic conditions this process does not happen overnight and is most commonly the result of years of careful thought action and adjustment this process must include a strategic balance between a client’s current or future living expenses and the assets that the client wishes to preserve for future generations or philanthropic purposes a “onesize fits all” approach to goals aspirations and commitments is a sure recipe for disaster success is realized by executing a clearly defined set of strategies and solutions that result in fulfilling your promises to
