various value screens derived from our many years of sector specialization our search focuses on evaluating companies based on recurring revenues strong cash flows strategic importance management team and balance sheet quality this approach enables us to seek quality investments with attractive asymmetric riskreward characteristics independent analysis our bottomup investment approach consists of several interlocking pieces of fundamental research and analysis each potential investment opportunity undergoes extensive analysis of the quality of its recurring revenue base earnings power financial condition and valuation given the current and projected outlook a strategic competitive analysis is performed to understand the company’s strengths and weaknesses with potential catalystsevents that may unlock shareholder value identified  we meet with management teams board members industry contacts and consultants throughout the research process and constantly reevaluate our analysis both the upside and downside return scenarios are modeled to fully understand the risks associated with the investment  investment discussion each investment opportunity is scrutinized by the team with a sharp focus on downside risk we consistently ask the question “how low can it go” and a “devil’s advocate” test is always performed to understand the risks optimal entry points are established after upside and downside risk targets are determined position sizing varies upon conviction level position and portfolio management the portfolio is constantly monitored for developments that might create opportunistic trading comprehensive risk analysis is done that closely follows volatility liquidity industry exposure incremental value at risk correlation and beta diligent
