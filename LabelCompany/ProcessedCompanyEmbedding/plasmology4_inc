89 patient forms patient portal pay my bill contact us providers locations position statement orthopedic research  education position statement a position statement from the core institute regarding relationships with medical device companies recently you may have heard that the federal government completed inquiries into the practices of several large orthopedic device manufacturing companies  although the core institute was not involved in any of those investigations we would like to make sure you have accurate information regarding our relationships with some of these companies as our name suggests our physicians engineers scientists and graduate students are actively involved in clinical care education and orthopedic research  because of our mission we focus our recruitment efforts on physicians who have superior academic and clinical training and who also are actively involved in orthopedic research and education directed at advancing orthopedic surgery and improving patient outcomes  information about our physicians education training and experience can be accessed on our website at wwwthecoreinstitutecom our division of research and development and our partnership with the sun health research institute allow us to be actively involved in laboratory research aimed at improving the quality of medical care  we are currently working on projects studying total knee replacement devices ways to improve hip fracture implants improved methods of fracture treatment and release of antibiotics from implants in an attempt to reduce the risk of postoperative infections  we are very proud of our success in this field and believe that we have contributed to the improvement in the care of orthopedic conditions  because of the qualifications of our physicians and other professionals we often are approached by companies involved in the development of medical devices instruments and related equipment  the companies know that our physicians have invaluable handson experience in the treatment of orthopedic problems and that orthopedic surgeons frequently make important contributions to the development and improvement of devices and other equipment used in the treatment of orthopedic conditions  surgeons and researchers at the core institute are currently working with at least half a dozen companies both large and very small to help them create and improve products for patient care  we also have developed and patented products of our own that we have andor will license or sell to industry  although core physicians donate a great deal of their time to the advancement of orthopedic research and education they also enter into contracts that provide payment for some of their efforts  payment for the services provided by orthopedic surgeons may come in the form of hourly consulting fees for services provided by the physicians royalties based on sales of products to which core physicians made important contributions excluding sales of products used on our patients andor outright purchase of technologies  all of these transactions are compliant with all federal and state laws the following is a current list of the core physicians who have contractual relationships with device manufacturers and the companies with whom they have those relationships physician company name website the core institute safe independence llc
