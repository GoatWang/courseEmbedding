our first quarter conference call ill begin todays call by providing an overview of our performance for the quarter and well then discuss the progress that we are making on our goals for  and the longterm oded will follow with a review of our financial results and steve is here as well to answer questions we are pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter while it was challenging from a topline perspective our merchandise margin expansion and solid expense management helped to deliver favorable bottomline results which improved  to a loss of  we achieved this during a difficult selling environment which included a shift in our own marketing calendar that i will describe shortly as you have probably already heard from many retailers there were several factors that put pressure on sales during the first quarter i have to start with weather because it had a major impact on us as it disrupted sales especially in the south central and southeast parts of the country some of our stores were closed for extended periods as various government officials deemed road conditions unsafe kentucky where we have  stores was a good example of this and turned out to be our worst performing state for the quarter we have  stores on the mexican border and as most of you know these are some of our highest volume stores sales in those stores suffered as a result of the strong dollar the weaker peso has made discretionary spending in the us much more expensive for our loyal mexican national customers delays created by the west coast port strike also had some effect on our first quarter business specifically in footwear then of course there is the question of energy and whether the loss of jobs is impacting us or whether lower gas prices are offsetting any drop in employment it continues to be difficult to measure or pinpoint the answer to that question if you exclude our border stores our texas sales were better than our overall company average stores in many cities whose economies are driven by oil drilling such as odessa and midland were weaker but the strongest area in the company in the first quarter was houston so i guess the answer is that its impossible to make a conclusive call at this time my opinion for what its worth is that it is somewhat of a headwind in specific energy areas but not nearly as severe as has been suggested with regard to the change in the timing of our advertising for mothers day we saw an opportunity to increase mothers day sales and intentionally made a shift in our marketing calendar from the end of the first quarter to the start of the second quarter this marketing shift created huge excitement at our stores and clearly paid off because it generated record sales for the mothers day week as i mentioned in our press release our yeartodate comp sales were positive for the first  weeks of the year going back to first quarter cosmetics and home were the best categories while mens and accessories were the weakest some of our strongest sales were reflected in the highprofile brands such as nike calvin klein skechers estée lauder and carters activewear remains the most dominant trend up doubledigits while denim continues to be a little sluggish as you know a primary focus for us is to raise sales productivity we planned to take a greater share of our customers wallet and to accelerate growth in our directtoconsumer business this will put stage stores on a path to consistent sales and earnings growth to accomplish this we are focused on four key areas one creating a great omnichannel experience two increasing our emphasis on trends and styles three improving the store environment and four better connecting with our customers first and foremost is our directtoconsumer business which grew  during the quarter we reached a number of milestones and for the first time we had more mobile and tablet visitors than those using a desktop we launched a mobile optimized site we expanded the assortments and grew centralized fulfillment all resulting in a better customer experience i am also thrilled to announce that we strengthened our management team with the recent hiring of a new senior vice president of ecommerce mike smith mikes background includes signet jewelers home depot spiegel and the limited as we previously discussed our mission is to provide a merchandise assortment that is compelling to our customer with highprofile national brands and updated styles at a great value in cosmetics our plan this year is to roll out estée lauder and clinique counters in

compelling we are focused on improving our store environment our customer comes first and she wants an exceptional shopping experience every day as part of this key strategy we shifted capital from opening new stores to updating our existing fleet with upgrades to fixtures more mannequins comfortable fitting rooms improved lighting enhanced navigation and wider aisles our systematic remodeling program has already begun and we plan to have a small group of stores completed by the end of the second quarter as you know our plan is to update over  of our stores this year we should get a slight lift in the third quarter with the bulk of the impact being felt in the critical fourth quarter last but certainly not least we are taking steps to strengthen our connection to our customer we are focused on shifting mediums to reach her where she is that means more digital and mobile while tailoring our communications to make a more personalized connection we will also be piloting enhancements to our loyalty program in select markets later this year in addition we will continue to leverage and build upon our private label credit card with a card reissuance in time for the holidays in conclusion the first quarter on its own was challenging from a topline perspective but our margin expansion and solid expense management helped to deliver favorable bottomline results we are thrilled with our mothers day performance and definitely are on track with our expectations we are reaffirming our annual outlook of flat to positive  comparable sales growth and eps of  to  we are confident in our ability to deliver sales and earnings growth this year our entire company is focused on and excited about the strategies that we have in place there are a lot of positives in our plan for the year and we feel good about the direction of the company and the initiatives that are under way ill now turn the call over to oded oded shein  cfo secretary treasurer  executive vp thanks michael and good morning everyone net sales for the first quarter were  million comparable sales for the quarter decreased  michael identified the sales driver for the quarter but let me reiterate that the primary reason for our comp sales decline was our decision to shift our marketing calendar from q to q resulting in shifted sales and lower advertising expenses for the quarter during the quarter we saw a  increase in aur offset by a lower upt and number of transactions the gross profit rate increased  basis points compared to last years rate from continuing operations the merchandize margin component increased  basis points benefiting from the increase in aur the gross profit increase was partially offset by higher cost for buying occupancy and ecommerce reflecting our strategic investment in omnichannel technology and stores expense for the quarter decreased  million and leveraged  basis points to last year due to higher benefit from our private label credit card program lower advertising cost that shifted to the second quarter and lower store opening expense with regard to our private label credit card we continue to see strong growth during the quarter with penetration rate increasing  basis points over last years rate the net loss for the quarter was  per share  per share or  better than last years loss from continuing operations of  per share our share count for the quarter was  million and the tax rate was  moving to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with total merchandise inventories up  over last year more than half of the increase was driven by supplychain related intransit inventory as we shipped second quarter merchandise earlier this year we also had more cosmetic inventory as this year we operated  more stores with clinique and estée lauder counters on a comp basis excluding cosmetics inventory was up  borrowings under our credit facility at the end of the quarter were  million essentially flat with last year capital expenditure for the quarter net of landlord construction allowances totaled  million we opened two new stores completed one remodel and five expansions and installed cosmetic counters in one store we also closed three stores during the quarter as michael noted we are maintaining our guidance ranges for the year with comp sales between flat and up  and eps between  and a  that concludes my remarks we would now be happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator your first question is from heather balsky of bank of america your line is open heather n balsky  bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning thank you for taking my call i guess my first question you just broke out the details around inventory but i was hoping you might be able to share what inventory looks like postmothers day and then as a second question can you just give us confidence – give color around your confidence about driving comp improvement for the remainder of the year what kind of do you view as the key drivers especially in q thanks steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer hi this is steve ill take a shot at answering both questions from an inventory perspective as oded broke it down for you we gave you comp store inventory of up  so were trying to be transparent and let you know thats the inventory thats most comparable on a yearoveryear basis beneath the surface what i would tell you is that inventory is in very good shape its more forwardfacing than a year ago and quite honestly its probably in the best place its been in the three years that ive been here the delta between the  and the up  is as oded mentioned a chunk of thats obviously cosmetics inventory as we continue to open more stores which feeds the inventory base and then theres a lot of intransit in that a lot of you guys know that port issues became an issue for us and for a lot of people in the back half of last year in late third quarter fourth quarter and even bleeding into this year a little bit so we started looking at a key second quarter timing of fathers day backtoschool we did open up some shipping windows with a couple of vendors and those goods did come in from an intransit perspective but when you look at the delta between the up  and the  its comprised primarily of cosmetics and intransit which really doesnt have any sort of a markdown or margin liability associated with it in terms of what gives us confidence going forward to drive comp michael alluded to a lot of the initiatives that we put in place really they havent even started to take hold in the first quarter weve got a lot of our store updates still ahead of us as a matter of fact most of them for the year are still happening and well feel a lot of impact to that in third quarter but primarily in fourth quarter we continue to refine and update the assortment and were getting some really good wins there as we ramp up our penetration in updated and contemporary in missi so we feel like a lot of the things that we put in place as part of the long range plan are still ahead of us this year and into the next couple of years heather n balsky  bank of america merrill lynch great thank you and just one last followup with regards to the headwinds youre seeing in your border stores the reaction to the stronger dollar have you seen trends worsen from the fourth quarter how is that based into your guidance thanks michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director heather its michael i think it has actually gotten a little worse so i think as the dollar continues to get strong or frankly maybe said another way that weak peso as it continues to weaken it has hurt us theres no question about it i mean as you know those stores are normally the ones that are always outperforming and now theyre actually a drag on our comp store sales at this point and i dont know theres frankly a whole lot we can do down there at this point from that standpoint heather n balsky  bank of america merrill lynch thanks again operator your next question is from pam quintiliano with suntrust your line is open pamela quintiliano  suntrust robinson humphrey hey guys thanks so much for taking my questions so just a few quick ones for you so when we think about exposure to the energy states and the commentary on the border stores and performance does that change the way you do buys going forward or just how you yeah how you think about your inventory positioning through the remainder of the year steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer i dont know if it changes how we buy it changes how we allocate obviously so if we see stores that are not trending up to where we planned or to where it were a year ago we do shift inventory around but we certainly have a financial plan that solves back to the guidance weve given and we do buy to that and allocate based off of the performance within the season and year pamela quintiliano  suntrust robinson humphrey so the guidance youre providing what are you assuming about the health of your consumer in those energy states given its so important for you guys steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer i think michael addressed it in his comments i mean i think we see contrary information in the data right you look at it and you say texas is the most impacted state within that we have seen areas like odessa and midland where clearly its having an impact but houston also has a lot of energyrelated business around it its the one of our best performing districts so i think michael alluded to the fact if you ask any member of the management team we probably all think that theres probably somewhat of a headwind there it doesnt seem as great as its been suggested we feel like theres been other factors that impeded our progress in first quarter some of which we created for ourselves like the marketing shifts some of which were out of our control like weather but i think weve got the appropriate caution built into our plan going forward based off of what were seeing in the business right now michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director the other comment heather that i would make – or pam that i would make actually is on those border stores is even though those are some of our large volume stores or have been certainly in the past again its only  out of over  stores so i wouldnt make more out of it than it is but its certainly from a dollar standpoint or the strong dollar its certainly an issue to steves point about the energy thing weve been looking at this obviously a lot of people keep calling out the energy thing and how is it impacting us and i think it bears repeating that despite what some other retailers i know have said houston continues to be one of our strong markets so i dont know if its just our particular customer who isnt impacted by the energy in this particular market or what but it continues and granted we have a couple of our flagship stores here because its our home but its been very strong here in houston you certainly wouldnt know about the energy issue here pamela quintiliano  suntrust robinson humphrey okay well thats great to hear and then just one nudgy  followup on the energy question because i get it so often as well what are you keeping the tightest eye on or where do you think the correlation is it just – what do you think the strongest correlation i guess is when you look at the stores that are under performing in the energy states is it really that job data and related to losses with everything thats going on in that group or how do we think about that or is there a way to think about it steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer i think we tried to call it out by highlighting midland and odessa thats obviously one of the epicenters for drilling and fracking and as prices have come down in terms of price of barrel of oil weve seen some impact there so that seems to be the biggest correlation for us right now pamela quintiliano  suntrust robinson humphrey okay great thank you i know naïve question but i want to make sure there wasnt something else i was missing there and then just on home if we could delve into a little bit more and sorry if i missed this but specific anything more on classifications that youre very excited about with home obviously a big area of growth for you and anything exciting without revealing too much for competitive purposes that we should be thinking about for the back half of the year that youre doing differently steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer so we relaunched home in third quarter and we spoke a lot about that in third quarter and how proud we were of the results we stubbed our toe a little bit in the fourth quarter we probably didnt have enough giftable merchandise going forward and a lot of the assortment was focused on more dayin dayout purchases pleased to tell you as we already mentioned home was one of our strong businesses in the quarter so we see that drafting into second quarter what weve really been focusing on quite honestly for the back half of the year is really ratcheting up our gift offering within the home assortments that we can capitalize on holiday and so its a little premature at this point to kind of reveal what were doing there but we feel like weve got some really good solutions in terms of giftable merchandise for fourth quarter pamela quintiliano  suntrust robinson humphrey and theyre back to looking for the everyday products for q and you have the appropriate inventory for them steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer yeah absolutely and i think michael even called out were so happy with the home business that we have rolled out our expanded home concept or are rolling it out right now to an additional  doors so thatll get us into about  doors that have kind of the larger megasized footprint in home for us pamela quintiliano  suntrust robinson humphrey great thank you so much and best of luck michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director thanks steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer thanks operator your next question is from bob drbul with nomura securities your line is open bob s drbul  nomura securities international inc hi good morning i just had a couple of questions first can you give us the may comp and your monthtodate on may and on mothers day did you see a similar shift in terms of the performance of the comps that you were seeing in the border stores for the mothers day event or did it perform better steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer this is steve ill take a shot at answering that obviously this call is to talk about first quarter we did kind of take the unusual step of giving you some visibility through  weeks because quite honestly mothers day is a pretty key point in the calendar right i mean we look at kind of benchmarks throughout the year after easter after mothers day and unfortunately first quarter ends without the largest week of mothers day in it so we wanted to give you visibility into that were not going to share necessarily where we are monthtodate suffice it to say as michael said it was a record mothers day for us it moved us into the positive comp territory for the year which is exciting in terms of the border business it was good the first week it did lag the company much as it has done throughout the first part of the year bob s drbul  nomura securities international inc got it okay and then oded im not sure if you gave this but you talked about a marketing shift in terms of the dollars can you give us the dollar number in terms of how much you shifted out of q on the marketing side into q oded shein  cfo secretary treasurer  executive vp so you have to look at it in its entirety because there was a sales shift and a margin shift and expense shift altogether so when you look at the total picture the shift was not very significant bob s drbul  nomura securities international inc got it okay and then just on the ecommerce side how much of your offering is now online and can you just talk a little bit about sort of fulfillment and delivery in terms of what youre achieving and improvements that you expect from the new svp that you hired steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer sure so were at a point right now where virtually  of our store assortment is available online we have been ramping up obviously the exclusive piece of the assortment to offer an expanded assortment online with the idea being most of our stores are around  square feet on average what if we had a squarefoot store what would that look like and thats kind of the guiding principle the teams are using as theyre constructing assortments going forward from a fulfillment perspective we continue to invest in moving some goods to the distribution center to increase our fulfillment from the dc were north of  for first quarter so were climbing with our goal to get into that  to  range as we get closer to holiday were right on track to do that in terms of our new head of ecommerce really excited to have mike aboard he brings a lot of deep knowledge in this category and its premature to say exactly what all the changes hes going to bring about are hes only been on the job about two weeks but hes been here digging in really getting to know the team understand the strategy and probably in the next call well be able to give you a little more color in terms of some of the impacts hes had on the business but i could tell you hes come in and really hit the ground running and everybodys excited to have him here michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director hey bob its michael that was a good try trying to get us to talk about the second quarter bob s drbul  nomura securities international inc i have one more question michael i think one of the categories you caught out that was weaker was denim can you just talk a little bit about the trends going on there sort of are you heavy in denim in terms of is there inventory exposure there sort of how we should think about it going forward michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director im going to let steve talk about it but i tell you from my perspective it was weak certainly in the first quarter the crazy thing is as you probably know we keep hearing from all the manufacturers all the vendors that its really going to pick up in the second half of the year and ill let steve comment but you keep hearing that but frankly we havent seen it very much steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer so from an exposure perspective were not exposed on denim we obviously shifted a chunk of the buyin to the active athletic bottoms and that continues to do very well as michael alluded to hes also correct in telling you we havent really seen a pickup in first quarter in denim all the vendors are telling us that theyre seeing it out there amongst other accounts and for us long denim becomes a lot less important in the second quarter than maybe it does for other people but what we have done is in the denimcentric categories particularly the backtoschool categories taking a good stand in denim young mens juniors kids so were going to be in good shape in denim heading into backtoschool and well be positioned to take advantage of a resurgent denim business should it happen bob s drbul  nomura securities international inc great thank you very much operator your next question is from charles grom with sterne agee your line is open charles p grom  sterne agee crt hey good morning guys i know youre confirming the full year guidance but i know theres always a lot of moving parts interquarter and i just want to know if you guys want to use this opportunity to see if theres anything between quarters timing shifts that you wanted us to think about from a modeling cadence throughout the balance of the year oded shein  cfo secretary treasurer  executive vp so not really we dont like to talk about the quarters beyond the quarter that just happened we still think the same way about the year from all of its components no significant change no charles p grom  sterne agee crt okay great and then just on depreciation expense was up about  basis points yearoveryear and even though you guys had nice leverage in sga that was obviously a headwind i assume that some of the technology depreciating more quickly is that a good run rate for the balance of the year or was there some timing in the first quarter oded shein  cfo secretary treasurer  executive vp no i think thats a good run rate for the year charles p grom  sterne agee crt okay and then just on some of the sales drivers and i think the one thats got everybody excited is the  new stores that youre going to touch this year can you just delve into what that includes what you think the comp lift could be and again just remind us the timing of that when those will be completed steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer sure this is steve ill take a shot at answering that not to be evasive its hard to assign a comp number what weve done is we went out did a ton of research with customers and got their feedback in terms of what they wanted or were looking for from a friendlyshopping environment we came up with a list of  different factors as michael kind of listed off some of them it could be lighting it could be tiles it could be carpeting could be new fixtures could be mannequins could be fitting rooms and weve gone through and triaged our stores and said okay within some of these stores what needs to be done in some cases it maybe only one or two of those items so for example youve been in our meyerland store that store was pretty close to being where wed like it to be we needed to do a little work on lighting and fitting rooms in that case were probably not going to see a huge comp lift off of just changing the lighting a little bit or updating the fitting rooms although its something we needed to do so we can live up to our customers expectation other stores were doing more comprehensive remods and were touching maybe  or  of those factors were going to see a bigger lift off of and we feel like theyre going to give us a real tailwind so its hard to give you a total because there are so moving parts on a storetostore basis that its impossible to assign a comp to what the impact of that is going to be in terms of timing were getting a handful of those stores done right now as michael said well have even more stores done as we get into third quarter we should be done as we get out of third quarter heading into fourth quarter and thats where were going to see our biggest impact from new stores michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director clearly the lift chuck will come in the fourth quarter i mean were up against as you know a pretty difficult fourth quarter from a sales standpoint and i think thats where well see the results of the refixturing if you will charles p grom  sterne agee crt and when you take a step back the comps decline of down  and i know you dont give quarterly cadence but how much was that delta relative to your expectations how do you feel about the consumer when you take a big picture look at whats going on and all the puts and takes impacting your consumer michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director im not going to say the specific number to you other than to say that you know our expectations and were certainly focused on top line and there were just an awful lot of things that happened in the first quarter i mean the good news is it was first quarter and we got the rest of the year ahead of us and as we said for mothers day we feel it was just – i cant tell you how spectacular that week was i mean you obviously see how much it moved the needle for us and itd created some nice momentum and so well see how the rest of the year plays out but yes it was disappointing in the first quarter on the top line basis charles p grom  sterne agee crt okay all right guys good luck thanks michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director thanks operator your next question is from david mann with johnson rice your line is open david m mann  johnson rice  co llc yes thank you good morning can you talk a little bit about the trends youre seeing amongst the competitors how would you characterize the promotional environment steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer this is steve ill take a shot at answering that i mean its a question i think that comes up each quarter and i think our answer is always the same its competitive out there right i dont think that that lets up i mean we do see competitive intensity increase when you get around the natural selling peaks but certainly for mothers day it was a competitive mothers day we feel like we were obviously appropriately competitively priced i will say that a lot of people have revealed what their first quarter comps are and you know it was not an easy quarter for a lot of people out there you did see as we got to the tail end of the quarter people being a little more aggressive extending events or adding events in to try to move their comp as we got closer to the end of the quarter but i would say for the most part around the peaks it has been competitive and will always be competitive david m mann  johnson rice  co llc one of your competitors is for sale right now im just curious do you have any interest – have you looked at their store base any interest in any of their stores that might fit well into your network michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director david im certainly not going to comment on any matype activity but were all as opportunistic weve talked about in the past the fact that we have competitors in some of our markets and if they were ever made available we certainly would have potentially some interest its always nice to have less competition david m mann  johnson rice  co llc and then in terms of ecommerce i think the growth rate that you called out for the first quarter was somewhat similar to the rate that you generated last year how do you think about how ecommerce will perform over the rest of the year and when might we see some acceleration in that growth rate given the initiatives you have in place steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer so what i would tell you is one of our stated goals was to get to north of  penetration this year on an annualized basis were on track to deliver that right now we are excited to have mike aboard and not to put any pressure on him but im counting on him to accelerate it once he gets his feet under him he can really tear apart the strategy and put his own spin on it so were going to put a lot of pressure on him to accelerate it david m mann  johnson rice  co llc would that suggest probably more in the second half than in the second quarter steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer considering that he just started two weeks ago his impact is probably not going to be felt till the earliest third if not fourth quarter david m mann  johnson rice  co llc okay and then one last sort of quick question you talked about a reissue of the credit card can you just elaborate what might that entail and i think in the past when youve reissued you had a nice lift should we expect similar results with this reissue michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director you usually get a nice lift when you reissued the credit cards the last time weve done that was in  and its time to refresh the file and issue a new card so yes we expect to see a lift david m mann  johnson rice  co llc okay great thank you operator your next question is from jeff van sinderen with b riley  co your line is open jeff van sinderen  b riley  co llc good morning maybe you could just follow up a little bit on gross margin im just wondering if there is anything we should think about relevant to gross margin in q is there anything in terms of a port hangover do you feel like were through that issue at this point and then any timing shifts we should know about just related to q oded shein  cfo secretary treasurer  executive vp the first quarter merchandise margin improved by  basis points as we said and our guidance for the year hasnt changed youre still going to see a little bit of merchandise margin increase mostly stemming from q so for the rest of the year you can assume that merchandise margin is going to be pretty flat so no hangovers no issues just the cadence of the business jeff van sinderen  b riley  co llc okay thats helpful and then in terms of the – i know you spoke to some of the various markets with comps in the border stores and houston and so forth but im just wondering if you looked at the smaller versus larger markets and then maybe even how the jcpenneyonly markets were in terms of competition anything to call out there michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director actually jeff again weve been saying this actually for a couple quarters now its pretty consistent theres no specific – if you look around the country as you know were in  different states and its remarkable how consistent it is again within texas there were certain issues as we talked about the odessamidland or the border but then houston offset it but literally in terms of the rest of the country the small stores versus large stores the jcpenneys markets whatever other markets our performance is pretty consistent and youre talking about just a couple basis points one way or another nothing significant jeff van sinderen  b riley  co llc okay and then can you also just touch on your comps in cosmetics and then is that something that you see continuing to be a driver as you continue to roll out counters the rest of the year and then maybe also if you can just touch on the spring marketing some of the changes you made this year in terms of personalization any metrics you can share there to gauge success so far thanks michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director yes ill let steve handle some of the personalization and some of those items in terms of the cosmetics listen you know weve had a terrific track record these last few years these last few quarters with cosmetics as we continue to roll out the estée lauder and clinique counters i see no reason for that to change as we said earlier were going to do about  more counters or  more stores actually with estée lauder and clinique going to do an additional  stores with smashbox and origins i mean that tends to be a real winner for us and theres certainly no sign of that changing so i feel really good about that were testing in some of our smaller stores i know the question often comes up how many stores can you continue to roll estée lauder and clinique out to and every time we give you a number we seem to be able to exceed it the next couple the next year or whatever right now were testing some smaller counters frankly that work well hopefully in some of our smaller stores which enable us to continue on that path but well see but so far so good and feel great about where we are with cosmetics steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer in terms of personalization obviously a hot topic out there in retail right now we definitely are looking at ways to continue to reach out to our customer speak to them on a more oneonone basis some examples of that for mothers day we actually did a couple different versions one version went out to only our plussize customers versus another version went out to more traditional missy  customers we try to personalize emails and texts based off shopping patterns that are out there were doing some personalization in terms of direct mail where were changing it up based off of whether youre a mencentric customer a home customer kids customer et cetera so definitely something were focused on and working on were in the early innings on that its not like weve got a huge run rate on this so far but so far really pleased with the results and something were going to continue to do more and more of jeff van sinderen  b riley  co llc okay good to hear thanks very much and good luck michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director thanks jeff operator your next question is from david glick with buckingham research your line is open david j glick  the buckingham research group inc thank you just a couple quick questions your new svp of ecommerce you listed a number of companies with relevant experience just curious where he came from most recently and then secondly it sounds like mens and accessories a little tougher those are typically – have been strong businesses for you if im not mistaken curious what the strategies are to turn that around and then third just some commentary on footwear which weve been hearing from other companies has been improving and the potential for a strong footwear and resurgent denim business what that might mean for backtoschool thanks michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director hi david michael first of all let me just start with mike smith for a second most recently he was at signet which is i know youre familiar with the beauty of him coming from signet frankly is that hes used to dealing with multiple nameplates so as you know signet i guess has jared and kay and zales and various nameplates so hes dealt with that issue that obviously we have at times struggled with and so thats just one positive why were happy to have him with us and we think hell make a big impact here oded shein  cfo secretary treasurer  executive vp in terms of the businesses you asked about specifically the mens business probably our biggest drag there quite honestly has just been our inability at least in the first quarter to sell seasonal products with some of the weather we experienced seasonals really were late in opening up the good news is once we did get into that mothers day shift we did see not only within the womens business the seasonals across all the categories open up and speaking a little bit to the marketing shift that we did for mothers day one of the things that we have noticed is that the timing on these events at least from a brickandmortar perspective seems to be compressing we used to look at mothers day fathers day easter as twoweek events it seems like more and more at least from a brickandmortar perspective theyre compressing down into a day to day event which is one of the reasons why we purposely made the shift we did for mothers day to move marketing out from two weeks out into the week out and that paid off for us so we think that that obviously would work as well for fathers day in terms of accessories most of the categories within accessories have been pretty solid handbag business good costume jewelry business good we did have a little softness in fine jewelry we did see it come back a little bit for mothers day were very bullish about our handbag business going forward in the second quarter were also excited to see some of our seasonal categories there open up like sun so we think thats already on the road to recovery you mentioned shoes shoes has been one of our strongest businesses it was our strongest business last year in the total company and it was one of our weaker businesses in first quarter so when we talk about port issues ive characterized it as more of an annoyance than a hardcore problem a few of the shoe buyer the shoe dmm theyre going to tell you its more of a problem and that was the area that was probably most impacted by the port strike and slowdowns in deliveries because so much of that does come from china and it comes through the west coast were back in good inventory position in shoes shoes like a lot of the businesses had a really really good mothers day we saw the seasonal businesses open up there like sandals and we feel really good about our fathers day and really our backtoschool business in shoes so we feel like shoes is going to be a tailwind for us the rest of the year david j glick  the buckingham research group inc great thanks very much good luck oded shein  cfo secretary treasurer  executive vp thanks dave operator your next question is from jeff stein with northcoast research your line is open jeff s stein  northcoast research partners llc a couple questions first for oded oded it seems to me that with your guidance and based on what you did in the first quarter youre essentially telling us that youre going to be flat at the highend and down at the lowend of the range over the balance of the year and i just got to make sure i understand if that in fact is kind of what youre expecting oded shein  cfo secretary treasurer  executive vp so jeff as we said throughout the year we believe that this guidance is conservative we want to make sure that we can accomplish what we set out to do and what we have guided the street right so i would mention that again we are pleased with the first quarter results we didnt see any significant material reason to change our guidance at this point jeff s stein  northcoast research partners llc okay you mentioned credit penetration improved  basis points exactly where were you at the end of the quarter compared to prior year and how much increase did you see in your credit income in the first quarter oded shein  cfo secretary treasurer  executive vp so we were north of  in penetration were consistently seeing quarters over  again very excited about that because its so important with our communication with the customer increasing loyalty of course helping sales and the bottom line i dont want to get into too much of the income but certainly the income or the benefits from the credit card program increased nicely in the first quarter jeff s stein  northcoast research partners llc okay and when you relaunched your credit card in the fourth quarter are there going to be any enhancements to the loyalty program or special incentives to come out and use the new card immediately i think you did that in  michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director jeff for sure i mean thats something were going to take advantage of the opportunity of the reissue obviously to more than just send out a card but obviously do some things from a value proposition standpoint that we think will be meaningful and significant and hopefully certainly not only drive the use of the card but hopefully help our top line as well oded shein  cfo secretary treasurer  executive vp and jeff as you know we are constantly thinking and improving our loyalty programs and over the course of the year we plan to test a number of different loyalty permutations and see what works best for our customers so youve got to think about relaunching the card and also expanding the loyalty program jeff s stein  northcoast research partners llc how many cards do you plan on sending out and how would that compare to  oded shein  cfo secretary treasurer  executive vp its over  million cards our program is constantly growing i dont know the exact growth rate we can get back to you with that jeff s stein  northcoast research partners llc okay and just trying to isolate the weather impact can you parse out how your comps trended in february compared to march april on a combined basis steven paul lawrence  chief merchandising officer so this is steve ill take a shot at that we had a lot of momentum coming out of fourth quarter and we saw that continue into the first part of february i will tell you that in the back half of february in our geography a lot of ice storms closures of stores and its like hit the brakes and gave back a lot of what we gained obviously in the first half of the month once we got past february i would say it was less about ice and snow it was more about not warm temperatures but really rain in our geography i joke with michael every day its raining down here i think im building an ark in my backyard so thats impacted our ability to sell seasonals primarily but certainly the biggest impact from a store closure and from a ice and temperature was felt in february jeff s stein  northcoast research partners llc so steve would it be fair i mean was february down midsingle digit or not that much michael l glazer  president chief executive officer  director jeff were not going to give specific months other than to say the month of february was down for us and obviously impacted by the weather as steve pointed out the other thing to say on the weather thing is even where we didnt have the stores shut down and all the issues with the roads and so forth when you get into easter there as you know it really comes down to not – people always keep talking about the timing of easter and is it too early or is it too late but it really comes down to what those weather conditions are and whether youre going to start selling some of the seasonal springtype goods and obviously this year that was also kind of difficult jeff s stein  northcoast research partners llc okay and just final question with respect to store closings is the number still  to  for the year oded shein  cfo secretary treasurer  executive vp that is correct jeff s stein  northcoast research partners llc okay great okay guys thanks a lot michael l
