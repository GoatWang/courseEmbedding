untapped investment opportunity we seek office space in urban environments that have high employment growth and that attract todays top talent the us is experiencing a shift in office trends  there is a greater demand for todays top talent and companies are changing in order to attract and retain them these individuals prioritize lifestyle when they decide where to work and live and this includes seeking more open collaborative work spaces in urban or urbanlike areas characteristics of open office typically include creative floor plans multipurpose areas flexible work spaces natural light indoor and outdoor space executive spotlight martin caverly resource real estate executive spotlight martin caverly resource real estate resource innovation office reit is betting that future office space will be more creative and less structured than the offices of today by leah etling  aug   aug comma  national office people more executive profilesqa facebook twitter google linkedin email subscribe to cpe martin caverly what does the future of office space look like resource real estate inc a global real estate firm sponsoring alternative investments through a series of reits is betting it is more creative and less structured than the offices of today it encourages spontaneous coworker engagement is located in an urban environment with proximity to public transportation and can easily be turned over from tenant to tenant martin caverly is leading this effort as chief investment officer of resource innovation office reit we talked to caverly who oversaw the restructuring of evoq properties out of the meruelo maddux properties bankruptcy in  about his views on creative office cpe where did this revisioning of office space come from caverly one of the things we did at evoq that turned out to be valuable was converting some of our old warehouse buildings our biggest trophy asset was alameda square which is arts district adjacent in downtown la we took one of these big old buildings—a former storageandmanufacturing space with high floortoceilings really cool window lines and mushroom columns—and turned that into an squarefoot office it quickly leased to a major fashionapparel company we had stumbled upon this idea of creative office cpe what does the phrase “creative office” really mean caverly it is about authenticity of place location working collaboratively and using space efficiently these are openplan spaces without many individual offices or assigned seating they allow businesses to function more efficiently compete for top talent and have flexibility within their workspace cpe why office space and why now caverly the macro view has been that office has been the laggard in this economic recovery period there has not been as much new development because banks are still tight when it comes to office unlike some other types of product but the nature of how we use offices is changing and even major companies are moving out of the suburbs and back toward the urban core millennials do not want to commute to the suburbs companies are realizing that you have to change how you use office space to get your people to come in you want them to be in the office happily and voluntarily it requires a new way of thinking about how you use your space cpe how will the resource innovation office reit manage these assets caverly we want to hold assets for  years at a time—we are not looking for a threeyear holdandsell cycle once someone else has taken the risk of converting and repositioning the building we will buy it and hold it and aggressively asset manage it cpe who is the target tenant caverly tech and media are the obvious sectors but others would be law financial services energy manufacturing and everything in between just about every industry is looking for smarter ways to utilize office space cpe where will you look for properties to purchase caverly we have  target markets where we have observed companies relocating to a downtownproximate location from the suburbs as well as a large millennial workforce asset identifiers include redeveloped warehouses traditional older buildings with good bones that have been reskinned and amenitized those markets include san diego portland denver minneapolis chicago and nashville cpe any concerns about purchasing in a strong market caverly we feel we will be buying at  to  percent below what i think the peak was which was october to december of  if you can buy lower that is always good but our advantage is we are going to buy buildings that we think have a competitive releasing advantage in the future so they’ll have higher rents higher occupancy and hopefully higher values we think the timing is great related posts on the market  interesting listings for july
