studies evaluating pulmaquin for the chronic treatment of noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients with lung infections with pseudomonas aeruginosa company to host conference call at  pm et today hayward califbusiness wire aradigm corporation nasdaqardm the company today announced topline results from its two phase  clinical trials orbit and orbit evaluating the safety and efficacy of pulmaquin® the companys investigational proprietary formulation of once daily ciprofloxacin for inhalation in patients with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis noncf be with chronic lung infections with pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa the orbit and orbit pivotal trials were identical in design except for a pharmacokinetics substudy that was conducted in one of the trials the primary endpoint in both orbit and orbit was an increase in the median time to first mild moderate or severe pulmonary exacerbation pe the key secondary efficacy endpoint in both trials was the frequency of pes over the week doubleblind treatment period in orbit the median time to first mild moderate or severe pe was  days in the pulmaquin treatment group as compared to  days in the placebo group this increase in the median time to first pe was statistically significant p using nonstratified logrank analysis in the key secondary efficacy endpoint there was a  reduction in the frequency of pes over the week treatment period in the pulmaquin treatment group as compared to the placebo group this result was statistically significant p with a hazard ratio of pulmaquinplacebo of  using nonstratified binomial regression in orbit the median time to first mild moderate or severe pe was  days in the pulmaquin treatment group as compared to  days in the placebo group this increase in the median time to first pe was similar to orbit but was not statistically significant p using nonstratified logrank analysis in the key secondary efficacy endpoint there was a  reduction in the frequency of pes over the week treatment period in the pulmaquin treatment group as compared to the placebo group this result was not statistically significant p with a hazard ratio of pulmaquinplacebo of  using nonstratified binomial regression the analyses of combined data from both studies resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the number of pes over the week doubleblind period hazard ratio pulmaquinplacebo  p representing a  reduction in pes over the period when the additional analyses of combined data from both studies were conducted taking into account only pes that were moderate or severe ie those that required interventions with antibiotics or hospitalization the median time to first pe in the pulmaquin group was  days vs placebo  days p there was also a statistically significant reduction in the number of moderate and severe pes over the week doubleblind period hazard ratio pulmaquinplacebo  p using nonstratified analysis representing a  reduction in pes over the period in each study the treatment groups were stratified for gender pretrial frequency of exacerbations and smoking status the statistical analysis plan for the studies called for stratified analyses however since some strata were found to have no or very few subjects both nonstratified and stratified analyses were conducted the company believes that due to the limited number of subjects in some strata the nonstratified analyses are more appropriate as strata that are too small can produce highly unstable estimated treatment effects with potential outliers using the stratified analyses the median time to first pe in orbit was pulmaquin  days placebo  days p and for orbit was pulmaquin  days placebo  days p both studies demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in p aeruginosa density at day  the end of the first ontreatment period orbit p   orbit p   for each study the magnitude of this antibiotic effect remained persistent throughout all ontreatment periods pulmaquin was safe and well tolerated in both studies there were no differences in the changes of lung function fev  predicted and fvc  predicted or symptoms of airway irritation between the pulmaquin and placebo groups in the two studies overall the incidence of all treatment emergent adverse events teae was similar between the pulmaquin and placebo groups in both orbit pulmaquin  placebo  and orbit pulmaquin  placebo  in orbit the rates of serious teaes were  with pulmaquin and  with placebo while in orbit the rates were  versus  for each study the randomization rate of pulmaquin treated subjects to placebo was  to  there were  deaths in orbit pulmaquin   placebo   and  deaths in orbit pulmaquin   placebo   none of the deaths was related to pulmaquin or placebo the most frequently observed treatment related teaes were of respiratorythoracicmediastinal nature and were reported in orbit by  of subjects with pulmaquin and in  of subjects with placebo while the rates in orbit were  with pulmaquin versus  with placebo after the completion of the week doubleblind period both pulmaquin and placebo treated patients were given the opportunity to receive pulmaquin in a day open label extension period eightynine percent of the patients who completed orbit and  percent of the patients who completed orbit enrolled in the extension period patients with noncystic fibrosis be chronically infected with p aeruginosa have a particularly severe form of this disease it is exciting to see that after many setbacks in the development of inhaled antibiotics to treat these patients we are finally seeing results with good safety and efficacy said dr anne odonnell md professor of medicine and chief division of pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine georgetown university medical center washington dc who was the principal investigator for the north american segment of the orbit and orbit trials chronic lung infections with p aeruginosa are a growing global health care problem for patients with lung diseases like noncystic fibrosis be and copd in cystic fibrosis patients we have had success in treating chronic lung infections with inhaled antibiotics and i am very pleased that pulmaquin is demonstrating a reduction of pulmonary exacerbations in noncystic fibrosis be said dr charles haworth md frcp director cambridge centre for lung infection papworth hospital cambridge uk who was the principal investigator for the phase  studies for exnorth american regions the company also announced that it has received the final statistical analysis report from the two year inhalation carcinogenicity study in rats with pulmaquin there were no differences in the rate of observed tumors between the pulmaquin and control groups we sincerely thank all of the patients and investigators who participated in these studies for their commitment we are delighted that once daily inhaled pulmaquin is demonstrating a compelling reduction of pulmonary exacerbations and persistent antibiotic activity against p aeruginosa infections together with a good tolerability and safety profile in our phase  clinical trials as well as no carcinogenicity in animal studies we will review the next steps towards an application for approval of pulmaquin in the us at an upcoming meeting scheduled with fda and are planning to engage soon in discussions of these results with the ema as well said dr juergen froehlich md aradigms chief medical officer aradigm has been granted orphan drug designation for pulmaquin for noncf be in the us in addition fda has designated pulmaquin

intravenous formulations is a widely prescribed antibiotic it is used to treat acute lung infections and is often preferred because of its broadspectrum antibacterial activity against various bacteria such as p aeruginosa pulmaquin was evaluated in two phase  studies to determine its safety and effectiveness as a onceaday inhaled formulation for the chronic treatment of patients with noncf be who have chronic lung infections with p aeruginosa following phase a development of the liposomal portion of pulmaquin lipoquin® and phase  development of pulmaquin the phase b study orbit with pulmaquin was a week multicenter randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled trial in  adult noncf be subjects this study demonstrated a significant reduction in p aeruginosa sputum density p and an increase in time to first exacerbation in the per protocol population p and the mitt p populations in the pulmaquin treated subjects compared to placebo overall the incidence of all treatment emergent adverse events was similar between groups the most frequently reported treatment related adverse events reported by ≥  patients in either treatment group included product taste abnormal and nausea in the pulmaquin group and wheezing in the placebo group no serious adverse events were considered treatment related there were no deaths reported during orbit the phase  clinical program for pulmaquin in noncf be consisted of two worldwide doubleblind placebocontrolled pivotal trials orbit and orbit that are identical in design except for a pharmacokinetics substudy that was conducted in one of the trials each trial enrolled patients  in orbit and  in orbit into a week doubleblind period consisting of  cycles of  days on treatment with pulmaquin or placebo plus  days off treatment followed by a  day open label extension in which all participants received pulmaquin total treatment duration including the doubleblind period of approximately one year the superiority of pulmaquin vs placebo during the doubleblind period was evaluated in terms of the time to first pe primary endpoint while key secondary endpoints included the reduction in the number of pes and improvements in quality of life measures lung function was monitored as a safety indicator aradigm has been granted orphan drug designations for liposomal ciprofloxacin as well as for ciprofloxacin for inhalation for noncf be in the
