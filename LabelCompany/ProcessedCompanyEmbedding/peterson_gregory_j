patent document maintained in secrecy including without limitation its rights pursuant to  cfr § background of the invention field of the inventionthe present invention pertains generally to a fuel manufacturing apparatus and more particularly to an apparatus and method for converting flammable material such as waxed corrugated cardboard into compact artificial firelogs or firestarter chips description of the background artthe popularity of log burning fireplaces as an amenity and as a supplemental source of heat continues to grow with cutting restrictions on government land as well as the closing of many wood processing plants wood logs can be difficult and expensive to obtain as a result artificial firelogs which generally burn cleaner and light faster have been gaining in popularityon the other hand boxes and containers made from cardboard are widely used in an almost infinite variety of applications such as packaging produce shipping and storage of goods and the like as such there is an abundant supply of discarded cardboard boxes readily available for recycling it has been recognized that discarded cardboard boxes form a potential fuel material and the general concept of converting used or discarded cardboard boxes into burnable firelogs has been applied with some level of successmachines have been previously developed to convert such cardboard boxes into compact burnable firelogs such machines include a feed system such as a hammermill for receiving a sheet of cardboard a cutting mechanism for slicing the cardboard sheet into strips and then cutting the strips into chips and a compactingcompressing punch press assembly for shaping the chips into compact firelog structures which can be burned in a fireplace binders such as glue are used to hold the chips together after compression additionally the finished firelogs can be dipped into wax to create an outer wax coating to enhance their burn capabilitythese existing machines however are designed to cut and shape plain cardboard boxes that is cardboard without a wax or waxlike coating thereon existing machines are not made to cut and shape waxed corrugated cardboard furthermore the design of these machines does not take into account that by using glue as a binder to hold regular unwaxed cardboard together into a compressed log the corrugations are destroyed when the strips or chips are smashed and glued together quite significantly we have found that regular and waxed corrugated cardboard has a memory and while the corrugated segments stick together they are flattened and compressed if glue is not used as a binder upon heating the corrugated segments expand back into an open structure through which airflow is increased which leads to more efficient burning current fire log production machines are not able to make use of this memory property of corrugated cardboardit will be appreciated that resource conservation continues to be important as our population increases and our level of resources diminish therefore corrugated cardboard boxes as is the case with many other materials are generally recycled to reduce waste waxcoated corrugated cardboard boxes however are generally nonrecyclable waxcoated corrugated cardboard boxes are commonly coated with a paraffinbased wax which is very expensive to separate from the cardboard within a normal repulping systems consequently used waxcoated corrugated cardboard boxes wocc are generally discarded in landfills in view of present interests regarding conservation of resources and environmental consciousness the ability to reuse such discarded material in a form of fuel would serve to reduce the demand for other types of fuels such as oil gas or coal thus further conserving natural resources and preserving the environmentadditionally current log manufacturing machines destroy the corrugation within the corrugated cardboard which reduces the flow and permeation of wax and oxygen throughout the firelog which results in an incomplete and inefficient burning of the firelogmoreover current log manufacturing machines produce firelogs with “cold joints” at the intervals between punches or presses these cold joints are also formed when the chips are compressed vertically within the structure of the log rather than disposed horizontally around the log in a circular fashion cold joints are weak links within the firelog that easily break up into multiple sections when any shear or tensile force is exerted upon them the punch or press machine creates vertical arrangements of the chips within the firelog when burned the vertical chip arrangement causes chips to burn from the edge rather than from the side therefore chips of corrugated cardboard so pressed into a log are not allowed to open and expand with heat because of the vertical arrangement and the glued corrugationsaccordingly there exists a need for an artificial firelog manufacturing apparatus that provides the capability to recycle prewaxed corrugated cardboard boxes into firelogs that are more structurally rigid and that burn more efficiently using horizontally disposed segments over that which is presently known in the art the present invention satisfies those needs as well as others and overcomes the deficiencies found in currently known artificial firelog producing machinesbrief summary of the inventionthe present invention is an apparatus which converts standard wax coated corrugated cardboard sheets into artificial firelogs or firestarter chips the apparatus can therefore create firelogs from the waxcoated corrugated material that would otherwise be disposed of within landfills recycling this waxcoated material by means of this apparatus can create the equivalent of  million pound firelogs annuallythe invention produces artificial firelogs or firestarter chips by first slicing waxed corrugated cardboard sheets into strips and then cutting the strips into segments each cut segment retains its original corrugated structure and wax content the waxcoated corrugated cardboard segments are then compressed and shaped longitudinally into firelogs which are generally cylindrical the longitudinal orientation of the segments whose corrugated structure has been retained coupled with the memory effect exhibited by the compressed corrugated cardboard results in a more efficient burn as the segments open up to increase airflow furthermore by adding wax or waxlike materials any form of new remnant or recycled unwaxed corrugated cardboard can be processed into artificial firelogs and firestartersby way of example and not of limitation the artificial firelog producing apparatus of the present invention generally comprises a cardboard strip cutting mechanism a segment cutting mechanism and a conveyor compression mechanism the strip cutting mechanism employs a plurality of upper circular blades with teeth juxtaposed axially and a plurality of lower circular blades with teeth juxtaposed axially such that the cutting edge of the upper circular blades overlap the cutting edge of the lower circular blades whose interaction cuts the waxed corrugated cardboard sheets into waxed corrugated cardboard strips a segment cutting mechanism in the form of a cutting reel is disposed adjacent to the lower circular blade which then cuts the strips of waxed corrugated cardboard into segments a conveyor compression mechanism in the form of an auger is positioned beneath the cutting reel and terminates in a log forming die for conveying and compressing the corrugated segments into a log shaped extrusionthe upper and lower circular blades in the strip cutting mechanism effectively meter and slice multiple waxed corrugated cardboard sheets fed therein into waxed corrugated cardboard strips the waxed corrugated cardboard strips are then fed through the cutting reel which cuts the waxed corrugated cardboard strips into waxed corrugated cardboard segments the waxed corrugated cardboard segments are then fed into the conveyor compression auger for transport and compression into a log die as the conveyor compression auger transports the waxed corrugated cardboard segments the segments are horizontally disposed around the housing between rifling in a circular interlocking manner and are gradually compressed and forced into the log die the log die compresses and shapes the waxed corrugated cardboard segments into artificial firelogs alternately the exit portion of the housing may be configured to perform the functions of the log die however this precludes changing log forms without major changes to the apparatus firestarter chips are produced by bypassing the auger and log dieuse of a conveyor compression auger results is a significant improvement over punch presstype machines because the conveyor compression auger horizontally based on the longitudinal axis of the firelog flattens the waxed corrugated cardboard segments as opposed to vertically flattening or crushing the cardboard segments which as a result form cold joints in logs produced from these piston style systems the conveyor compression auger with its internal rifling also eliminates cold joints in the firelog by spinning the flattened chips horizontally and interlocking them throughout the log thus eliminating the likelihood of the firelog breaking into segments on the fireplace grate the horizontal longitudinal orientation also allows the segments to expand and burn off the exterior of the log layer after flattened layer as each flattened corrugated segment is being consumed by the flames it expands from the memory effect in the corrugations which thereby allows the air to flow through the segment for a more efficient burn once a segment has been consumed it falls away as the next layered segment starts burning this burning sequence continues until the entire log has been consumed therefore the inventive apparatus retains the corrugation structure and creates a longitudinal segment orientation to provide for the manufacture of firelogs which do not easily break and which burn in a similar manner to genuine wood barkan object of the invention is to

of a square bolt flange  preferably of a ½″×″×″ configuration to the auger housing  rifling  is shown within the interior of the conical section  of the auger housing fig  and fig  show a side and an end view of the log die  as shown in fig  the log die  comprises a housing  approximately  inches in length containing both an inlet side  and a material outlet side  the log die is attached to the conical auger housing via square bolt flange  wherein the inner opening  of the log die receives the waxed compressed cardboard material pushed by the conveyor compression screw not shown three sections or zones exist along the length of the log die a conical zone  wherein the shape and rifling  of the conical section  are continued a recompression zone  wherein the material after leaving the rifled sections is recompressed and a shaping zone  wherein the waxed corrugated cardboard segment material is finally shaped such that the material exiting the log die  is of the desired diameter and shape for the artificial firelog being producedas it has been found desirable to control the temperature of the log die  during the formation of artificial firelogs  the log die  is configured with a cooling jacket  surrounding the inner walls of the log die the cooling jacket  allows the temperature of the log die to be controlled by varying the amount and temperature of incoming coolant which is routed into input  through the cooling jacket  the coolant exits the cooling jacket  by way of the outlet  alternately the log die could be cooled with conventional means such as fans cooling fins or similar heat dissipation structures in addition it may be desirable to cool the conveyor housing  the conveyor housing may be cooled with conventionally known methods such as a combination of cooling fins and fans a cooling jacket not shown may also be added to the conical auger housing section  in similar manner to the cooling jacket  of the log die fig  is a schematic of the alignment of waxed corrugated cardboard segments  around the periphery of the conveyor compression screw upon shaft  a clearance of approximately ¼″ exists between the outer circumferential edges of the helical blade and the circular passageway  as seen in fig  the clearance allows interlocking of the compressed circumferentiallydisposed waxed corrugated cardboard segments a near the inner surfaces of conical section  and log die  because waxed corrugated cardboard segments  are compressed circumferentially around firelog  they open or expand because of memory with heat when burned and the corrugations channel oxygen throughout the segments within a firelog  waxed corrugated cardboard segments are more tightly twisted in the center of firelog  increasing their burn time these radially disposed segments within the firelog  provide for easy ignition and a high burn efficiency while the resulting flames appear similar to the burning of a genuine bark firelogfig  is a schematic of a firelog crosssection showing orientation of a few of the waxed corrugated cardboard segments b radially disposed within the firelogfig  through fig  depict two log dies alternately being connected

endview of the combined log die and auger housing  it can be noted in these figures that the two sections mate together with smooth transitions from within the conical section  of the auger housing  to the conical zone  of the log die  this transition includes proper alignment of the rifling  although logs can be produced without the alignment and smooth transitions they allow the extrusion of logs under reduced pressuresfig  and fig  are a side and end view of an alternate log die design  this log die schematic is shown with two separating halves   which are bolted together and attached to the conical auger housing not shown additionally diespacers   are shown by varying the width of the diespacers   firelogs may be extruded with variously sized longitudinal rails the diespacers can alternately be made to extend into the log extrusion area such that logs are produced with longitudinal groovesfig  is a side view of the cutting assembly for the waxed corrugated cardboard a plurality of lower circular blades  with teeth  and a plurality of upper circular blades  with teeth perform slicing of the waxed corrugated cardboard into strips and a cutting reel  in conjunction with a bed bar knife  then cuts the strips into waxed corrugated cardboard segments lower circular blades  are juxtaposed along a lower axis  and are separated by spacers  which maintain a constant distance between each lower circular blade  the spacers  are made with a recessed center to minimize the contact with the irregular surface of the inner portion of the cutting blades upper circular blades  are juxtaposed along an upper axis  and are separated by spacers  waxed corrugated cardboard sheets are fed along channel  between a lower guide plate  and an upper guide plate  the cardboard material is cut into strips by the cutting edges   a vertical guide plate  prevents material strips that exit the cutting blades from becoming reengaged with the cutting bladeswaxed corrugated cardboard strips then arrive at shearing contact between cutting reel  that contains cutting blades  which shear the cardboard against a cutting surface  of a bed bar knife retained on a bed plate fig  shows one of the cutting blades  of the cutting reel  as depicted in fig  the cutting blade is a generally rectangular member containing a steeledged longitudinal cutting surface which is used in combination with the bed bar knife not shown to shear the waxed corrugated cardboard strips into cardboard segmentsfig  is the cutting reel  nonmower type as shown in fig  the cutting reel retains a plurality of cutting blades  about a central axis  the cutting blades  are shown helically attached to the cutting reel  annularly disposed about the axis  in connection with a first and a second end panel   three inner support panels not shown are spaced evenly between first and second end panels   to retain the blades at a fixed radial distance from the central axis  cutting blades  are positioned circumferentially between first and second end panels   starting and ending with an angle of generally less than or equal to angle θ shown cutting blades  are generally retained parallel to the axial shaft  whereby rotation of axial shaft  thereby causes rotation of attached cutting blades  typically the cutting reel  should have a diameter of at least approximately inches and the axial shaft  typically should have a diameter of at least approximately ½ inches axial shaft  is typically inches in length with inch threads a inch standard key the cutting reel may be fabricated from mild steel case hardened steel or like material cutting reel  herein uses cutting blades  wherein  such blades are preferred the cutting blades  are equally spaced apart each having a length of approximately inches first and second end panels   and the three inner support panels have slots not shown to provide access for cutting blades  to be longitudinally inserted therethrough at their proper angles the angle θ of the helical mounting of the blades is important as too great an angle causes the chips to jam to one side of the machine the angle θ used within this embodiment is  degrees as larger angles began causing waxed corrugated strips to be pushed to one side making a wad that the cutting reel jams on to facilitate cutting and aid in the migration of waxed corrugated cardboard segments the cutting blades  are helically configured within the cutting reel  in this preferred configuration the cutting blades  have a left hand helix while cutting reel  rotates counterclockwisereferring to fig  the mechanism which cuts the waxed corrugated cardboard into strips is shown with a series of upper circular blades  juxtaposed along an upper axis  comprising a shaft  wherein each of the upper circular blades are separated by spacers  lower axis  comprises a lower shaft  upon which a series of lower circular blades  separated by spacers  are juxtaposed along a lower axis  both lower shaft  and upper shaft  are parallel and spaced apart such that the cutting edges  of lower circular blades  partially overlap the cutting edges  of upper circular blades  lower and upper shafts   are of a diameter to fit into a correspondingly sized bore within lower and upper circular blades   a range of  to  blades are typically used per axis upper shaft  used herein is approximately ⅛ inches in length and contains a full length standard keyway not shown with a inch threads portion starting from its left end a collar not shown welded thereon allows for axially adjusting upper shaft  to allow for some compression between lower and upper circular blades   lower shaft  used within this embodiment is approximately  inches long and includes a full length standard keyway not shown and inches of threads at each end lower and upper shafts   are fabricated from mild steel case hardened steel or like material lower and upper circular blades   within this embodiment can range between approximately ¼ inches to inches in diameter but preferably inch nonfluted hollow ground blades are should be used because their cutting edges   have nonfluted straight teeth  which are necessary for grabbing and metered pulling of the material into the machine evenly for slicing and then pushing the waxed corrugated cardboard strips to the cutting reel without slipping the large number of cutting teeth although nonfluted create uneven cutting tracks to provide a fuzzy edge on the waxed corrugated cardboard being cut slices of waxed corrugated cardboard sheets  or waxed corrugated cardboard boxes are imparted with a fuzzy edge which operates to decrease the time required to ignite a segment fig  and fig  are side and facing views of the spacer  used between the lower cutting blades the spacers  used between the upper blades within this embodiment are interchangeable with the spacers  for the lower cutting blades the annular face  of the spacer  is the only portion of the spacer visible exterior of the assembled apparatus spacers are mounted to a shaft via mounting hole  and retained by a shaft key engagement of the keyway fig  depicts the interaction of the upper and lower circular blades within the embodiment using an inch circular blade the depth of the overlap  between the cutting edges   should be at least ¼inch teeth  are angled in such a manner to draw or pull one or more waxed corrugated cardboard sheets into the cutting edges   while not allowing the sheets to slip during cutting the teeth of the cutting blades impart a fuzzy edge to the waxed corrugated cardboard being cut circular blades   within the embodiment are case hardened to a rockwell hardness of  or greater and are thick enough approximately  inches so as not to flex apart lower and upper spacers   have a diameter of approximately ½ inches to inches when used with an inch cutting blade since a minimum separation of ½ inches must be maintained between cutting edges  of lower circular blade  and lower spacers  and also between cutting edges  of upper circular blades  and upper spacers  the included angle α is measured between the tips of the fully overlapping blades   at tips   through the point  wherein the blade tips coincide the embodiment of the apparatus is configured with angle α set to  degrees to ensure proper and reliable feeding of waxed corrugated cardboard sheets or boxes  into cutting assemblyfig  is a plan view of the lower guide plate  with a plurality of slots  the upper guide plate  not shown is similarly slotted the slots within the lower and upper guides plates   allow the cutting edges  of lower circular blades  and cutting edges  of upper circular blades  to extend therethrough for engagement and cutting of the waxed corrugated cardboard material slots  are typically no greater than ¼ inches wide to help prevent lower and upper circular blades   from clogging lower and upper circular blades are selfclearing due to their minimal clearances within slots  in upper and lower guides plates   as the slots  extend only approximately  inches beyond the interposing circular bladesfig  is a side view of the waxed corrugated cardboard cutting assembly  showing waxed corrugated cardboard sheets  being fed into the input side wherein the material is sliced into waxed corrugated cardboard strips  and then segmented into waxed corrugated cardboard segments  lower and upper guide plates   reside as generally planar sections between the lower and upper circular blades   and are typically parallel to each other near the junction of the upper and lower cutting surfaces these two guide plates form a defined path or channel  through which waxed corrugated cardboard sheets  can enter cutting assembly  and through which sliced waxed corrugated cardboard strips  pass on their way to being segmented the distance between the upper and lower guide plates   respectively provide a channel  that helps direct the waxed corrugated cardboard sheets  into the cutting bladesa vertical guide plate  extends upwardly from upper guide plate  proximate to cutting reel  for separating waxed corrugated cardboard strips  just prior to contact with cutting reel  which prevent reverse flow of material lower guide plate  terminates at the inner edge directly above the cutting surface  of a bed bar knife  a bed plate  disposed below bed bar knife  directs waxed corrugated cardboard segments a towards as shown in fig  through fig  an opening  which is in material communication with conveyor compression auger assembly  attachment means  such as a nut and bolt are used to attach bed bar knife  onto bed plate  the bed plate attaches by two outer studs which are threaded into each end of the bed plate and are fitted through the outer wall of the cutting assembly the bed plates are not fixed but swivel freely to allow adjustment however they remain ridged in their horizontal angle relationship to the reel the pitch angle of bed plate  can be configured to provide for adjustment of the angle and to partially compensate for wear of the bed bar knife as cutting blades  revolve each blade passes in close proximity to cutting surface  of bed bar knife  which results in shearing of the waxed corrugated cardboard strips  passing therethrough into waxed corrugated cardboard segments  paper sheet layers may be added to the waxed corrugated cardboard sheets  so that a paper mix  is created with the waxed corrugated cardboard segments a this paper mix is typically used for firestarter materialfig  is a schematic of the cutting reel  position in relation to the cutting edge  of the bed bard knife  the axis of rotation of the cutting reel within the embodiment is vertically disposed by an angle λ which for the embodiment is approximately  degrees from the cutting edge  of the bed bar knife  when taken in relation to direction of the lower guide plate referring to fig  and fig  the left side and right side respectively of apparatus  is generally shown a motor not shown or like means provides the power necessary to operate apparatus  those skilled in the art will appreciate that the motor can be electrically powered an internal combustion engine andor be remotely located and coupled to apparatus  through a gear box not shown it has been determined however that for the embodiment thusly described the motor must provide an output of at least  horsepower in order to produce firelogs  while operating all the various subassemblies simultaneouslyin the preferred configuration fig  and fig  the motor not shown powered by a frequency drive for speed control directly drives an inch primary spur gear  that is axially mounted on a primary driveshaft  which rotates within enclosure  primary spur gear  in turn engages and drives a cutting assembly gear  which is a inch spur gear cutting assembly gear  is axially mounted on lower shaft  of the cutting assembly adjacent the left side  of enclosure  rotation of cutting assembly gear  rotates lower shaft  and hence lower circular blades  in fig  a lower shaft spur gear  is axially mounted on lower shaft  adjacent the right side  of enclosure  the relationships of these gears can also be seen in fig  through fig  along with first gear housing  and second gear housing  which enhance safety primary spur gear  and driveshaft  are directly behind gear  and shaft  and can not be seen in fig  or fig  yet are in full view in the rear view of fig  lower shaft spur gear  engages and drives upper shaft spur gear  which is attached to upper shaft  adjacent the right side  of enclosure  rotation of upper shaft spur gear  rotates upper shaft  and hence rotates upper circular blades  lower shaft spur gear  and upper shaft spur gear  are identically configured so that the rotational velocities of lower and upper circular blades   are the same in the preferred embodiment lower shaft and upper shaft spur gears   respectively are approximately inches in diameterreferring again to fig  the cutting reel  is driven by spur gear  which is driven by primary spur gear  axial shaft  of cutting reel  includes a gear  adjacent the left side  which is driven by spur gear  which engages primary spur gear  in the preferred configuration gear  of cutting reel  is a spur gear that is configured to provide a rotational velocity of approximately  between lower circular blades  and cutting reel  the  ratio between lower circular blades  and cutting reel  is somewhat critical as it determines the length and size of waxed corrugated cardboard segments  the higher the ratio the smaller the waxed segments  and conversely the lower the ratio the larger the waxed segments primary spur gear  also drives shaft  of conveyor compression auger screw  primary spur gear  engages conveyor compression auger screw spur gear  which is mounted on shaft  conveyor compression auger screw spur gear  preferably is also approximately inches in diameter to allow for the same rotational velocity in conveyor compression auger screw  although gearing mechanisms are disclosed to drive cutting assembly  and conveyor compression auger assembly  those skilled in the art will appreciate that chain and sprocket assemblies not shown belt and pulley assemblies not shown andor a combination of any of the aforementioned can be used to achieve the same objectiveto fabricate artificial firelog  flattened waxed corrugated cardboard boxes in the form of waxed corrugated cardboard sheets  as shown in fig  are fed into channel or opening  until grasped by lower and upper circular blades with teeth   lower and upper circular blades   draw or pull waxed corrugated cardboard sheets  into and meter through channel  while slicing waxed corrugated cardboard sheets  into strips  while simultaneously applying fuzzy frayed edges to the strips as waxed corrugated cardboard strips  pass through and exit channel  cutting blades  on cutting reel  chop waxed corrugated cardboard strips  into waxed corrugated cardboard segments  referring now to fig  the waxed corrugated cardboard segments fall from the cutting reel into hopper  and are guided into opening  of conveyor compression auger assembly  the cardboard segments are then radially disposed to the inner walls of the conical section  where the ¼ riffling  guides the compressed segments b continually forward and through the conical zone  of the log die  the rifling  also insures that the outer layer of the log will have a consistent layer of flattened radially disposed segments these segments are compressed through each flight of the compression auger as the segments reach the final compression push flight they have been arranged flat horizontally longitudinally disposed and helically compressed from the center of the log outward the log die puts the last compression into the log extrusion and forms the received compressed segments into various firelog products a firelog  as manufactured by the embodied apparatus is shown in fig  with a few representative waxed corrugated cardboard segments shown disposed radially on the surface of the log for clarity only a few segments are shown however the log is comprised principally of these waxed corrugated cardboard segments  the firelog  shown additionally contains a rail  which was formed by using a log die containing a longitudinal channel or groove such as the one described in regard to the alternate log die of fig  and fig  rails  within the embodied log are approximately ⅛ to ¼ inches in width and extend approximately ⅛ to ¼ inches above the surface of firelog  rails  ail function similarly to a candlewick and facilitate lighting of the firelog  the rails  also keep any log overwrapping material from sticking onto the surface of the firelog  whereby an airgap is maintained to promote ignition of the firelogreferring to fig  the waxed corrugated cardboard segments a produced by the cutting assembly of the preferred embodiment are approximately ½ to  square inch in size with frayed edges on each of two opposing sides created by the teeth on the pair of cutting blades within the mechanism which performs the slicing operation the wax coating and corrugations of the original waxed corrugated cardboard sheets remain intact within these waxed corrugated cardboard segmentsforeign metallic substances such as staples commonly found with waxed corrugated cardboard sheets may be easily removed by using magnets if this is desired however the apparatus will operate without removing the staples fig  shows the hopper walls  whereupon whose exterior magnetic means may be applied to prevent such metallic substances from entering the conveyor compression augerwaxed corrugated cardboard segments may also be directed from the cutting apparatus to a drying apparatus and then returned to the hopper before entering the conveyor compression augerto fabricate firestarter chips a mix of paper and waxed corrugated cardboard segments are produced by using cutting mechanism within the inventive apparatus referring to fig  paper sheets  preferably with  to  paper are laid over waxed corrugated cardboard sheets  and both are fed into opening  until grasped by lower and upper circular blades   lower and upper circular blades   slice waxed corrugated cardboard sheets  and paper sheets  into waxed corrugated cardboard strips  and paper strips  respectively cutting blades  on cutting reel  chop waxed corrugated cardboard strips  and paper strips  into waxed corrugated cardboard segments a and paper mix  respectively waxed corrugated cardboard segments a and paper mix  are gathered or directed into to a standard bagging machine not shown for packaging the waxed corrugated cardboard segments a and paper mix  as an aggregate firestarter mix composed of approximately  waxed corrugated cardboard segments a and approximately  to  paper mix  those skilled in the art will appreciate that approximately  of waxed corrugated cardboard segments a can be hammermilled into a cottonlike fiber which can be used in lieu of paper mix  this cottonlike fiber promotes rapid ignition when in an uncompressed state such as the firestarter mix however when the hammermilled material is compressed the opposite effect occurs and rapid ignition is preventedfirelogs may be produced by leaving off the above described paper sheets and further processing the waxed corrugated cardboard segments that have been heretofore cut into segments referring to fig  after the uncompressed waxed corrugated cardboard segments a are cut they fall into the hopper  and enter opening  the rotation of conveyor compression screw  transports waxed corrugated cardboard segments a into and through auger housing  conveyor compression screw  rotates and compresses waxed corrugated cardboard segments a along the length of the circular passageway  into compressed waxed corrugated cardboard segments b as the waxed corrugated cardboard segments b being compressed approach the recompression zone  of the log die  the segments b are heated up due to the compression friction and centrifugal force occurring therein this heating propagates uniformly and thereby adheres waxed corrugated cardboard segments b together in a generally interlocking planar fashion this interlocking planar adhesion of segments b gives finished firelog  additional cohesive strength with no cold joints the conveyor compression auger assembly  is operated with regard to speed cooling flow and adjustment so as to maintain the temperature of compressed waxed corrugated cardboard segments b under ° f at temperatures above ° f the “wet glue” used to form the waxed cardboard corrugations can melt resulting in corrugation delamination also the wax used on the waxed cardboard segments a has a blocking point temperature of approximately ° f and a melting point temperature of approximately ° f the heat necessary to form firelog  without melting the wet glue and wax in the corrugated cardboard is generated only by conveyor compression screw  and is typically about ° f to ° f above ambient temperature firelogs  have been found to generally form best between temperatures of approximately ° f and ° f thus requiring an ambient temperature range of approximately ° f to ° f which is well within the range of most factories or manufacturing facilities it has been determined that when the ambient temperature is lower conveyor compression auger assembly  can be run faster and consequently more firelogs  can be produced therefore the ability to vary the ambient temperature of the manufacturing environment is desirable a cooling section as previously described and shown may be applied around the log die to increase the production capability by further cooling and controlling the temperaturemaintaining the integrity of the cellular structure  as shown in fig  is essential for allowing oxygen and wax to flow through the waxed segments to provide for easier ignition and more efficient burning of the firelog  of fig  the centrifugal force within the conveyer compression auger assembly urges segments radially outward to the periphery of firelog  so as to lay “flat” along the outer surface of the conical auger housing wherein upon compression these segments become radially disposed within firelog  being radially disposed the waxed corrugated cardboard segments are free to expand when heated thereby providing a log which burns more efficiently and in a manner resembling genuine wood bark waxed corrugated cardboard segments are compressed within the apparatus by a factor of approximately five to eight the amount of compression as set by the conveyor compression auger assembly is a determiner of fuel density and a factor in regulating the burn rate of the logadditional wax or glue is not required within a firelog formed within the current invention due to the unique configuration of the conveyor compression auger assembly whose functioning includes compressing radially disposing and interlocking the waxed corrugated cardboard segments into a firelog extrusion that does not easily break apart if desired however openings not shown can be placed within conical section of the conveyor compression auger assembly so that extra liquid wax can be added to waxed corrugated cardboard segments this extra wax can be used to achieve longer burn time greater btus or to reduce friction within the production process the addition of wax or a wax replacement substance may also be used with nonwaxed corrugated cardboard sheets or paper if used as the firelog  burns corrugations  of the cellular structure  on the waxed corrugated cardboard segments b expand to c fig  allowing oxygen and wax to permeate throughout firelog  resulting in a clean and efficient burning firelog  the outermost segments of firelog  fall off and the next outermost layer continues burningan outer coating or cover not shown can be extruded along with firelog  by adding bleed holes on conical section  to allow for the introduction of plastic or hot glues into the conveyor compression to form the outer coating or cover for firelog  during compression and extrusion a means can also be provided wherein the plastic or hot glue is inserted beyond exit  of die  the outer coating or cover gives the log structure a significantly greater compressive strength thereby allowing the production of a log product extrusion whose outer coating may be made sufficiently durable so that the extrusion can be used for posts pillars or the likereferring now to fig  through fig  a firelog  of fig  manufactured by apparatus  of the present invention is generally shown as will be seen firelog  is a longitudinallyshaped structure that comprises waxed corrugated cardboard segments b which have been radially disposed and densely compacted together the basic material used to form firelog  is waxed corrugated cardboard sheets as found within ordinary waxed corrugated cardboard boxes the waxed corrugated cardboard sheets are cut into small segments a of fig  the waxed corrugated cardboard segments are preferably cut to a size between ½ square inch to  square inch in size to produce a decorative burn aspect of firelog  alternatively one can use waxed corrugated cardboard segments a smaller that the preferred range but this would result in a higher manufacturing cost and the possible introduction of cold jointsit is essential the waxed corrugated cardboard segments a used retain a cellular structure  the cellular structure must remain intact in the form of corrugations  of cardboard material which allow air to flow through the waxed corrugated cardboard segment a which thereby results in an efficient and prolonged burn the waxed corrugated cardboard segments a additionally have been found to burn in a manner wherein they may be used as firestarter chips since waxed corrugated cardboard segments a are fabricated from waxed corrugated cardboard sheets they contain a first substantially planar member  and a second substantially planar member  covering corrugations  containing a cellular structure waxed corrugated cardboard segments a are compressed to a ratio preferably between  and  resulting in a compressed waxed corrugated cardboard segment b as depicted in fig  the range between  and  has been determined to be the preferred compression ratio as compressing waxed corrugated cardboard segment  beyond this range would cause damage to the cellular structure  thus effectively eliminating the effect of corrugations  after being compressed in the conveyor compression auger assembly waxed corrugated cardboard segments b are densely packed together during an extrusion process through log die  and then cut in generally evenlyspaced sections to form firelogs such as firelog  having a generally cylindricalshaped structure biomass may be added in with waxed corrugated cardboard segments  during the compression process including but not limited to saw dust almond shells walnut shells peanut shells olive pits cherry pits coal the addition of such biomass provides firelog  with desired aromatic characteristics when firelogs  are burned biomass can also serve to increase or decrease the friction level within conveyor compression auger assembly during compression of waxed corrugated cardboard segments fig  depicts the compressed waxed corrugated cardboard segments b as firelog begins to burn corrugations  then expand due to the heat allowing air to efficiently flow throughout the segments which expand to c of fig  as they burn on the outside of the firelogreferring finally to fig  a flow chart  of the manufacturing process for a firelog is generally depicted the first step  involves cutting waxed corrugated cardboard sheet into segments the second step  involves compressing waxed corrugated cardboard segments to a ratio between  and  in the third step  waxed corrugated cardboard segments are extruded into a continuous log structure the fourth and final step  involves cutting the continuous log structure into individual firelogsaccordingly it will be seen that this invention converts standard waxed corrugated cardboard sheets into artificial firelogs by slicing the waxed corrugated cardboard sheets into strips cutting waxed corrugated cardboard strips into waxed corrugated cardboard segments and compressing waxed corrugated cardboard segments while providing for radial disposition and interlocking of the segments to form an artificial firelog although the description above contains many specificities these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of the presently preferred embodiments of this invention thus the scope of this invention should be
