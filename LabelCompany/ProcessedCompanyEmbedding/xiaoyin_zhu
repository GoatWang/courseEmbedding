search for technology  research initiative funding – imaging xiaoyin zhu in rongguang liang’s group we do optical and mechanical design of endoscopes and system testing colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the united states colonoscopy is the preferred method to detect and remove precancerous polyps the dualview colonoscope we proposed can illuminate and image the colon in forward and omnidirectional backward directions without any obstructed view allowing the polyps that are hidden from view to be easily seen while keeping the overall size of the system as small as  millimeters in diameter in liang’s group we are also investigating the possibility of using different gel materials such as polydimethylsiloxane pdms optical encapsulation gel and uv glues to replace one or multiple elements in the optical imaging system these materials are cheap and easy to make if the optical and mechanical properties of these materials could meet the requirements of our imaging system we could make the endoscopy system smaller and lighter in weight with less cost image taken through theduelview colonoscope trif imaging initiative chair jim schwiegerling chair  trif imaging
