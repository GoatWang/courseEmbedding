united states bankruptcy court for the western district of texas austin division chapter  case no  joint administration requested § § § § § § § § in re xtreme power inc et al debtors § § § state of texas travis county a affidavit of ken hashman in support of debtors’ first day pleadings known all men by these presents introduction and overview of the proposed sale process  “my name is ken hashman i am the chief financial officer “cfo” of the debtors xtreme power inc “xpi” xtreme power systems llc “xps” and xtreme power grove llc “xpg” collectively referred to as “debtors” or “xtreme power” the debtors and debtorsinpossession in the above referenced recently filed chapter  bankruptcy cases  except as otherwise indicated all facts set forth in this affidavit are based upon my personal knowledge my discussions with other members of the debtors’ management team and the debtors’ advisors my review of relevant documents and information concerning the debtors’ operations financial affairs and restructuring initiatives or my opinions based upon my experience and knowledge if called as a witness i could and would testify competently to the facts set forth in this declaration i am authorized to submit this declaration on behalf of the debtors affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of   the debtors commenced these chapter  cases to try and maximize the value of the company through a sale process that commenced several months before the bankruptcy filing the debtors believe the process is designed to maximize the value of the company the debtors began exploring a sale process that would maximize the debtors’ value months before the chapter  filing as explained further below the debtors’ operations were stymied by a liquidity crisis which in turn made an out of court sale process unworkable in fact the debtors’ lack of liquidity threatened the viability of any sale process in or out of court accordingly the debtors’ board of directors authorized its financial advisors the gordian group to solicit bids for in or out of court financing  the debtors’ solicitation of financing yielded two prospective lenders after a series of vigorous negotiations the debtors determined that the structure and terms of horizon technology finance corporation’s “horizon” ultimate proposal for a dip credit facility best served the debtors’ goal of providing liquidity for the proposed sale process the other proposed lender acknowledged that it could not improve on the terms of its original proposal there is no other available financing secured or unsecured known available to the debtors  under the terms of the dip credit facility horizon will provide an initial advance of up to  million in weekly advances consistent with the approved budget as defined in the dip term sheet the “initial dip availability” on a senior secured basis that will based on the debtors’ projections fund the debtors’ operations while in chapter  through the end of february in connection with the initial dip availability horizon will serve as the initial stalking horse the “back up sale transaction” while the debtors and the gordian group actively search for a substitute stalking horse if the debtors obtain a substitute stalking horse                                                                                                                   this amount may be increased by the svb cure payment of approximately  which will be announced at the hearing   affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of  by february   date to be verified horizon will advance an additional  million in weekly advances consistent with the approved budget together with the initial dip availability the “dip availability” to the debtors on a senior secured basis to permit the debtors to conduct a competitive bidding process with the substitute stalking horse in hand if no substitute stalking horse or substitute dip lender as defined in the dip credit facility is obtained by february   date to be verified then horizon shall have no further funding obligation under the terms of the dip loan after february   and the back up sale transaction will close  the proposed dip financing and related sale framework is the best option to maximize the value of the debtors’ estates under the circumstances it provides the needed liquidity for the debtors to obtain a substitute stalking horse or a substitute dip lender either of which events will extend the sale process if a substitute stalking horse is located the bid will be at a value sufficient to pay the debtors’ seniormost secured lenders silicon valley bank “svb” and horizon moreover locating a substitute stalking horse triggers horizon’s obligation to fund the second tranche of the dip credit facility that will provide further needed liquidity for a competitive sale process further the dip credit facility provides another layer of flexibility for the sale process in the event that the debtors do not obtain a substitute stalking horse by february   the debtors may nonetheless continue its sale process for an extended period subject to deadlines if it obtains a financing commitment from another lender whose liens will be junior to the liens securing svb’s prepetition indebtedness and horizon’s pre and postpetition indebtedness the “substitute dip lender” on or before                                                                                                                   svb’s debt is approximately  and although primed by the horizon dip facility the it holds as security for a letter of credit that is described in more detail below   debtor’s dip budget was just revised to provide for cure of the principal and interest default of approximately  also the horizon dip facility does not prime sbv’s lien on a  million cd affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of  february   date to be verified that closes no later than february   horizon will have no further funding obligation with respect to the extended process and its collateral may not be surcharged under  usc § c for any expenses incurred after february   if the process is extended by the substitute dip lender process  if in the event that the debtors do not locate a substitute stalking horse or a substitute dip lender by february   date to be verified the debtors will sell substantially all of their assets to horizon under the back up sale transaction with a february   closing the back up sale transaction is not the debtors’ desired transaction nor upon information and belief does horizon desire to acquire the debtors’ assets as a consequence of the back up sale transaction  the debtors goal in these cases is to utilize the liquidity provided by the dip loans to maintain the going concern value of the company while they seek a higher and better offer from a strategic investor a vigorous marketing process has been initiated by gordian and the debtors believe that most if not all of their secured lenders fully support this process which they expect will take somewhere from  –  days and which includes a motion to approve bid procedures that contemplates further marketing a bidding process and an auction the debtors expect to file the bid procedures motion shortly and will request a hearing on the bid procedures motion and will seek entry of the back up sale transaction order within  days of the petition date  the debtors have filed several first day pleadings that seek relief necessary to avoid immediate and irreparable harm to the debtors as they pursue their overall financial restructuring by allowing them to continue their operations and minimize disruptions to their business that could otherwise result from the commencement of the chapter  cases affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of  specifically the first day pleadings seek relief allowing the debtors to a stabilize and maintain their business operations through among other things the use of postpetition financing and cash collateral b limit disruption to the debtors’ business by continuing the use of their prepetition cash management system c preserve their going concern value by obtaining approval to pay wages and salaries earned in the pre petition

monitor and control the systems remotely from xps’s facility in kyle xps’s expertise allows it to ensure its systems integrate seamlessly with the power grids to which they are connected and that the

xact is proprietary and confidential and while there is no patent for the overall xact system certain sub units of xact may be protected by patent issued or pending xact along with the company’s engineers that write maintain and operate it is the company’s core competency and most valuable asset however because the xact system was internally developed and the costs were not capitalized it does not appear on the company’s books as an asset just as the value of the company’s expert staff is not captured by normal accounting methods  xpg holds a license from horizon batteries llc to manufacture an advanced lead acid battery that xtreme power previously used in some of its energy storage systems and also sold to third parties however xpg shut down its battery manufacturing

farm in hawaii in the building housing the battery energy storage system manufactured by the company the building and the energy storage system were destroyed by the fire the root cause of that fire remains under investigation until such time as root cause is determined it is not possible to determine what if any liability the company may have as a result of this loss for which the company has insurance coverage in any event the company believes publicity related to the fire has negatively impacted project bookings  the company revised its business plan to reflect revenue and expense reductions consistent with market conditions and began to look at restructuring its costs at about the same time the company was pursuing its proposed series d round of equity financing but was unable affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of  to generate sufficient interest and so to support the company’s operational cash needs the company engaged in a series of bridge financings with convertible notes since  the company has raised approximately  million in this manner  by october  various debt and lease agreements were in default and the company was in default with its secured lenders on revenue and other operating covenants the defaults were dealt with by another round of bridge financing but the company continued to forecast negative cash flow from operations and the company’s management and board of directors who have closely monitored the impact of these conditions determined to address potential alternatives with the assistance of various professionals and outside advisors including gordian group llc “gordian group” and roth capital partners llc  several offers for purchase and financing arrangements were considered and the company was working with a large public company towards a transaction that the company believed had potential to be a favorable when the proposed purchaser withdrew from negotiations for reason unknown to the company another large public company that had expressed interest in a transaction also notified the company in december that it would not be pursuing the transaction  an attempt to obtain further bridge financing fell through in late december and so in early january the company’s board determined that serious consideration must now be given to filing a chapter  to protect the company’s going concern value for a period of time long enough to effect a sale of the company an option that the board had been considering for several months  a number of lenders were approached for interim financing and financing packages with two leading candidates were negotiated in earnest on a competitive basis the affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of  board chose to proceed with what it believes is the clearly superior proposal which was a proposed interim financing that would permit the company to continue its marketing efforts prior to a bankruptcy filing however the company was informed late last week that the proposed lender would not proceed outside of bankruptcy the company went back to both potential lenders and after additional intensive negotiations arrived at the dip lenderstalking horse arrangements with horizon financial that is being presented to the court for approval  in the meantime gordian group continued its efforts to secure a purchaser for the company according to gordian group as of january  they had identified a universe of  potential buyers had contacted  and heard back from  sent out  “teasers” have  parties signed up on confidentiality agreements to review company data and have confirmed at least  of those parties have already accessed the company’s virtual data room  several other events contributed to the company’s decision to seek protection in chapter  many of the company’s secured debt obligations had matured on december   in early january the company received a demand letter from the lawyers for an investor for payment in full of the obligation that matured december  the company’s two most senior secured lenders silicon valley bank and horizon financial asked the company to submit itself to an assignment for the benefit of creditors in california which management opposed the company’s operations team had become concerned about the company’s ability to deliver project milestones on the company’s currently booked projects one of the company’s production partners refused to commit to support that was needed for an ongoing project because of their expressed fears that the company was facing financial difficulties and would be unable to meet its obligations affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of   on january  the company received a notice of default from the lawyers for its landlord at its leased building at  goforth road although the landlord has given the company verbal assurance that it does not intend to proceed in a manner damaging to the company g current financial situation  as of the bankruptcy filing the company is virtually out of cash however it has  million of awarded contracts in development as well as one contract pending in puerto rico that if secured will result in bookings of  million one in the us that would result in bookings of approximately  thousand and one in the uk that would result in bookings of approximately  million debtors believe their bankruptcy filings and the processes contemplated will help them realize the potential for these contracts and thus enhance their going concern value  over the last month management has drastically reduced the employee head count in incremental steps to preserve capital along with implementing pay cuts to regular employees an total deferment of compensation for senior management after paying the retainers to bankruptcy and special counsel that they require to file the company in chapter  and assist a sale transaction the company has only about  in cash h need for first day relief  contemporaneously herewith the debtors filed a number of motions all described below the “first day pleadings” seeking orders granting various forms of relief intended to stabilize the debtors’ business operations facilitate the efficient administration of the chapter  cases and which are necessary to avoid the immediate and irreparable harm to the debtors i believe that the relief requested in each of the first day pleadings is in the best affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of  interests of the debtors’ estates their creditors and all other parties in interest and will enable the debtors to continue to operate their businesses in chapter  without disruption accordingly on behalf of the debtors i respectfully submit that all should be approved a   complex  case  treatment  the debtors have total debts of more than  million and there are more than fifty  parties in interest in these cases joint administration b  the debtors request entry of orders in each of their cases directing the joint administration of these cases the debtors believe that many if not most of the motions applications and other pleadings filed in these chapter  cases will relate to relief sought jointly by all of the debtors for example virtually all of the relief sought by the debtors in the first day pleadings is sought on behalf of all of the debtors counsel has explained to me that joint administration of the debtors’ chapter  cases for procedural purposes only on a single docket will ease the administrative burdens on the court and reduce the cost of prosecuting these cases by allowing the debtors’ cases to be administered as a single joint proceeding instead of  independent chapter  cases   c   cash  collateral  debtor xps has only a small amount of cash collateral and the other debtors have virtually none the debtors’ operations in chapter  will be financed primarily through the dip loan from horizon the only other entity with an interest in xps’s cash collateral is svb debtors believe that svb will consent to its use of its cash collateral but if it will not requests that the court permit it to use such cash collateral affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of   the debtor requires the ability to use cash and the proceeds of existing accounts receivable to maintain the operation of its businesses and preserve its value as a going concern these essential items however constitute part of the collateral for the loans made to the debtor under the prepetition loan documents with svb and therefore may not be used in support of the debtors ongoing business activities absent compliance with section  of the bankruptcy code the debtors have no other source of secured or unsecured borrowing that could replace the need for the use of this cash collateral without authorization to use the cash collateral under section cb of the bankruptcy code the debtor would be left without a small but important source of working capital   d   bank  accounts  and  cash  management  debtors have a total of six bank accounts as follows acct name xps

daily operating account for xpg duke letter of credit  performance guarantee xps typically receive payments from its customers into the xps cash collateral  account and then transfers those funds to the xps operating account which is then used to make payments to creditors for payroll taxes and the like affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of   debtor is aware of only four outstanding checks and will issue stop pay requests to the bank  xpi’s sam pledge account is used solely as a holding account for a cd owned by xpi which cd is pledged as collateral to svb to secure a letter of credit “lc” in the amount of  million that the bank issued on behalf of xps to secure a contract obligation of xps to duke energy it is possible that xps’s contract obligations to duke energy could exceed the face amount of the lc and the cd although the eventual result depends on energy prices thus the debtors reserve all their rights to further investigate the amount of the potential obligations and whether or not the cd may eventually be redeemed however because the lc is in place until december of  and the cd is pledged as security for the lc and is in the possession of the bank that issued the lc the value of the cd is not currently available to the debtors for use for any other purpose  debtors utilize various forms and checks in the operation of their business although most of the debtor’s business is conducted electronically via e mail and in the case of banking via wire transfers e  schedules extension consolidated matrix and consolidated list of  largest unsecured creditors the debtors request an additional  days to file their schedules of assets and liabilities schedules of executory contracts and unexpired leases and statements of financial affairs collectively the “schedules and statements”  i am the sole primary source of most of the information needed by debtors’ counsel to prepare the schedules and statements and i am currently overwhelmed with requests for information requests for preparation of budgets and all the other day to day and hour to hour information needed to prepare the bankruptcy filings respond to inquiries from the proposed dip affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of  lender and other creditors and potential investors and purchasers not to mention continuing to manage the ongoing financial affairs of an operating business it is simply impossible for me to locate provide to counsel and review for accuracy in  days all the data that goes into the schedules and statements  while the debtors with the help of their attorneys are diligently preparing the schedules and remaining statements the debtors’ primary focus thus far has been preparing for the filing of their chapter  cases securing dip financing and maintaining momentum in its sale process in view of the amount of work entailed in completing the schedules and statements and the competing demands upon the debtors’ employees and professionals to assist in efforts to stabilize business operations during the initial postpetition period the debtors will not be able to complete the schedules and all of the statements properly and accurately either within the required fourteenday time period provided for under bankruptcy rule c or by the petition date as respectively required  accordingly the debtors request that the deadlines by which the debtors must file their schedules and statements be extended by sixteen days to february   in view of the above the amount of information that must be assembled and analyzed and the significant amount of employee time that must be devoted to complete the schedules and statements ample cause exists for the requested extension g dip financing motion  the debtors seek authority to obtain postpetition financing in the aggregate amount of up to  million the “dip availability” or “dip credit facility” subject to the terms and conditions of the debtorinpossession credit agreement the “dip credit agreement” affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of  and collectively with all agreements documents and instruments delivered or executed in connection therewith the “financing documents” between the debtors and horizon  xps’s payroll is due on thursday january   and it cannot be made absent the initial dip availability funding thus the debtors requested that the court schedule the interim hearing to consider this motion on january   and the court granted the request it is anticipated that the proposed the initial dip credit facility will enable the debtors to pay their ongoing operating expenses and the administrative claims of the estates through the end of february if applicable the remaining dip availability or financing provided by the substitute dip lender will provide sufficient funds to conduct a competitive §  sale process  the terms and conditions of the dip credit facility shall be embodied in a final order and the dip credit agreement the debtors will seek a hearing on the final dip facility order within  days a summary of the terms of the proposed dip credit facility can be found in the dip financing motion  the debtors have been unable to procure the credit required to fund the administration of their estates in the form of unsecured credit on better terms than those offered by the dip lender the debtors therefore have no choice but to seek credit on a secured basis in exchange for the granting of liens on the dip collateral  since prior to the commencement of these cases the debtors have been confronted with the significant challenge of securing funding to pay for the expenses of the operation of their businesses as well as for the administration of their estates if the debtors cannot secure funding to pay payroll taxes salaries and other estate expenses then the debtors cannot reasonably accomplish a sale of their business or otherwise successfully reorganize affidavit of ken hashman page  hcm doc filed  entered   main document pg  of   the debtors have negotiated the terms of this dip credit facility in good faith and at arm’slength to fund the administrative expenses of the debtors’ estates i through the end of february if the debtors do not obtain a substitute stalking horse bidder or ii through the end of the section  sale process subject to certain deadlines if the debtors do obtain a substitute stalking horse bidder the proposed postpetition financing will ensure that the debtors have the funds necessary to pay taxes and salaries and to the extent possible to preserve the debtors’ going concern value through the sale process the debtors’ regular cash flow is not sufficient to pay the ongoing operating and administrative expenses accordingly the debtors have been unable to obtain funds on an unsecured basis  furthermore the debtors with the assistance of gordian group have diligently sought financing from sources other than the dip lender the debtors believe that in today’s market debtorinpossession or “dip” financing on the same or similar terms of the dip credit facility is not available from traditional thirdparty institutional lenders the terms of the only other prospective lender’s financing proposal was not in the debtors’ business judgment on better terms after diligent efforts the debtors’ best business judgment is that the dip lender is the best source of financing and the dip credit facility is on the best terms for these debtors h i omitted omitted j  employee
