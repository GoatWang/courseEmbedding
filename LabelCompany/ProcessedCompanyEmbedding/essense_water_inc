statements the results of operations for the period ended november   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year note   going concern the companys financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations in order to continue as a going concern the company will need among other things additional capital resources managements plan is to obtain such resources for the company by obtaining capital from management and other investors sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity andor debt financing however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern    note   subsequent events the company has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were

assets                      total liabilities              shareholders equity               liquidity and capital resources our cash balance at november   was  in order to achieve and meet the objectives of our business plan we will require additional funding the company had planned to receive sufficient funding its offering of registered shares pursuant to a registration statement filed on form s which became effective on june   the company was unsuccessful in this endeavor failing to raise the minimum level of funds called for by the offering as a result the offering was cancelled by the company on november   the company will thus continue to utilize funds provided by our sole officerdirector who has agreed to advance funds for operations until such time as we receive sufficient funding from other sources however we have no formal commitment arrangements or legal obligation with him to advance or loan funds to us as of november   our officerdirector has loaned and paid expenses directly on the companys behalf totaling  these funds are payable upon demand and bear no interest as a result of its unsuccessful offering of shares per the s stock offering the company will be focusing efforts to raise additional funding by other means such as a private placements of its shares or by another stock offering in the meantime it will be relying on loansadvances by its funder as previously discussed to keep it operational plan of operation our plan of operation for the  to  months consists of the following stepsstages  seek additional funding by means other than through the s stock offering that had been the companys focus over the previous six month period the focus now will be upon private placements of its shares in return for capital possible loans from others or another stock offering and possibly moving forward by remaining selffunded by the founder while the company had hoped to begin testing and formulation of its product once it received the minimum level of funding from the s offering it will now not be able to begin any level of operations much beyond product formulation until adequate outside funding is obtained management hopes that additional funding can be successfully raised within the next  day timeframe but until such time as additional funds are actually obtained the company will have little time to work on or further other development in its business plan as the efforts of the companys sole officerdirector will be focused on raising additional funds  formulation of our drink product will be of foremost importance in the early stages of the companys business cycle as stated earlier the drink will be formulated with added ingredients with the idea of making it better for you than plain water we will most likely endeavor to develop one basic formula rather than several formulas and then offer that formula in a few basic flavors    efforts in this stage will likely be started once additional funding has been successfully raised we expect this to be completed over the next three months once additional funds have been raised this stage will most likely take three to six months to complete  once our drink formula has been somewhat developed and decided upon we will begin working simultaneously on several other key areas in the furtherance of our business plan in no particular order these areas of

and distribution resources than the company will important factors that will affect our ability to compete successfully include taste and flavor of products trade and consumer promotions the development of a new unique cutting edge product attractive and different packaging branded product advertising and pricing each of these factors will be taken into consideration as we proceed with our business plan the company will also be competing to secure distributors who will agree to market our product over those of our competitors provide stable and reliable distribution and secure
