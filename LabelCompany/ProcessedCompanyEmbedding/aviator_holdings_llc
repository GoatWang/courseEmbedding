spare parts redistribution market is highlyfragmented competition is generally based on price availability of product and quality including traceability our major competitors include aar corp aero controls corp solair inc the memphis group and aviation sales company there is also substantial competition both domestically and overseas from smaller independent dealers who generally participate in niche markets several of our competitors have greater financial and other resources the jet turbine engine and jet turbine aircraft market is currently dominated by various financial institutions such as ge capital cit group and international lease finance corp as well as the major competitors from the spare parts redistribution market the market also includes many smaller entities who engage in transactions on an infrequent basis company description general aviation holdings group is a holding company and currently has no operations other than the ownership of  of the outstanding capital stock of aviation holdings international aviation holdings group was incorporated in january  as a delaware corporation and whollyowned subsidiary of eyeq networking inc a colorado corporation formed in may  in february  eyeq networking inc merged with and into aviation holdings group with aviation holdings group surviving as the newly merged entity under the name of eyeq networking inc in september  aviation holdings group changed its name from eyeq networking inc to aviation holdings group inc we acquired approximately  of the issued and outstanding capital stock of aviation holdings international through a series of share exchanges in which holders of aviation holdings international common stock exchanged it for newlyissued shares of aviation holdings group common stock we are in the aircraft and engine spare parts redistribution business and specialize in the sale lease exchange and purchase of technical spare parts for fixedwing commercial jet transport aircraft manufactured by boeing mcdonnell douglas airbus and lockheed as part of this business we provide customers with inventory management services including new product distribution technical purchasing maintenance and repair management consignment marketing and purchaseleaseback of technical spare parts inventory we also pursue opportunities involving the purchase sale and lease of jet turbine engines jet turbine aircraft and related aviation industry equipment industry overview the aircraft spare parts redistribution market includes sellers of parts other than parts manufacturers this market is highly fragmented with a limited number of large wellcapitalized companies selling a broad range of aircraft spare parts and many smaller competitors servicing particular segments of the aircraft spare parts industry we believe that significant trends affecting the aircraft spare parts market will increase our overall size and at the same time eliminate some market participants and cause consolidation in the industry due to the inability of some participants to compete efficiently these trends are growth in market for aircraft spare parts boeings  market outlook estimates that o the worldwide fleet of commercial passenger airplanes will more than double from  airplanes at the end of  to  airplanes by  and o cargo jet aircraft will increase from  airplanes in  to  airplanes by  seventy percent of the airplanes delivered to cargo operators are expected to be used aircraft which were converted from commercial passenger service further the number of planes in service for more than  years is continuing to increase and these older planes are the primary market for parts redistributors finally cost considerations are forcing many airlines and repair and maintenance facilities to utilize aircraft spare parts sold by redistributors instead of purchasing new parts for inventory we believe that all of these factors will increase the demand for aircraft spare parts from the redistribution market increased outsourcing of inventory management function airlines incur substantial expenditures in connection with fuel labor and aircraft ownership during the last decade airlines have come under increasing pressure from consumers to reduce air travel costs although some expenditures required to operate an airline are beyond the direct control of airline operators eg the price of fuel and labor costs we believe that obtaining replacement parts from the redistribution market and outsourcing inventory management functions are steps airlines will take to manage these functions with less expense and greater efficiency increasing emphasis on traceability due to concerns regarding unapproved aircraft spare parts regulatory authorities now require airlines to maintain stricter parts documentation this requirement has in turn been extended by airlines to the spare parts vendors the sophistication required to track the history of an inventory consisting of thousands of aircraft spare parts is considerable and has required companies to invest significantly in information systems technology on march   our quality control systems were certified by the airline suppliers association as meeting its quality system standards and faa guidelines increased consignment certain of our customers adjust inventory levels on a periodic basis by disposing of excess aircraft spare parts traditionally larger airlines have used internal personnel to manage such dispositions we believe that major airlines and other owners of aircraft spare parts are increasingly entering into longterm consignment agreements with redistributors in order to concentrate on their core businesses and to more effectively redistribute their excess parts inventories by consigning inventories to a redistributor such as us customers are able to distribute their aircraft spare parts to a larger number of prospective inventory buyers allowing the customer to maximize the value of its inventory consignment also enables us to offer for sale significant parts inventory at minimal capital cost to us increased leasing we believe that cost considerations will cause airlines to lease rather than purchase more spare parts and engines this would benefit us by o providing a steady income stream over a period of time from lease payments o upon termination of the lease we would regain the part or engine for subsequent sale and o provide the opportunity to obtain additional financing operations our core business is buying and selling aircraft and engine spare parts we purchase spare parts from numerous unaffiliated sources including airlines original equipment manufacturers and other parts distributors we have also pursued opportunities to purchase and sell related aviation industry equipment for example aviation holdings international acquired a  interest in a dc flight simulator and related support package and software we also provide valueadded inventory management services to our customers we believe that inventory management services provide significant opportunities for expansion of our business in the future we also intend to develop business as a redistributor of turbine jet engines and become involved in the purchase sale and lease of jet turbine aircraft and engines aircraft and engine spare parts aircraft and engine spare parts can be categorized by their ongoing ability to be repaired and returned to service the general categories are as follows o rotable means a part which is removed periodically as dictated by an operators maintenance procedures or on an as needed basis and is typically repaired or overhauled and reused an indefinite number of times an important type of rotable is a life limited part which means it has a predetermined designated number of allowable flight hours andor flights after which it is rendered unusable o repairable means a part limited by the number of times it can be repaired before it must be discarded and o expendable means a part which is used and not thereafter repaired for further use rotable and repairable aircraft and engine spare parts are further classified as o factory new means parts that have never been installed or used which are purchased from manufacturers or their authorized distributors aircraft manufacturers and engine manufacturers o new surplus means parts that have never been installed or used which are purchased from excess stock of airlines repair facilities or other redistributors o overhauled means a part that has been completely disassembled inspected repaired reassembled and tested by a licensed repair facility o serviceable means a part repaired by an approved maintenance center that is functional and meets any manufacturer or time and cycle restrictions applicable to it and o as removed means a part that requires functional testing repair or overhaul by a licensed facility prior to being returned to service in an aircraft or engine a factory new new surplus overhauled or serviceable part designation indicates that the part can be immediately utilized on an aircraft inventory purchases and sales our daily operations encompass inventory sales brokering and exchanging aircraft spare parts we advertise our available inventories held for sale or exchange on the inventory locator service ils the airline inventory redistribution system airs and bcom electronic databases buyers of aircraft spare parts can access the ils airs and bcom databases and determine the companies which have the desired inventory available we estimate that  of our daily sales activity results from an ils airs or bcom inquiry all major airlines and repair agencies subscribe to one or more of these databases and accordingly we maintain continual online direct access with them ils airs and bcom do not however list price information relating to particular parts the ability to properly evaluate and price spare parts and to predict competitive supply and demand trends derives from management experience in the industry we are currently developing an internet web site that will describe in detail the parts and services we offer we typically have over  line items in stock we monitor market availability pricing and historical data on a continuous basis we sell new overhauled and serviceable replacement parts from our inventory and buy them at the request of its customers against a specific order we usually purchase parts for our own account and sell them to our customers for the twelve months ended december   and the nine months ended september   aviation holdings internationals total revenues were approximately as follows  from inventory sales  from inventory sales  from engine sales and  from engine sales and  from consignment sales  from consignment sales inventory management services we provide a number of inventory management services to our customers these services assist airlines in downsizing their inventory management operations thus enabling them to utilize their capital more efficiently and reduce costs we believe we can provide an inventory management program geared to any particular customers requirements such programs would be supported by our operating agreements with various airlines and independent repair agencies we do not charge separately for these services but consider them to be a marketing advantage to our inventory sales consignment by consigning inventories to a redistributor such as us consignors are able to distribute their aircraft spare parts to a larger number of prospective inventory buyers allowing the consignor to maximize the value of its inventory consignment also enables us to sell a broad range of parts at minimal capital cost we anticipate that revenues from consignment will increase as a percentage of total revenues in the future purchasing services we purchase spare parts on behalf of smaller and startup airlines this service allows our customers to take advantage of our greater purchasing power repair management services information systems technology quality and logistics systems and industry expertise we do not charge separately for these services but consider them to be a marketing tool for our inventory sales asian operations while the majority of our operations are conducted in the united states we also operate in asia and the pacific rim directly and through a joint venture with a third party and a number of subsidiaries these asian operations currently account for approximately  of our gross revenues on a consolidated basis and we intend to continue to expand them the asian operations are supervised by simon chiang vice president for asia and the pacific rim from our miami headquarters business is conducted through a number of entities controlled by us that share employees and office facilities there are two employees in hong kong one in shenyang and one in beijing the bulk of the asian operations consist of business similar to our core operations in the united states and europe we intend to expand the asian operations to include other lines of business related to aviation pasco international aviation

aviation regulatory authority in the world two majority owned subsidiaries of aviation holdings international aerolink flight systems ltd a hong kong corporation and aerolink flight system inc a florida corporation collectively aerolink act as china airlines global marketing representative outside of taiwan to date we have recognized  in revenue from aerolink credit facilities on august   aviation holdings international entered into a credit agreement with comerica bank comerica whereby comerica agreed to extend a revolving line of credit to aviation holdings international in an amount not to exceed  the revolving line of credit is intended to fund if necessary working capital needs such as inventory purchases and subject to comericas approval strategic acquisitions the funds advanced to aviation holdings international by comerica are secured by the assets of aviation holdings international and may not at any time exceed the sum of a  of aviation holdings internationals eligible accounts receivable and b  of aviation holdings internationals eligible inventory as of november   aviation holdings international had an aggregate availability of approximately  million and an outstanding balance due to comerica under the revolving line of credit of approximately  million strategy we believe that we can become a low cost leader in the redistribution market as well as in the inventory management services industry by combining its managerial experience with increased capital and continuing to build upon its present operations the essential elements of our business strategy are internal growth we seek to increase our operating revenues and operating income through continued customer penetration in our existing markets and expansion into new markets we intend to achieve such growth by continuing to increase the size and scope of our inventory and by continuing to expand our marketing efforts worldwide we will also expand our inventory management leasing and consignment services to allow our customers to reduce their costs of operations by outsourcing some or all of their inventory management and supply functions and to take advantage of opportunities to maximize the value of their spare parts inventory we will seek to establish and maintain close working relationships with our customers and to become their vendor of choice capitalize on large bulk purchase opportunities although opportunities to purchase large inventories in bulk in the aircraft spare parts industry cannot be predicted historically they become available on a regular basis bulk purchase opportunities arise when o airlines in order to reduce capital requirements sell large amounts of inventory in a single transaction o inventories of aircraft spare parts are sold in conjunction with asset sales or bankruptcy proceedings or o when operators upgrade their fleet in these situations we can obtain large inventories of aircraft spare parts at a lower cost than can ordinarily be obtained by purchasing on an individual basis this results generally in higher gross margins on sales of such parts as of september   we had successfully completed approximately eight bulk inventory purchases in excess of  we believe that due to our experience and as a result of additional capital we will be able to complete an increased number of larger bulk purchases purchase and sale of jet turbine engines and aircraft we believe that with sufficient financial resources we would be in a position to increase our activity in the market for the purchase and sale of jet turbine engines and aircraft this market is extremely competitive and capital intensive we feel however that our management has the expertise and industry contacts to make prudent purchases which are the key to profitability in this market pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses we will also seek acquisitions of other companies assets or product lines that would complement or expand our existing aircraft spare parts redistribution and inventory management services business we believe that such acquisitions will enable us to achieve economies of scale and expand the product and service lines available to our customers we are currently evaluating a number of acquisition opportunities including several faa certified aircraft part repair facilities no commitments or binding agreements have been entered into to date and accordingly no assurance can be given that any of the acquisitions currently being considered will be consummated diversification we are interested in contracting with manufacturers of specialty products that could diversify our product line new product distribution agreements would allow us to exploit our established network of customers while providing a valueadded service to smaller manufacturers who lack marketing expertise and distribution capabilities on a cost basis such contracts prove to be lucrative for us as we are in a position to reap

be subject to new and more stringent regulatory requirements in that regard we closely monitor the faa and industry trade groups in an attempt to understand how possible future regulations might impact us see risk factors  stricter government regulations could reduce the value of our inventory andor require significant expenditures an important factor in the aircraft and engine spare parts
