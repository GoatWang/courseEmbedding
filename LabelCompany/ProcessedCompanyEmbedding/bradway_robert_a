mit on the segregation of maternal mrnas in early sea urchin embryos  he then returned to the uk as a postdoctoral fellow at imperial cancer research fund in london  by investigating the molecular changes on cell surfaces that distinguish cancer cells from normal cells he discovered fibronectin a cell adhesion protein present on normal cells but noticeably absent on cancer cells dr hynes returned to mit in  as an assistant professor and one of the founding members of the mit cancer center  there he continued to work out the biology of fibronectin showing that fibronectin affects cellular adhesion migration morphology and cytoskeleton and that fibronectin and actin fibrils coalign across the cell surface  these discoveries established the extracellular matrix ecm previously viewed largely as a structural entity as having a vital role in controlling cell adhesion morphology and migration  dr hynes also made major contributions to the discovery and first cloning of integrins a family of receptors that bind fibronectin and other cell adhesion molecules and form transmembrane links to the cytoskeleton  he and his colleagues also discovered the activation of fak through integrins thereby establishing integrins as true signaling receptors  the hynes laboratory cloned and analyzed many of the key molecules involved in cell adhesion eg fibronectin thrombospondin integrins talin plakoglobin and generated the first knockout mice lacking adhesion molecules fibronectin a integrin pselectin and subsequently many others eg other integrins and selectins cadherins and multiple ecm proteins and exploited them to dissect the roles of cell adhesion in normal development hemostasis thrombosis leukocyte traffic and inflammation angiogenesis and cancer  most recently the hynes laboratory has focused on metastasis particularly contributions of platelettumor cell interactions and ecm in promoting metastasis and has developed methods for systematic characterization and analysis of ecm changes in vivo  dr hynes work over the past  years has played a major role in establishing the molecular basis of cell adhesion and its many diverse and important effects on cells both in vitro and in vivo  this molecular understanding has formed the basis for development of antibodies and drugs that modulate cell adhesion and are in clinical use against thrombosis inflammation and autoimmune diseases and under investigation for efficacy against cancers  molecular understanding of cellecm interactions is also being exploited in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine dr

site for interdisciplinary research and drug discovery focused on the broad area of metabolism with translational foci in diabetes obesity and its cardiovascular complications  dr kellys research interests stem from an early fascination with rare inborn errors in mitochondrial metabolism in children which cause sudden death and heart failure  as a young researcher at washington university dr kelly defined the genetic basis for a common inborn error in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation work that led to the development of practical screening tests for newborns  thereafter he became interested in how similar derangements in cardiac energy metabolism contribute to heart failure and sudden death in common acquired forms of mitochondrial diseases caused by hypertension ischemic injury and diabetes  his work defined the transcriptional regulatory axis involved in the control of cardiac fuel and energy metabolism through pioneering fundamental work on nuclear receptors including the ppars estrogenrelated receptors errs and their transcriptional coactivator pgc  the kelly laboratory has identified molecular switches in this regulatory pathway that potentially define distinct forms of heart failure an important step towards identifying therapeutic targets for phenotypespecific treatment of heart failure  more recently the kelly laboratory has applied proteomic and

abnormalities of heart rhythm in patients at a molecular level they seek to understand how ion channel proteins perform their essential tasks in particular they are interested in a key paradox how these channels permit the flow of millions of ions a second yet do this with exquisite selectivity sodium channels allow sodium ions but not similarly sized and charged potassium ions altered regulation of sodium calcium and potassium channels by important cellular signaling systems which are involved in not only in how the heart conducts electricity but also the force with which it contracts and underlie important heritable and acquired diseases of the heart and skeletal muscle modeling diseases of ion channels channelopathies by using induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs and differentiating them in heart and skeletal muscle cells these cells are used to create cardiospheres that are used to print three dimensional tissues with a d bioprinter and reseed decellularized

and that was true broadly across our products as you can see from these results weve put the company in a strong position to manage competition for our legacy products while investing for growth with our newlylaunched and latestage pipeline products last year as you know we had six launches in the us we expect these products and especially kyprolis and repatha to pave the way for our long term growth well talk more about these launches and our priorities for them on this call if last year was a year of launches in the us this will be a year of launches for us internationally as we take repatha kyprolis and our other new products into countries around the world in total this year were expecting on the order of  new launches across our countries and products for example repatha is launching now in japan brazil and multiple countries in europe and the early signs are good similarly kyprolis is off to a strong early start in its first markets in europe our oncology and cardiovascular franchises received a lot of visibility last year owing to the flow of data and our product launches in these areas this year we expect attention to focus on our other franchises as well as our pipeline advances with important new opportunities in bone health for example our romosozumab opportunity is coming into focus with positive phase  data in nephrology we expect approval later this year for parsabiv a therapeutic for dialysis patients and we expect pivotal data in neuroscience for our migraine antibody amg  in inflammation we look forward later this year to establishing with the fda that our adalimumab molecule is indeed biosimilar to humira and while im speaking about our biosimilars programs id also remind you that we expect to submit our bevacizumab or avastin biosimilar file to regulators this year and to have phase  data for our trastuzumab or hercepton biosimilar as well our transformation efforts are well underway and delivering results this includes cost savings which david will discuss but also improved speed to market and speed in the market and these attributes are every bit as important as cost savings as we grow our company with new products in new territories and adapt to the changing environment for our industry finally weve designed our capital allocation strategy to deliver value for shareholders through both an attractive return of capital and dividends and buybacks and vigorous investment for longterm growth this is an exciting time in the field of biology with promising clinical opportunities and breakthroughs arising in many of our areas of interest so with a strong balance sheet and a longterm investment outlook we will continue to look for the most promising internal and external opportunities to advance to underscore our prior comments on this topic our emphasis will be on focus and capital discipline as we do this before turning to david let me just congratulate my colleagues around the world for the quality of their execution and a very strong start to the year david david w meline  chief financial officer  executive vice president okay thanks bob turning to the first quarter financial results on page six of the slide deck we are pleased with our strong performance driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio total revenues at  billion grew  year over year overall product sales increased  reflecting continued strong performance from our growth products which more than offset the impact of competition on our legacy products epogen and neupogen other revenues at  million increased  million versus the first quarter of  other revenue benefited both from an upfront partner payment for a licensing transaction representing almost  of total other revenue for the quarter as well as higher ibrance royalty income total revenue and product sales were impacted  unfavorably due to foreign exchange changes adjusted operating income at  billion grew  from prior year adjusted operating margin improved to  for the quarter reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories as in prior years our operating margin will likely be lower in the remaining quarters of the year driven by the timing of expenses in  we remain on track to deliver over  million of gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year this enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities while delivering solid profitability on an adjusted basis cost of sales as a percent of product sales at  improved by  points driven by manufacturing efficiencies higher net selling price and lower royalties research and development expenses at  million were relatively unchanged in the first quarter of  versus last year sga expenses increased  on a yearoveryear basis as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts in total adjusted operating expenses increased  year over year including a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately one percentage point other income and expenses were relatively flat on a yearoveryear basis at  million in the quarter as higher interest income was offset by higher interest expense the adjusted tax rate was  for the quarter a point increase versus q of  this increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and a state audit settlement in the same quarter of last year these increases were partially offset by the adoption of accounting standards update  a new accounting standard that impacts how certain sharebased compensation tax expense is recognized these impacts were previously reported on the balance sheet as a change in shareholders equity the new rule requires these impacts to be recognized in the income statement and thus have a tax rate impact future tax rate impacts will depend on the movement in our stock price between when we grant sharebased compensation and when it vests the q benefit of this change adds approximately  to our adjusted earnings per share adjusted net income increased  and adjusted earnings per share increased  year over year turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page seven free cash flow was  billion an increase of  million over last year we deployed  billion to repurchase  million shares in the quarter at an average price of  per share and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of  billion to  billion additionally our first quarter dividend increased to  per share an increase of  over last year at the end of the first quarter we had  billion remaining on our board authorized share buyback program and are on track to deliver on our capital allocation commitments to shareholders cash and investments totaled  billion an increase of  billion from last years first quarter level this increase reflects strong net cash flow and our first quarter debt issuance of  billion of which approximately  billion will be used to repay debt maturities over the balance of this year our debt balance stands at  billion as of march  of this year our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of  and an average maturity of  years turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of  on page eight we remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model today we are increasing our  guidance which reflects solid q performance from revenue and expense as well as a revised tax outlook with this background our  revenue guidance is now  billion to  billion versus prior guidance of  billion to  billion and our adjusted earnings per share guidance is now  to  a share versus prior guidance of  to  in addition we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be  to  including the impact of the previously mentioned accounting standards update versus prior guidance of  to  finally we expect to invest capital expenditures of approximately  million this year this concludes the financial update i will now turn the call over to tony anthony c hooper  executive vpglobal commercial operations thank you david and good afternoon folks youll find a summary of our sales performance for the first quarter on slide number  as bob said we had a great start with global product sales in the first quarter growing by  year over year our us business delivered  yearoveryear growth and sales growth in our international business was negatively impacted by five percentage points due to foreign exchange excluding the foreign exchange impact our international business was up  year over year i will structure my comments in three categories today performance in our growth products how we are managing the life cycle of our mature brands and conclude with an update on the performance of our newly launched products first our six growth products – prolia xgeva vectibix nplate sensipar and enbrel – aggregated nearly  billion in sales or over  of the first quarter sales growing  year over year sustaining their growth continues to be a priority for us let me start with prolia and xgeva which are now annualizing at approximately  billion per year prolia grew significantly at  year over year continued share gains drove growth in both the us and europe although with  yearoveryear unit demand growth in both regions we saw the typical seasonality in the first quarter in the us our directtoconsumer promotional efforts continued to drive increasing levels of new patient adoption and we are sustaining repeat injection rates of over  we expect continued growth from prolia to come for years xgeva grew  year over year unit share increased about three percentage points over last year in both the us and europe the first quarter was positively impacted by increased levels of purchasing by some large end customers in the us which we expect to burn off in the next quarter we continue to focus on xgevas superior clinical profile versus the competition and look forward to potential new indications which will drive sustained longterm growth turning to vectibix and nplate unit demand growth drove doubledigit gains year over year across both products for vectibix we continue to make solid inroads into earlier lines of therapy in both the us and europe sensipar grew  year over year driven by net selling price as well as unit growth in the us and europe with sales annualizing around  billion sensipar remains a growth driver we look forward to adding parsabiv as another treatment option for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism our regulatory filing for parsabiv are currently under review in both the us and europe let me now turn to enbrel enbrel grew  year on year due to changes on net selling price and inventory which was partially offset by competition as a reminder net selling price change comprises several components including list price increases as well as the rebates we provide to payers and the impact of formulary decisions in the first quarter of  inventory was at a normal level the yearoveryear inventory growth is as a result of prior year dynamics declines in inventory levels in the first quarter last year make for an approximately  million favorable comparison this quarter as we think about the second quarter this year we expect to see a reverse effect of a similar magnitude in other words the significant inventory build in the second quarter of  will create an unfavorable comparison assuming inventory levels remain normal next quarter turning to underlying performance for enbrel we saw  yearonyear growth in the rheumatology segment for the first quarter and enbrel held quarteroverquarter value share at  in dermatology competition from new entrants primarily nonbiologics helped drive yearonyear segment growth of  enbrels share in dermatology declined one percentage point quarter over quarter to  if youll recall rheumatology comprises about  of enbrel sales given enbrels exclusivity through  it remains a critical growth driver that we are continuing to invest behind let me now turn to how were managing the life cycle of our mature brands starting with our esa products aranesp sales increased  year over year driven by  unit growth in the us we are successfully transitioning our medium sized and independent provider centers from epogen to aranesp aranesp now represents over  of esas share of these providers international sales were negatively impacted by pricing pressures and foreign exchange rates epogen declined  year over year about a third of this decline is a shift from epogen to aranesp in the dialysis setting i mentioned above most of the decline comes from the shift from amgen esa to mircera at fresenius we understand that fresenius which represents about a third of the us dialysis business has converted over  of their patients to mircera if you remember we have a contract with davita which represents another third of the dialysis business to  to purchase at least  of the esas from amgen id also like to point out we also do not expect biosimilar competition to epogen in  neupogen declined  year over year and  quarter over quarter with a competitive landscape playing out as we generally expected neupogen exited the quarter with a  share of the shortacting set segment which now consists of zarxio granix and leukine as weve said before we continue to compete account by account as competition intensifies we continue to emphasize the value of neupogen all from its track record of safety efficacy and reliable supply neulasta grew  during the quarter unit growth of  included purchases by some large us end customers which we expect to burn off next quarter let me now turn to our launches beginning with the neulasta onpro kit the neulasta onpro kit has been an extremely successful launch achieving about onethird share of neulasta units in the first quarter and approaching  billion in cumulative sales in the  months since launch patients undergoing minor sequence chemotherapy regimens are at high risk of serious infections one of the biggest challenges physicians face in preventing these infections is patient compliance most insuring patients get the neulasta injection after each course of chemo and at the right time  hours after chemo these are critical steps in order to insure maximum benefit from neulasta with the neulasta onpro kit we are able to address this important unmet need this innovation also provides meaningful differentiation versus the traditional prefilled syringe and potential future competitors we also see the compliance rates improving with the use of neulasta onpro based on patient level data this is a great example of our strategy to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience by all measures this is a highly successful launch and the value it brings to patients and the healthcare system is translating to strong performance we remain focused on increasing adoption to benefit more patients kyprolis grew  year over year on a sequential basis us unit growth was offset by unfavorable changes to inventory and to net selling price the addition of endeavor data which demonstrated its superiority versus velcade to the us label in january further solidifies kyprolis profile as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy we expect sales to continue to grow as we treat more second line patients and they stay on therapy longer to achieve deeper and more durable responses in markets outside the us we are making good progress with our launches initial results have been very positive as we bring this important therapy to these patients blincyto continues to increase patient penetration in the us and launches are underway across europe as reimbursement is secured sean will discuss developments about the vectibix antibody platform in a moment imlygic our oncolytic immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma is currently indicated as monotherapy in the us and europe and is playing an important role in addressing the need for the small patient population we believe that true potential for imlygic lies in combination with other immunotherapies across different tumor types turning now to repatha which i continue to believe is one of our largest opportunities im pleased with our competitiveness to date our robust clinical development program clearly demonstrated repathas ability to deliver intensive and predictable ldlc reduction this message continues to resonate well with physicians and coupled with strong execution in the marketplace we continue to lead prescribing in the us as seen in the ims data in europe reimbursement negotiations are on track and were an early launch in several countries including germany spain the netherlands and scandinavia in japan we have now received pricing approval and launch activities with our partner sellers are well underway before handing over to sean i thought i would provide some color on the repatha launch in my personal experience ive seen a number of examples of successful but high value slower ramping products that share a few common traits with repatha first these products often contribute to changes in treatment paradigms such as new meclizine vaccine and new  in the case of repatha inhibition of pcsk is a novel mechanism and it is the first injectable biologic addressing chronic cardiovascular disease im excited about the prospect of launching the repatha monthly dosing option later this year reducing the number of required injections and creating another potential point of difference from the competition second these products often have significant development programs that improve the product profile expand their patient pools or extend duration of therapy over time with repatha how much we study with staffing and helping patients was well received by physicians at the recent american college of cardiology meeting our coronary imaging study well read out later this year and was designed to demonstrate that repatha reduces patients blood burden and most significantly of course we expect the read out of a large patient outcomes trial later this year which we expect will establish a clear benefit in cardiovascular outcomes based on repathas profound effect on lowering ldl cholesterol lastly access and reimbursement hurdles while intense should be overcome with a demonstration of superior clinical benefits versus the current standard of care we expect to establish this with repatha through the outcomes study i just mentioned you might have seen this dynamic successfully play out with the fact that tenase has displaced warfarin i am unwavering in my commitment and in the belief of repatha we will continue to work with payers to improve access to repatha for appropriate patients and expect its strong value proposition to benefit patients with ascvd who are at risk of heart attack or stroke in closing im pleased with our execution this quarter and our strong start to the year weve maintained focus on our growth brands while defending our mature portfolio and launching new products we recognize that our launch products are an important longterm value driver and are working relentlessly to make them a success let me close by recognizing that none of this would have been possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for the commitment to delivery to patients let me now pass it to sean sean e harper  executive vice presidentresearch  development thanks tony and good afternoon weve made a lot of exciting progress in q as we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative programs ill begin my remarks with our cardiovascular franchise starting with repatha statinassociated muscle symptoms represent a major unresolved challenge for treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and often result in the use of therapies that provide less ldl cholesterol reduction than desired in our recently completed phase  study gauss we evaluated repatha and ezetimibe in a group of patients whose statin intolerance was verified by rigorous blinded statin rechallenge where only those patients that experienced muscle related side effects on statin but not on placebo were studied as presented at the atc meeting and simultaneously published in the journal of american medical association the study demonstrated that repatha resulted in a significantly greater reduction in ldl cholesterol after  weeks as compared to ezetimibe with low levels of muscle related adverse events we believe this is an important result for those highrisk patients that are unable to effectively manage their ldl cholesterol due to muscle symptoms from statins looking ahead as tony mentioned we continue to look forward to the results of our coronary imaging study and cardiovascular outcome studies in the second half of this year we also continue to work closely with regulators on their reviews of our repatha monthly dosing option feedback from cardiologists on our innovative myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil has been consistent that we have a very compelling mechanism of action in phase  data set were currently working with our partners at cytokinetics and servier as well as global regulators to define a potential path to phase  outcomes studies turning to oncology our phase  open label study evaluating blincyto versus standard of care in patients with philadelphia chromosomenegative relapsed or refractory all was stopped at a prespecified interim analysis after successfully achieving the primary endpoint of improved overall survival this is a first for immunotherapy in this population and we look forward to discussions with regulators as we seek conversions to full approval in q we also filed an sbla for blincyto in the us to include new data supporting the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with all we feel blincyto could be an important treatment option for younger patients potentially avoiding the complications later in life such as secondary malignancies that can arise with the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies we are advancing our bispecific tcell engager or bite platform including amg  which continues to enroll patients in its phase  doseescalation study recall that amg  is our cd arm bite for acute myelitis leukemia or aml aml remains an area of profound unmet medical need despite adult aml being about four times as prevalent as adult all and with a very poor prognosis there have been no significant advances approved in the last  years staying with our immunooncology platforms we recently initiated enrollment in the phase  portion of our melanoma study of enlogic in combination with keytruda mercks pd inhibitor and we look forward to presenting the results from the phase b portion of this study at the upcoming asco meeting we also recently presented some encouraging firstinhuman data at the american association for cancer research annual meeting from one of our early stage immunooncology programs amg  this is our antibody against colonystimulating factor  receptor also known as cfams which stimulates the activation of tumorassociated macrophages theres great interest in the role that tumorassociated macrophages play in tumor immunosuppression and were helping to lead this field with amg  which is now enrolling patients in a phase  study in combination with keytruda in advanced solid tumors before i leave oncology i would note we continue to have productive interactions with regulators in europe on the kyprolis endeavor submission and im also pleased to announce that our phase  study of xgeva versus zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletalrelated events in patients with newlydiagnosed multiple myeloma has completed its enrollment this is an eventdriven study and based on the current event rate we estimate the data will be available in the second half of this year in bone health we were pleased to report along with our partners at ucb the positive results from two phase  romosozumab studies in q most importantly our placebocontrolled pivotal fracture study met both of its primary vertebral fracture endpoints as well as the important secondary endpoint of clinical fracture reduction this latter end point consists of symptomatic vertebral fractures plus nonvertebral fractures an endpoint increasingly recognized by physicians payers and regulators as these are the symptomatic fractures that can be lifealtering our phase  study of romosozumab in men with osteoporosis also successfully completed in q with romosozumab treatment resulting in significant gains in bone marrow density versus placebo we look forward to our prevla meeting with fda as we pull together our initial filing package in the us we also await the results from the eventdriven fracture study evaluating romosozumab in comparison to alendronate treatment which we expect to see in  and will be part of our european filing switching to neuroscience we had the opportunity to present the week data from our phase  episodic migraine study with our cgrp receptor antibody amg  at the american academy of neurology meeting earlier this month after one year of treatment with a milligram monthly dosing regimen more than  of patients experienced at least a  reduction in their monthly migraine days and about  of patients had no migraine days in month  these are patients that were having on the order of eight migraine days per month so this is quite a clinically meaningful result we believe the efficacy tolerability and administration profile of amg  could be an attractive option for migraine patients considering the lack of welltolerated prophylactic options currently available we are rapidly advancing this program through the clinic with our partners at novartis we now expect to have the results from our phase b chronic migraine study midyear and we intend to use this study to potentially gain an indication in chronic migraines in our initial bla filing weve also completed now enrollment in both of our phase  episodic migraine studies and expect the results from both of these in the second half of this year also in migraine we believe that amg  our pac receptor antibody could complement amg  and we continue to progress this asset through phase  in other regulatory activities we continue to work with global regulators on their review of parsabiv our novel intravenous calcimimetic for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on hemodialysis fda has also accepted our sbla for the expanded use of enbrel to treat pediatric patients with chronic severe plaque psoriasis finally with several pivotal data sets and regulatory decisions ahead of us we have a lot to look forward to this year and id like to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues at amgen for their unwavering focus on delivering innovative new medicines for patients in need bob robert a bradway  chairman president  chief executive officer okay thank you sean lets turn it over now to questions and arvind why dont you remind our callers of the procedure arvind k sood  vice presidentinvestor relations yes jade if you can go ahead and open it up for qa and just review the procedure for asking questions please questionandanswer session operator and your first question comes from the line of matthew harrison from morgan stanley matthew k harrison  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks for taking my question just a couple clarifications for tony you mentioned two end customer purchases for neulasta and xgeva can you tell how large they were and then second maybe if you could just expand around your comments for repatha i think its our understanding that  to  of scripts are abandoned at the pharmacy whats your view on what needs to change to lower that rate and how should we think about the change that outcomes data if positive could have there and is there a rate a hazard ratio for example in the outcomes data that you think would cause a significant shift in some of those utilization management criteria thanks anthony c hooper  executive vpglobal commercial operations okay so let me try and go through those so on the large customer end user purchases for xgeva and neulasta so in the range of  million to  million so not a large amount but they will clearly burn off during the second quarter when i look at repatha it is about a  rejection rate not abandonment thats happening at the pharmacy so a lot of the prescriptions being denied because they dont quite fit the prior auth process which has been required talking to cardiologists its clear that they are extremely frustrated at the moment because the patients theyre sending in are appropriate patients who are not being properly managed on their maximum tolerated statin at the moment we are spending quite a bit of time with payers at the moment and helping them see the – what i would imagine that the unintended consequences of a rather onerous paperbased prior auth system which is resulting in so many patients not getting access to drug when they should so i think with a bit more discussion people will understand the importance of getting appropriate patients on drug i think of some of the question in terms of narrowing the population is around what will the outcomes show and theres no doubt in my mind that once we have limited proof that this drug actually results not only in lowering ldl but in actually reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke that more patients will gain access to the drug arvind k sood  vice presidentinvestor relations jade lets go with the next question please operator and your next question comes from the line of geoff meacham of barclays geoff meacham  barclays capital inc good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question i just wanted to talk a little bit about romo just looking at the nonvertebral fracture data do you think that this could be a big variance competitively and then whats the outlook for the european filing based on the pmo data do you think that the – theres a risk that secondary end points that may have to be hit on that thank you robert a bradway  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks jeff sean why dont you take those questions sean e harper  executive vice presidentresearch  development in terms of the results the second part of the question relates i think to the ability to file the data set in europe and we do believe the data will support registration as is in europe but we also have always planned to file both outcomes – fracture studies so we have the alendronate controlled study in which the primary end point is clinical fracture that will be part of that – part of that file i think that when you step back there are a couple things one is that we need to present these data at the appropriate scientific congresses and publish them so that the experts in the field can look at the data because the paradigm for the study design is so different than what people are used to with a threeyear placebocontrolled portion rather than a oneyear placebocontrolled portion and in the end the most important endpoint to look at with these therapeutics weve hit which again is the symptomatic vertebral fractures plus nonvertebral and we had quite a significant effect size there as well as the transition from treatment with romosozumab on to prolia where we continue to see benefit of romosozumab into the second year on prolia so overall i think the data will be wellreceived when people are able to look at it in some detail operator and your next question comes from the line of terence flynn from goldman sachs terence flynn  goldman sachs  co hi thanks for taking the question maybe first just was wondering if you guys could comment on the treasury notice and intercompany debt and any potential impact to your longer term tax rate and then any potential for an fda panel on etelcalcetide thank you robert a bradway  chairman president  chief executive officer sure okay david why dont you take the first david w meline  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah so on the first one so first of all amgen of course is not a company thats inverted so were a usbased company and all of our debt is issued and received from third parties so we dont see any impact on our business in terms of our ability to finance and the ability to deduct the interest expense from our earnings so right now we dont see any impact but its a pretty detailed and lengthy ruling so we continue to look at it but we dont foresee any right now sean e harper  executive vice presidentresearch  development and terence its sean we dont anticipate the need for an fda advisory committee for parsabiv arvind k sood  vice presidentinvestor relations okay jade lets take the next question operator your next question comes from the line of alethia young from credit suisse alethia young  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hey guys thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to ask a little bit about kyprolis and if you were seeing any competition with darzalex or any of the other of the new regimens on the market if you could give me color there that would be great anthony c hooper  executive vpglobal commercial operations okay so let me answer that question this is tony clearly as i said the addition of the endeavor data to our label giving us both a doublet and a triplet regimen in second line both with clinical data showing great efficacy versus the prior regimens has put us in a good position to give patients in second line plus a better opportunity the data in the market is quite shallow because we havent looked at the patient chart orders but as i look at the orders for the first quarter i see kyprolis continue to hold market share in third line i see continued growth in the second line and i see the newer entrants with very slow single digit market shares and predominantly being used in fourth line plus operator and your next question comes from the line of cory kasimov from jpmorgan cory w kasimov  jpmorgan securities llc hey good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question so with regard to repatha access assuming you get positive cvot data later this year whats your understanding of the process youll need to follow in order to ease kind of current utilization management i guess im wondering how fast things could open up or if youre going to need to get the data and the label and renegotiate with payers first before youre able to tag a noticeable difference on that front thanks anthony c hooper  executive vpglobal commercial operations so as sean said were expecting the data in the latter end of this year once the data becomes clear itll become public and i think people will have to make up their minds what that actually means it will be presented then in a peerreviewed publication and presented at one of the large congresses where the data will become clear to all the prescribing cardiologists we of course from a commercial perspective are not in a position to negotiate or talk to payers about the data until the fda has approved it in our label in the interim however our medical affairs organization can respond to questions that we receive from the payers in a balanced and medical way but im assuming once this becomes clear the details will just clarify the unique value of this particular product sean sean e harper  executive vice presidentresearch  development this is sean i think the other comment i would make is that you may have seen that the – that some of the usbased guidelines for treatment of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular risks were recently updated and included the concept of using the pcsk inhibitors after stepping through some other therapeutic options that have the cardiovascular outcomes data its my understanding from talking with many of the key opinion leaders who are either involved in the guidelines or just thought leaders in the field theres – theres a clear desire to update these guidelines as fast as possible when the cardiovascular outcomes data are available so thats an independent process from anything to do with getting good data into the label and can be a very important thing that payers look at when they make access decision arvind k sood  vice presidentinvestor relations jade lets take the next question operator and your next question comes from the line of mark schoenebaum from evercore isi mark j schoenebaum  evercore isi hey guys maybe a question for bob in this environment biotech prices have obviously come down so im wondering what your current feelings bob are around hostile acquisitions thank you very much robert a bradway  chairman president  chief executive officer mark i dont know that id make any comments about hostile acquisitions but as youve heard us say before evaluations in some areas are more attractive this year than they were last and we have a strong balance sheet and we continue to look carefully both internally and externally for the most attractive programs that we can advance but we look at all range of transactions licensing as well as ma and we consider them each individually so i wouldnt speculate mark about anything more than that at this point operator and your next question comes from the line of michael yee from rbc capital markets michael yee  rbc capital markets llc great thanks a question for sean the pivotal cgrp data is certainly coming and theres a wealth of data coming youve talked in the past about your hypothesis about your mechanism and some differentiation can you maybe update us on your thoughts about how you still see that playing out as some more data has come out and just where data has played out can you maybe list one or two things where you specifically see some differentiation or how that plays in the future thanks sean robert a bradway  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you michael sean e harper  executive vice presidentresearch  development so michael i dont think much has really changed in terms of the fact that theres sort of fundamental scientific principles here around the difference between a receptor antagonist and the ligand weve always felt that the receptor antagonist would be more potent and were seeing that play out weve always thought that might result in a situation in which the administration profile of the product was better than it would be if larger amounts of protein were necessary for delivery for example on a monthly basis in a subcutaneous delivery device so i continue to think that its a relative advantage to have a more potent agent when youre trying to administer infrequent dosing subcutaneously but whether that will be really play into being an important clinical differentiator when these products are out in the marketplace is i think too soon to know otherwise we continue to push very hard on the product to get it to patients as fast as we can because there are about  million people with migraine in the united states and among them theres somewhere in the order of  million to  million who have had attempts or are currently on and off of therapy for prophylaxis so theres clearly a very large unmet medical need and some proportion of that population would be an appropriate population potentially for this sort of therapeutic operator and your next question comes from the line of josh schimmer from piper jaffray joshua e schimmer  piper jaffray  co broker okay thanks for taking the questions and maybe one for sean amgen has had such a strong track record advancing the phase  programs through to commercialization curious as to what there is in the phase  or earlier pipeline that youre most enthusiastic to move into phase  you mentioned omecamtiv curious as to what else sean e harper  executive vice presidentresearch  development sure i like to talk about that sort of thing the certainly omecamtiv is very exciting we also as i mentioned have another migraine prophylaxis antibody and of course the potential to actually develop a bispecific antibody that would address both of those pathways as a product behind that heart failure does remain a real focus for us and we actually are introducing a novel completely novel heart failure medicine into the clinic in a matter of days from now which is exciting and have quite a few early discoverylevel programs in that area cardiovascular more broadly we have some very interesting things were working on in the early and midstage pipeline and of course the bite platform has a very large number of products in preclinical phases that are moving toward the clinic and were seeing a situation in which were going to be introducing into the clinic multiple different therapies in some cases with different targets directed at the same hematological malignancy for example and are having to envision some interesting multiarmed clinical trials to try to get some efficiency in the testing when we have so many things coming forward simultaneously so theres a lot going on because of everything that happens thats happening at the commercialization interface we dont get a lot of time to talk about that and perhaps well have an opportunity in an upcoming business review setting to go through some of this in some more detail operator and your next question comes from the line of robyn karnauskas from citi robyn karnauskas  citigroup global markets inc broker hi thanks for taking my question so just thinking a little bit big picture on the repatha launch i think you called it like a slow launch and you were talking about working with payers how much are you willing to participate and deal with price versus say mortality outcomes so whats the balance of lowering price and mortality outcomes as far as opening up access thanks anthony c hooper  executive vpglobal commercial operations robyn its tony clearly as weve said we bring our products to market with a clear debate and discussion around the pharmoeconomic value of the products there was an extrapolated value that these drugs would actually result in reduction of both stroke heart attack and early untimely death and i think we will continue to bring the value to market there are rebates in the marketplace at the moment and that dynamic will continue over time as we jostle for formulary positions but i think what we bring to market at the moment is a pretty decent and acceptable value proposition to treat patients at high risk operator and your next question comes from the line of eun yang from jefferies eun k yang  jefferies llc thank you for taking the question a question on parsabiv with the bundled payment in dialysis what do you think could the pricing power be for the product like this particularly since parsabiv is expected to go generic in a couple of years thanks anthony c hooper  executive vpglobal commercial operations all right so its tony let me answer that one so as you know cms have gone with a twoyear period that this product will operate outside of the bundle under the asp pricing method which will give cms two years to evaluate the product value and then to make a decision how much value is put into the bundle when the product moves from asp into the bundle operator and your next question comes from the line of ying huang from bofa merrill lynch ying huang  bank of america merrill lynch hi thanks for taking my question the first one for maybe sean to talk about a few outcome trials here i know you guys never disclose the powering assumption or the assumption for event rate but should we assume that its probably similar to what your competitor has talked about and then secondly i have a question on the epo market so fresenius is switching to mircera from roche you have a longterm contract with davita what is your thought of the other onethird of the market with epo and also  going forward robert a bradway  chairman president  chief executive officer well take this in two parts sean will take your first question and then tony can address your epo question sean e harper  executive vice presidentresearch  development actually both we and regeneron and sanofi have published papers on the design of these studies where theres a quite a bit of detail in the way that they were constructed and in the end these types of studies differ largely on the issue of how long it takes to enroll the population and what the event rate is once you get patients enrolled there are not we dont believe – we would not anticipate large differences in the event rates between the two populations but there will be some difference in event rate and i think both companies have set their studies up so that they would be able to detect what was considered to be a clinically meaningful minimum effect size so typically one would set these kind of trials up so that you wouldnt miss a  reduction in risk obviously you may be looking for more but that would be the way you power the trial so there are more similarities than there are differences anthony c hooper  executive vpglobal commercial operations okay so let me answer your question on the dialysis market youre right the market is broken into three davita is responsible for about onethird of the market we have a contract with them that is exclusive that runs to  fresenius who is responsible for another onethird of the market are in the process of converting a lot of their patients the last time they made any numbers public they were talking about just over  conversion to mircera the other onethird of the market is the independent medium and small dialysis units in that setting we have converted about  of the epogen usage to aranesp operator and your next question comes from the line of geoff porges from leerink partners geoffrey c porges  leerink partners llc thank you i appreciate the question tony a couple for you could you talk a little bit about price on enbrel the contribution of price should we just infer that its the difference between the growth the units and the inventory it looks about  and could you just talk about whether that looks to be sustainable given the market environment and then on a related note could you talk about the value proposition for amg  certainly millions of patients out there with migraine but you can imagine payers preparing to do some of the things that they did for repatha so how do you think that youre going to approach the value proposition of that indication to avoid the sort of really tight restrictions that youve encountered anthony c hooper  executive vpglobal commercial operations okay so lets go back to the front end just to reconfirm again what we report and what we talk about in terms of net price and really thats a combination of the list price minus the rebates andor formulary positions you have in the marketplace i think as a company were acutely aware of the issues facing the industry in the us at the moment but amgens all about innovation right so we price our drugs around the pharmacoeconomic value of the products as we bring them to market enbrel itself of course is competing in a highly competitive marketplace where several large players are competing for formulary position to enable patient access at the same time the health plans and the pbns are negotiating price concessions on large rebates to set up formulary placements themselves and its because of the magnitude of these rebates that price increases have become part of this overall dynamic so its an integrative process flow as we go forward talking about  as sean has said again and again this is a huge unmet medical need in the marketplace where existing therapies have side effects that are sometimes as bad as the disease itself unlike most other diseases patients with chronic migraine really know about it its debilitating its devastating and some of the initial research weve done have shown a much higher inclination or preparedness to pay a copay because patients really want to get rid of the disease as quick as they can i think most of the patients who are available to us have been on therapy for some time and were able to show theyve been on therapy so step edits im sure will be there but theres a large bolus of patients who have failed consistently on existing treatment in the marketplace arvind k sood  vice presidentinvestor relations so jade im noticing that its fast approaching  on the east coast why dont we take two last questions operator and your next question comes from the line of jim birchenough from wells fargo securities yanan zhu  wells fargo securities llc hi thanks for squeezing us in this is actually yanan zhu in for jim i wanted to ask a question on the cgrp program specifically on the regulatory path as you know its a competitive space with four players you have the clear lead the first phase  data readout for that frequent episodic migraine indication however in a chronic migraine indication its a little less clear because others have phase  programs ongoing interestingly you just mentioned you commented that you might use the phase  data that is going to read out – the phase b data in chronic migraine – to support a bla our question is do you think you will seek a chronic migraine indication based on the phase b data have there been any discussion with regulators on that thanks sean e harper  executive vice presidentresearch  development this is sean i think that the things have you to take into account is that the chronic migraine phase b study is quite a large study and it explores doses that are used in the two large phase  episodic migraine studies and these are obviously – theres a spectrum of disease here – and while there is a separate regulatory entity of chronic migraine and episodic migraine the path of physiology is probably quite shared across these as evidenced by the fact that all the cgrp antagonists are having similar efficacy in the different patient populations so its our feeling that taken together the aggregate data could potentially support both indications being granted at least by some of the global regulators and i would not typically go into the discussions about the specific conversations weve had with regulators but id just say that we feel that its a very reasonable approach to attempt to get both indications based on the aggregate data package arvind k sood  vice presidentinvestor relations great lets take one last question operator and your final question comes from the line of jeff chen from cowen  company jeff chen  cowen  co llc hi thanks for taking my question for tony could you just discuss a little bit more about repatha in eu and japan in terms of your experience of access and reimbursement and if you think that the cvot outcomes data will change the negotiation or would that be a new round of negotiations thanks anthony c hooper  executive vpglobal commercial operations so i think if youve heard people talk about the  performance in europe where once the price has been set and reimbursement is agreed theres no longer an economic decision around every prescription so uptake happens quite fast so i believe that as we get into growing into this marketplace pricing is just about set when you come in with larger expanded patient population groups theres a chance in europe you have to go back in it in a countrybycountry negotiation in japan historically that hasnt happened as much and the pricing we receive in japan seems to be a longer playthrough from pricing arvind k sood  vice presidentinvestor relations great thank you everybody for your participation on this busy busy day of course ill be around together with the rest of my team so if we can offer any further assistance please give me a call have a good day operator ladies and gentlemen this
