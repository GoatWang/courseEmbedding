email address got it got it by neil irwin by neil irwin may   follow neilirwin most people enjoyed the office most for the antics of boss michael scott or the touching relationship between paper salesman jim halpert and erstwhile receptionist pam beesly i liked the show which aired its finale after nine seasons thursday night best when it gave us a window into the business practices of this particular office in short dunder mifflin was a disaster as a business and that was the reality that haunted the show — the underlying truth that created a lot of the tension always lurking for the characters the show never would have worked if it had been set in a fastrising internet startup or even a stable industry theres too much overhead in this office tyler goldennbc there are many ways in which the dunder mifflin business model made no sense whatsoever it is a retailer of office paper which is the ultimate commodity something that companies want to buy at the lowest possible cost yet dunder mifflin pairs this lowmargin commodity product with an expansive sales force the scranton office alone had four or five salespeople at any given time calling on clients and working new leads the entire business seems premised on the idea that a personal touch and better service will be enough to make up for prices that are higher than at staples or office depot its more likely that the office managers in charge of paper procurement at scranton area businesses would be more annoyed by the constant harassment from their paper salesman than pleased by the enhanced service if you’re selling a complex product essential to certain business operations like software or key manufacturing equipment it makes plenty of sense to have a large talented staff of salespeople and customer relations experts but this is just  paper dunder mifflin sells a commodity but its staffed like it sells something unique then theres the overhead if dunder mifflin somehow found a way to make the paper  work as a hightouch salesintensive business it would still need to keep expenses as low as possible but this company has a tremendous burden of whitecollar staff who draw salaries but do not directly drive sales it obviously has to employ a branch manager — michael scott and later andy bernard  because somebody has to be in charge of the sales force but almost every other position at the scranton branch is hard to justify there are three people in the accounting department angela kevin and oscar but bookkeeping should instead be centralized across all dunder mifflin’s branches why does an office of maybe  people need its own human resources person the answer of course is that the managers have been walking human resources disasters but that’s a reason to get new managers not to employ toby flenderson as a fulltime hr guy kelly kapoor technically was in charge of “customer service” all those years but shouldn’t that be the salespeoples’ jobs what in the world do creed in charge of quality control and meredith supplier relations do all day darryl philbin was promoted from running the warehouse to a whitecollar management job in season six but it was never clear why they needed yet another manager in this small office pam managed to give herself the title “office administrator” in the seventh season despite all those other people already in place to administer the office and somehow this is the only office in america where callers still have to go through a fulltime receptionist to reach someone rather than call the person directly that’s not even the end of it in the early seasons of the show this regional paper company that sells a lowmargin commodity good in markets like scranton utica and buffalo located its headquarters not in some anonymous office park in one of those cities but in    midtown manhattan home of some of the highest rents on earth add to all that dunder mifflin of course is in a declining industry as michael scott’s memorable slogan put it “limitless paper in a paperless world” it would be one thing if all this staffing were designed to accommodate future growth but there is no reason to think that theres any growth to comedavid wallace the chief financial officer of this monstrosity of a company came across as one of the few competent leaders at dunder mifflin but he runs an operation with staffing and overhead horribly illsuited to its business model that is the greatest mystery of dunder mifflin at a time when its business model would have in reality been collapsing upon itself the company had remarkable stability most of the workers who appeared in the premier episode nine years ago were still there trudging along this week ensuring that the people of scranton could get their precious paper in a modern workplace of constant churn that may be the most unrealistic aspect of the whole show but it is also what made this fictional company in a drab town in a boring business the stuff of
