at this time i would like to turn the call over to cliff pemble clifton a pemble  garmin ltd thanks teri and good morning everyone as announced earlier today garmin recorded first quarter consolidated revenue of  million up  over the prior year marine outdoor aviation and fitness collectively increased  yearoveryear and contributed  of total revenues gross margin improved to  as both segment and product mix were favorable as a result of our increased revenues and gross margins our operating margin improved to  while operating income increased  this resulted in gaap eps of  which includes a significant income tax benefit recognized during the quarter pro forma eps which excludes this benefit grew  to  in the quarter we are pleased with our first quarter results which delivered growth in revenue profits and earnings however since q represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year we are maintaining the guidance issued in february doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes but first id like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of each business segment starting with marine revenue grew  ahead of the overall market resulting in market share gains all major product categories performed well gross margin improved to  while operating margin improved to  resulting in operating income growth of  over the prior year marine season is in full swing and we have seen strong demand for our latest product offerings we started shipping our new gpsmap chartplotters early in the season and the feedback from customers has been very positive looking forward we remain focused on gaining market share through innovations that will clearly differentiate us in the market looking next at outdoor revenue increased  on strong demand for outdoor wearables the segment continue to generate strong gross margin and operating margin of  and  respectively while operating income grew  over the prior year we began shipping the highly anticipated fēnix  adventure watch series late in the quarter orders have been very strong and we expect that it will take several weeks to catch up with demand we also recently hosted our first connect iq developer summit bringing together application developers and business partners to participate in handson workshops and breakout sessions with our product managers and engineers at the event we announced new capabilities for connect iq including the ability for app developers to implement a revenue model we also announced new integration partners including smartthings which gives us a strong presence in the emerging home automation market turning next to aviation we reported solid revenue growth of  driven by growth in aftermarket products and led by strong growth related to our adsb offerings gross and operating margins remained strong at  and  respectively resulting in operating income growth of  over the prior year during the quarter we started shipments of the g nxi the next generation integrated flight deck featuring wireless connectivity and enhanced safety features we received european certification for the gtx  expanding the addressable market for this popular adsb transponder in addition we continue to support our oem partners in the development and certification of new aircraft and helicopter platforms much has been said about the challenging market conditions which remain a factor however we continue to believe that market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for longterm growth looking next at fitness revenue declined  driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers especially those which lack gps capability despite this challenge we are very pleased with the performance of advanced wearables with gps capability which experience robust growth during the quarter and nearly offset the steep decline of basic activity trackers gross margin increased to  as product mix shifted to the highermargin devices operating margin increased to  resulting in operating income growth of  during the quarter we launched the forerunner  which is our most advanced multisport watch with new running dynamics features and enhanced performance and recovery monitoring we also introduced our latest vívosmart  an ultraslim smart activity tracker with wrist based heart rate and an innovative stress tracking feature while we continue to see the market for basic activity trackers mature we also see growth opportunities in advanced wearables with gps and we are confident in our product roadmap going forward looking finally at the auto segment revenues were down  in the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the pnd market and partially offset by growth in our auto oem product lines gross margin was  which is consistent yearoveryear while operating margin declined to  during the quarter we began shipping our next generation drive family of pnd devices which has wireless connectivity and enhanced driver alerts we also introduced the dash cam  and  offering highquality recording in an ultracompact form factor we remain focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment okay finally before turning the call over to doug i wanted to mention the recognition we recently received from forbes magazine ranking us among the top  most reputable companies in america im pleased to work very hard to make garmin the best at everything we do and to operate the business with integrity its a special honor for all of us to be recognized in this way so that concludes my remarks next doug will walk you through additional details of our financial results douglas g boessen  garmin ltd thanks cliff good morning everyone ill begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results to move the comments on the balance sheet cash flow statement and taxes we posted revenue of  million for the first quarter representing a  increase yearoveryear gross margin was  a basis point increase from the prior year created by the shift towards segments with higher margin as well as product mix within certain segments operating expense as a percentage of sales is   basis points increase from the prior year operating income was  million a  increase yearoveryear operating margin was   basis points increase from the prior year and the increase in gross margin was an offset to increase in operating expenses our gaap eps was  to include a  million income tax benefit due to reevaluation of certain switzerland deferred tax assets our pro forma eps was  a  increase from the prior year next well look at our first quarter revenue by segment in the first quarter we achieved  consolidated growth led by doubledigit growth in three of our five segments collectively marine outdoor aviation and fitness were up  compared to the prioryear quarter looking next the first quarter revenue charts collectively the marine outdoor aviation and fitness segments contributed  total revenue in the first quarter  compared to  the prior quarter marine grew from  to  while aviation grew from  to  and outdoor grew from  to  you can see in the charts where we illustrate profit mix by segment marine outdoor aviation fitness segments collectively delivered  of operating income in the first quarter of  compared to  first quarter of  marine outdoor aviation fitness segments had a yearoveryear increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin looking next to the operating expenses first quarter operating expenses increased by  million or  research and development increased  million yearoveryear or  basis points to  of sales we continued to invest in innovation increasing resources focused primarily on aviation fitness outdoor marine where we see longterm growth opportunities sga was up  million compared to prior quarter and increased  basis points as a percent of sales to  increased spending in sga was primarily driven by increased legalrelated expenses and information technology costs advertising expense was relatively flat compared to prioryear quarter representing  of sales a few highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement we ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately  billion accounts receivable had decreased as expected sequentially and yearoveryear  million our inventory balance increased over the prior year sequentially to  million as we prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter in the first quarter of  we generated free cash flow of  million a  million decrease from the prior year quarter also during quarter we paid dividends of  million we purchased  million of company stock with  million remaining for purchase through december  in the first quarter of  we reported income tax benefit of  million which includes a  million sic  million  income tax benefit due to revaluation of certain switzerland deferred tax assets excluding the  million sic  million  income tax benefit the first quarter  pro forma effective tax rate was  compared to  the prior quarter sic prior year quarter  the  basis point yearoveryear increase in the pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the companys election to align certain switzerland tax positions with international tax initiatives we continue to expect our full year  pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately  this concludes our formal remarks christy could you please open the line for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question is from the line of charlie anderson of dougherty  company your line is open charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc for taking my questions cliff i noticed in outdoor marine and aviation youre sort of well ahead of where you laid out the segment guidance for the year so i wonder if you could kind of talk about how that flows the rest of the year considering we started that these kind of high levels to begin the year and then i have a follow up clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah i think for outdoor and marine the first quarter tends to be the lowest quarter particularly in outdoor and marine its a little higher aviation is more sequential in aviation we did see some benefit from increased mandate activity some of which are expiring so just looking forward we felt like its best to maintain where were at until we have more clarity around second quarter charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc okay then on fēnix  i know its very early right now but i know part of the rationale for that product was to expand the market beyond the current users i wonder if you have any data back yet on whos buying are they existing garmin owners or are they new people are the demographics changing any color on that would be helpful thanks clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah definitely the demographics are changing particularly around the fēnix s model which was designed specifically around the female adventure audience and the data were getting back through our online registrations and of course our cloud platform garmin connect suggests that were being very successful with that charlie lowell anderson  dougherty  co llc great thanks so much clifton a pemble  garmin ltd thanks charlie operator thank you our next question is from the line of simona jankowski of goldman sachs your line is open simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co hi thank you very much can you give us a sense for the split within the fitness segment between the basic activity trackers and the advanced wearables clifton a pemble  garmin ltd its about even simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co its about even okay and then your inventory days are really high  which i think may be an alltime record and i did hear your comments about preparing for the seasonally strong second quarter but it still seems like a high level of inventory so is that because youre seeing stronger than usual demand in the june quarter or is there something in there that like activity trackers that is maybe the result of some of those categories coming a bit short of expectations clifton a pemble  garmin ltd no i wouldnt say its due to shortness at all we are preparing for what has become – q has become nearly as big as q in terms of its overall contribution and we do have some new product ramps such as the fēnix  which are driving additional inventory i think our goal is to have instock situation so that we can ship to any customer that wants our products during high season and well continue to manage it pragmatically then throughout the rest of the year simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co thank you very much clifton a pemble  garmin ltd thanks simona operator thank you our next question is from tavis mccourt of raymond james your line is open tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc hey guys thanks for taking my questions just a clarification cliff on the roughly  split in fitness between basic and gpsenabled given the asp differences is that a unit split or a revenue split clifton a pemble  garmin ltd i think its a revenue split tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc okay and then a couple of other followups on cost structure so obviously weve seen a big increase in memory prices the last six months or so how has that impacted you guys in the first half of this year or is there an impact that we should expect in the second half of the year related to that and then it looks like advertising expense was down yearoveryear for the first time in a while is that something you would expect to continue or was that timing related clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah so on the memory prices definitely theres a tighter market and prices have been going up we have some longer term buying arrangements that have allowed us to continue at more favorable pricing during the first part of the year we do expect to see some impact towards the later half of the year but we think the impact will be minimal in terms of ad spending q we basically have reserved a lot of our activity until q so i would expect that to increase sequentially and possibly a little yearoveryear as well but since q is one of the higher quarters were going to be promoting our more popular wearables particularly during the quarter tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc great and i just wanted to make sure i understood correctly your commentary around aviation given the strong q was it stronger than you had expected entering the quarter or did you expect a lot of the aftermarket strength and that will ebb and flow throughout the year clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah we were pleased we outperformed our expectations for sure and as i mentioned there is some mandates particularly around ems helicopters that drove some sales plus we did have very popular aftermarket products that also performed well along with adsb tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc great thanks very much clifton a pemble  garmin ltd thanks so much operator thank you our next question is from joe wittine of longbow your line is open joe h wittine  longbow research llc hi thanks in fitness for the half of the segment thats nongps cliff are you able to give some sense of the magnitude of the declines youre seeing in that market for simple devices clifton a pemble  garmin ltd well just to clarify fitness consists of both the wearable fitness trackers as well as the running watches and then bike but in terms of overall its contribution we saw sharply lower revenues in the quarter and offset by very strong growth in the running products joe h wittine  longbow research llc are you able to provide any sort of idea of just the severity of those declines just to help us level set our models  clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah i think – we dont break it out by segment for sure but as we expected when we came into q based on what we saw in the latter half of  activity trackers were down sharply i think theres probably lots of different reasons for that and i think therell be obviously more color around that even as we move through the day but it seems like theres a lot of inventory in the channel particularly with market leaders thats being worked through and as that clears and as new products get in such as our vívosmart  we believe that it will moderate as the year goes forward joe h wittine  longbow research llc with that dichotomy between the lowend and the highend are you making any strategic changes to your development resources for the segment either pulling back on the low end or reassigning to higherend devices or is the strategy to remain every bit as committed to continuing to add features to the below gps product set clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah we have a strong roadmap on the basic trackers as weve evidenced by the release of our initial products this year we have additional products coming but obviously were taking a pragmatic approach to the investment and applying it where we see the most opportunity joe h wittine  longbow research llc okay and then finally for me fēnix  the availability remains pretty spotty including through april a bunch of big retailers still dont have it i dont think youre selling it on garmincom just yet so you referenced orders are strong i just wanted to confirm theres no supplyside issues to be aware of and i suppose its more difficult to manage them prior launches given the higher number of individual skus than previously thanks clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah i think definitely were pleased with the initial response and its not just a matter of low supply weve been delivering in very nice quantities for sure but the orders and the reorders have been very strong so its going to take some time to work through all of the orders that we have joe h wittine  longbow research llc okay thats helpful thanks a lot clifton a pemble  garmin ltd thanks joe operator thank you our next question is from paul coster of jpmorgan your line is open paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc yeah thanks for taking my question as the mix shift goes towards more ramps devices in the fitness category what should the impact on gross margins and operating margins in that segment be please clifton a pemble  garmin ltd well itll definitely mix up because the higherend devices tend to have the higher gross margin so we would expect it will have an overall positive impact on gross margin percentage and operating margin percentage paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc okay and my second question is you appear to be gaining market share again in marine and possibly in aviation can you just talk us through whats giving rise to that how thats coming about and can it be sustained clifton a pemble  garmin ltd well i think our product lines particularly in marine and also i mentioned some strength in aviation too but our product lines are very strong weve been keeping them fresh and as a result we believe that customers are seeing the value and the differentiation that garmin brings to the market keep in mind these are both very niche segments without a lot of dynamics in terms of the overall channel and the consumer so consequently i think obviously theres some limit to what the potential growth trajectory looks like over the long term but our goal is to be the market share leader and to continue to be able to grow with the market paul coster  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah thanks paul operator thank you our next question is from yuuji anderson of morgan stanley your line is open yuuji anderson  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks for taking my question a question on gross margins just overall you saw a good improvement yearoveryear in q but just kind of assuming things kind of trend back towards your  guidance for the year are there certain segments that are going to see more volatility than others just any color will be helpful there clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah i think a lot of its going to depend again on product and segment mix in q we had the benefit of higher than expected growth in marine and aviation which mixed to be overall consolidated up more as we move into q which is seasonally higher and sequentially higher well see how that mix develops both in terms of segments and products yuuji anderson  morgan stanley  co llc got it and then just a question on fitness is it fair to say that – did you see a pause in shipments ahead of the new product launches in q so are you expecting to kind of make back a lot of that in q clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah so we really didnt preannounce any of the products in q we were basically ready to ship when we announce the products so we didnt see any market impact from announcements that impacted order that said with the new products weve seen excitement around those and were encouraged by the followthrough in the market on these new products yuuji anderson  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks so much clifton a pemble  garmin ltd thanks yuuji operator thank you our next question is from ben bollin of cleveland research your line is open ben j bollin  cleveland research co llc good morning everyone thanks for taking my question clifton a pemble  garmin ltd good morning ben j bollin  cleveland research co llc i wanted to start on the aviation business could you talk a little bit about what youre seeing in the oem category on the business jet side any expectations you have for how that develops through the year if visibility does improve and kind of your market share impressions and then i have a followup clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah so on the oem side of aviation i would say its business as usual from what weve been reporting for a while now the overall oem side of the business as has been widely reported by many players has been kind of lethargic in terms of the market were doing i would say okay but we kind of move along with the ups and downs of our oem partners we do have the benefit of some newer platforms that were still comping against from last year so thats an incremental benefit but in general oem continues to be somewhat sluggish ben j bollin  cleveland research co llc and a broader question when you look at kind of the wearables category as a whole how do you view the impact of what apple has done with watch last night they said the units for their apple watch grew nearly  yearonyear im curious if you think its having any impact on your outdoor and fitness business and then a last housekeeping item maybe for doug could he talk about the fx impact to operating profit in the quarter before including the fx hedges thank you clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah ben in terms of impact from the apple watch we are also seeing steep growth in our advanced wearable category it doesnt seem to us that there is an impact from the apple watch we have said before that we believe the customerbase for the apple watch versus our devices are slightly different so consequently i think were seeing a strong performance and even some pull through from their success as people see the opportunity for improved health and for pursuing active lifestyles and they probably recognize then that garmin offers strong products for those pursuits douglas g boessen  garmin ltd yeah and regarding the fx impact in q there was a revenue headwind about  million so not a significant amount of impact in the quarter ben j bollin  cleveland research co llc thank you clifton a pemble  garmin ltd thank you operator thank you our next question is from brad erickson of pacific crest securities your line is open brad d erickson  pacific crest securities hi guys thanks for taking the question first can you just lay out how much q outdoor benefited from the fēnix  channel fill or i guess how much it added to the overall outdoor growth rate in the quarter clifton a pemble  garmin ltd we dont break it out by product categories but we were pleased with what were able to deliver in q brad d erickson  pacific crest securities got it and then i guess a higher level question on fitness given the maturity in basic trackers youre calling out is that a business garmin really wants to be in longer term weve always known that pricing and margins would inevitably sort of compress in that segment but with calling out maturity it seems like its a headwind worth addressing now from a strategic standpoint any comment there clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yeah lets say its still a very large market its still a market that is adjacent to our interest in the overall active lifestyles and so its an area that we still have a lot of interest in brad d erickson  pacific crest securities got it thanks clifton a pemble  garmin ltd thanks brad operator thank you our next question is from rich valera of needham  company your line is open rich f valera  needham  co llc thank you cliff i just wanted to try to clarify your comments about the basic trackers being – i think you said  of the wearables in fitness but that would exclude the cycling products is that correct clifton a pemble  garmin ltd thats correct rich f valera  needham  co llc and so its less than  of the total fitness category revenue right clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yes rich f valera  needham  co llc and would you be willing to give any sense of how big the cycling piece is clifton a pemble  garmin ltd no sorry we dont break it down more than that rich f valera  needham  co llc fair enough and just on the marine category obviously you saw a very strong growth there and i would guess you got some yearoveryear benefit from the partial quarter contribution of the delorme in the first quarter of  would you be willing to give any sense of how much of yearoveryear benefit you might have gotten from that sort of partial quarter delorme impact in the first quarter of  clifton a pemble  garmin ltd yes so delorme is actually recognized in the outdoor segment and the majority of our growth in outdoor was driven by wearables with less than half of that really coming from delorme rich f valera  needham  co llc got it okay thank you clifton a pemble  garmin ltd all right thank you operator thank you and that concludes our qa session for today id like to turn the call back over to teri seck for any
