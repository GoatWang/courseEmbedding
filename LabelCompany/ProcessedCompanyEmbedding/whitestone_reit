acquisition strategy to fuel future growth growth prospects acquisitions are a key piece of whitestones growth strategy the company abides by several acquisition criteria before purchasing a property first it seeks to find visible properties in wellestablished highincome areas the properties are typically  square feet and the properties must have potential for increasing rents and renovation potential and may also feature vacant land to build on it also will invest in distressed properties whose maturity has passed with a high likelihood that it will not be refinanced purchasing nonperforming assets allows whitestone to buy valuable properties on the cheap which it can redevelop and earn a sizable rate of return it completed two major acquisitions to start  blvd place and

whitestone expects ffopershare in a range of  per share for  which would represent a return to growth on a pershare basis dividend analysis whitestone has obvious appeal for income investors because of its very high dividend yield that said it is also important to assess a reits ability to pay its dividend especially with such highyielding stocks like whitestone for the first quarter of  whitestone had a debttoebitda ratio of  which is high the good news is management intends to reduce the ratio to  over the next one to two years the bad news is this is still a fairly high debt level

core ffo of  per share fully covers its annualized dividend of  per share if the company can continue growing ffo moving forward it will strengthen its dividend coverage another piece of good news is that approximately  of whitestones debt is fixedrate with a manageable weighted average interest rate of  this will help blunt the impact of rising interest rates moving forward its mortgage debt averages just  million in maturities over the next three years it has ample shortterm liquidity with over  million in an unused credit revolver along with  million in cash however the longerterm picture is much cloudier whitestone is facing approximately  million in total maturities in  if the company can grow ffopershare it could withstand its longterm maturities still investors should keep an eye on whitestones financial results in subsequent quarters to confirm its debt reduction strategy is still intact final thoughts the old saying high risk high reward seems to apply to whitestone while the stock has a tantalizingly high dividend yield it is not without risk the current dividend payout looks sustainable for now and over the next few years whether the dividend can be maintained
