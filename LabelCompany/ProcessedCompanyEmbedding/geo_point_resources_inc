technologies inc a utah corporation geo point utah approved a stock dividend that resulted in a spinoff spinoff of geo point resources inc the company common stock to the geo point utah stockholders pro rata on the record date the record date prior to the spinoff the company was a whollyowned subsidiary of geo point utah the company was incorporated on june   comprising all of geo point utahs environmental and engineering divisions assets business operations rights or otherwise along with its hydrocarbon identification technology license agreement with william c lachmar dated january    the spinoff had a record date of january   an exdividend date of january   and a spinoff payment date of april   note   summary of significant accounting policies going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern as reflected in the financial statements the company has incurred significant current period losses negative cash flows from operating activities has negative working capital an accumulated deficit and a revolving line of credit from a third party in order to fund its operations these conditions among others raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern managements plans regarding these matters if needed include raising additional debt or equity financing the terms of which might not be acceptable to the company the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty interim financial statements the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared by the company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission the sec  the accompanying balance sheet as of december   and the statements of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended december   and  are unaudited the unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and in the opinion of management reflect all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows for such periods  the financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the financial statements related to the three and nine month periods are unaudited  the results of the nine months ended december   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending march   any other interim period or any other future year use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements  actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates made by management include allowance for doubtful accounts and the useful life of property and equipment fair value of financial instruments the company complies with the accounting guidance under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements as well as certain related fasb staff positions  this guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact business and considers assumptions that marketplace participants would use when pricing the asset or liability such as inherent risk transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance f the guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for measurements of fair value as follows  level   quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level   inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities    level   unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities   as of december   and march   the company did not have level   or  financial assets or liabilities financial instruments consist of cash accounts receivable payables and a line of credit  the fair value of financial instruments approximated their carrying values as of december   and march   due to the shortterm nature of these items concentration of credit risks and customer concentrations during the nine months ended december   services provided to two customers accounted for  related party and  of total revenues  during the nine months ended december   services provided to two customers accounted for  and  of total revenues  one of these customers is considered a related party see note  management believes the loss of these customers would have a material impact on the company revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized and earned  the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when  it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  services have been rendered and are invoiced  the price is fixed or determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured the companys primary source of revenue has been in its environmental division providing historical site data searches preliminary investigation and drilling site characterization modeling regulatory agency liaison and full environmental cleanups using such methods as vapor extraction air sparging bioremediation orc oxygen release compound and hrc hydrogen release compound injection treatment air stripping and ionic exchange  revenues from providing historical site data searches preliminary investigation and drilling site characterization modeling regulatory agency liaison and full environmental cleanups using such methods as vapor extraction air sparging bioremediation orc oxygen release compound and hrc hydrogen release compound injection treatment air stripping and ionic exchange are recognized after services have been performed  the company also has operations associated with the oil and gas segment that have limited activity and have not yet generated revenues  all revenues are reported inclusive of shipping and handling costs billed and exclusive of any taxes billed to customers if any  shipping and handling costs incurred if any are reported in cost of products sold see note  for revenue transactions with a related party basic and diluted income loss per common share basic income loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period  diluted income loss per common share reflects the potential dilution to basic earnings per share that could occur upon conversion or exercise of securities options or other such items to common shares using the treasury stock method based upon the weighted average fair value of the companys common shares during the period as of december   and  the company did not have any dilutive securities f note   financial statement elements loans receivable  construction project in july

special note regarding forwardlooking statements this quarterly report includes forwardlooking statements based on managements beliefs assumptions and plans for the future information currently available to management and other statements that are not historical in nature  forwardlooking statements include statements in which words such as expect anticipate intend plan believe estimate consider or similar expressions are used  these forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks uncertainties and assumptions including among others a general economic downturn a downturn in the securities markets regulations that affect trading in the securities of penny stocks the enactment of united states or foreign laws rules and regulations that could have a materially adverse impact on current and intended operations and other risks and uncertainties  for additional forwardlooking statement information see the heading forwardlooking statements at the forepart of this quarterly report on page  our future results and stockholder values may differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements many of the factors that will determine these results and values are beyond our ability to control or predict  we may be required to update these forwardlooking statements from time to time as circumstances change   references to we our or us and words of similar import under this heading refer to geo point nevada unless the context implies otherwise plan of operation our business is primarily comprised of services related to identifying any recognized environmental condition rec or the lack thereof as provided by the federal state or local governmental agencies in any real property of any owner potential owner or lender governmental agency or other person that may have a concern or may have or be seeking an interest in the subject property  once our services are engaged we contract with a drilling company to drill into the ground locations selected by us to collect a physical soil sample if the project is small and can be handled by our smaller drilling equipment this service is not contracted out  once the soil sample is obtained it is submitted to a state of california certified laboratory for analysis of the existence of hazardous materials  based upon the laboratorys analysis william c lachmar our president who is a licensed professional geologist in texas and california prepares a written report that is sanctioned by the particular laboratory that conducted the analysis mr lachmars licensing as a professional geologist is a requirement to prepare any such report  if an rec is identified to exist then we will provide project management and engineering conclusions and recommendations necessary to remediate the property and bring it back into regulatory compliance based upon the california tables of acceptable levels of product contamination  acceptable levels are further qualified based upon residential commercial and industrial zoned properties with the residential levels being the most stringent  examples of contaminations that result in concern include those that are inadvertently or otherwise inoculated into the shallow subsurface soils or groundwater like gasoline diesel fuel dry cleaning fluid rocket fuel arsenic mercury lead and other toxic substances  these services are basically the same in each project examine the property drill or have it drilled for soil samples submit the soil samples to a state of california certified laboratory prepare a report on the soil samples and if an rec is found to exist provide the described services directly or through subcontractors by or under the supervision of mr lachmar  sometimes we merely assess the environmental impact of any hazardous materials found and prepare the requested report   we have provided consulting and compliance services for new utility installation and general site erosion control for housing tracts and updating service station underground storage tanks and fuel dispensing systems to comply with continually changing california air resources board carb regulations  other engineering services provided are for soil dewatering for underground structure installations and small demolition and construction work  these utility landing services comprise subsurface trench work where underground utilities are installed such as electrical fiber optic water and gas  the other engineering services are for gasoline service stations where updated monitoring equipment must be installed or the monitoring equipment shows an error code that needs to be corrected before the gas station can begin to pump gas again or where more crash posts must be installed around a propane tank other fuel or similar dispenser island or a like setting  other engineering services are to plan and construct dewatering systems for the install of subsurface structures such as underground parking lots underground storage tanks etc that are placed within a shallow groundwater zone and must be dewatered prior to construction and closure of underground water treatment systems where a manufacturing plant has underground processed water systems that treat their production waste water streams prior to discharge to the common sewer system  light construction work consists of tenant improvement buildouts and small  american disabilities act ada compliance issues such as wheelchair access ramp construction hand rail design and installation parking area upgrades and other related matters managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations three months ended december   compared to the three months ended december   during the three months ended december   we had sales of  compared to  for the three months ended december   an increase of   cost of sales for the three months ended december   was  compared to  for the three months ended december   a decrease of   cost of sales decreased during the three months ended december   due to most of our services being primarily performed by our chief executive officer the gross profit percentage increased during the period due to lack of additional costs incurred for contract work paid to third parties for their assistance and in the previous period this assistance was needed  in addition during fiscal   of our sales were generated from a related party entity whereby a limited amount was generated in the prior comparable period we have seen an increase in the need for our services due to increased activity in the construction industry in southern california  however we are continuing to see significant pressure on fees within our industry due to competition general and administrative expenses during the three months ended december   were  compared to  during the three months ended december   a decrease of   the decrease in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended december   was directly related to additional compensation paid in the prior comparable period paid to our chief executive officer nine months ended december   compared to the nine months ended december   during the nine months ended december   we had sales of  compared to  for the nine months ended december   an increase of   cost of sales for the nine months ended december   was  compared to  for the nine months ended december   an increase of   cost of sales increased during the nine months ended december   due primarily to an increase in revenues the gross profit percentage decreased during the current year due to additional costs incurred for contract work paid to third parties for

– organization and business   on june   the board of directors of geo point technologies inc a utah corporation “geo point utah” approved a stock dividend that resulted in a spinoff “spinoff” of geo point resources inc the “company” common stock to the geo point utah stockholders pro rata on the record date the “record date” prior to the spinoff the company was a whollyowned subsidiary of geo point utah the company was incorporated on june   comprising all of geo point utah’s environmental and engineering divisions’ assets business operations rights or otherwise along with its “hydrocarbon identification technology” license agreement with william c lachmar dated january    the spinoff had a “record date” of january   an exdividend date of january   and a spinoff payment date of april     note  – summary of significant accounting policies   going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern as reflected in the financial statements the company has incurred significant current period losses negative cash flows from operating activities has negative working capital an accumulated deficit and a revolving line of credit from a third party in order to fund its operations these conditions among others raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern management’s plans regarding these matters if needed include raising additional debt or equity financing the terms of which might not be acceptable to the company the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   interim financial statements   the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared by the company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission the “sec”  the accompanying balance sheet as of september   and the statements of operations and cash flows for the six months ended september   and  are unaudited the unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and in the opinion of management reflect all adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows for such periods  the financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the financial statements related to the three and six month periods are unaudited the results of the six months ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending march   any other interim period or any other future year   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements  actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates made by management include allowance for doubtful accounts and the useful life of property and equipment   fair value of financial instruments   the company complies with the accounting guidance under financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc”  fair value measurements as well as certain related fasb staff positions  this guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact business and considers assumptions that marketplace participants would use when pricing the asset or liability such as inherent risk transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance   f     the guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for measurements of fair value as follows   • level  – quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   • level  – inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities     • level  – unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities     as of september   and march   the company did not have level   or  financial assets or liabilities financial instruments consist of cash accounts receivable payables and a line of credit  the fair value of financial instruments approximated their carrying values as of september   and march   due to the shortterm nature of these items   concentration of credit risks and customer concentrations   during the six months ended september   services provided to two customers accounted for  related party and  of total revenues  during the six months ended september   services provided to two customers accounted for  and  of total revenues  one of these customers is considered a related party see note  management believes the loss of these customers would have a material impact on the company   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when it is realized and earned  the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when  it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  services have been rendered and are invoiced  the price is fixed or determinable and  collectibility is reasonably assured   the company’s primary source of revenue has been in its environmental division providing historical site data searches preliminary investigation and drilling site characterization modeling regulatory agency liaison and full environmental cleanups using such methods as vapor extraction air sparging bioremediation orc oxygen release compound and hrc hydrogen release compound injection treatment air stripping and ionic exchange  revenues from providing historical site data searches preliminary investigation and drilling site characterization modeling regulatory agency liaison and full environmental cleanups using such methods as vapor extraction air sparging bioremediation orc oxygen release compound and hrc hydrogen release compound injection treatment air stripping and ionic exchange are recognized after services have been performed  the company also has operations associated with the oil and gas segment that have limited activity and have not yet generated revenues  all revenues are reported inclusive of shipping and handling costs billed and exclusive of any taxes billed to customers if any  shipping and handling costs incurred if any are reported in cost of products sold   see note  for revenue transactions with a related party   basic and diluted income loss per common share   basic income loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period  diluted income loss per common share reflects the potential dilution to basic earnings per share that could occur upon conversion or exercise of securities options or other such items to common shares using the treasury stock method based upon the weighted average fair value of the company’s common shares during the period as of september   and  the company did not have any dilutive securities     f     note  – financial statement elements   loans receivable – construction p geo point resources inc k  form  k annual report

expressions are used  these forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks uncertainties and assumptions including among others a general economic downturn a downturn in the securities markets regulations that affect trading in the securities of “penny stocks” the enactment or amendment of laws rules and regulations that could have a materially adverse impact on current and intended operations and other risks and uncertainties   our future results and shareholder values may differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements  many of the factors that will determine these results and values are beyond our ability to control or predict  we may be required to update these forwardlooking statements from time to time as circumstances change however we undertake no duty to do so     references   references to “we” “our” or “us” and words of similar import under this heading refer to “geo point resources inc” the registrant unless the context implies otherwise   item   business   business development   on february   we filed a form a registration statement with the sec and we are now required to file reports under section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” and our directors officers  and  shareholders are required to file beneficial ownership reports with the sec on applicable forms   introduction   on june   we were formed as a whollyowned subsidiary of geo point technologies inc a utah corporation “geo point utah” and into which geo point utah simultaneously authorized the conveyance of the segment of its business comprising all of its environmental and engineering divisions’ assets business operations rights or otherwise along with its “hydrocarbon identification technology” “hi technology” license agreement dated january   the “license agreement” subject to the assumption by us of all related liabilities and the indemnification of geo point utah by us from any liabilities relating to these assets and operations  also on june   the board of directors of geo point utah approved a stock dividend that resulted in a spinoff of all of our shares of common stock to the geo point utah stockholders pro rata on a one share for one share basis on the record date the “spinoff”  the spinoff had a record date of january   and exdividend date of january   and a spinoff payment date of april    on the effective date of the spinoff there were approximately  outstanding shares of our common stock  for additional information about the spinoff see our prospectus dated january   and filed with the sec on january   and our k current report dated april   and filed with the sec on such date  see part iv item      the environmental and engineering divisions comprised the initial operations of geo point utah at its inception and were commenced as a “dba” in  by geo point utah’s founder william c lachmar our president and sole director in the state of california where these business operations are presently conducted by us     business   our business is primarily comprised of services related to identifying any recognized environmental condition “rec” or the lack thereof as provided by the federal state or local governmental agencies in any real property of        any owner potential owner or lender governmental agency or other person that may have a concern or may have or be seeking an interest in the subject property  once our services are engaged we contract with a drilling company to drill into the ground locations selected by us to collect a physical soil sample if the project is small and can be handled by our smaller drilling equipment this service is not contracted out  once the soil sample is obtained it is submitted to a state of california certified laboratory for analysis of the existence of hazardous materials  based upon the laboratory’s analysis william c lachmar our president who is a licensed professional geologist in texas and california prepares a written report that is sanctioned by the particular laboratory that conducted the analysis mr lachmar’s licensing as a “professional geologist” is a requirement to prepare any such report  if an rec is identified to exist then we will provide project management and engineering conclusions and recommendations necessary to remediate the property and bring it back into regulatory compliance based upon the california tables of acceptable levels of product contamination  acceptable levels are further qualified based upon residential commercial and industrial zoned properties with the residential levels being the most stringent  examples of contaminations that result in concern include those that are inadvertently or otherwise inoculated into the shallow subsurface soils or groundwater like gasoline diesel fuel dry cleaning fluid rocket fuel arsenic mercury lead and other toxic substances  these services are basically the same in each project examine the property drill or have it drilled for soil samples submit the soil samples to a state of california certified laboratory prepare a report on the soil samples and if an rec is found to exist provide the described services directly or through subcontractors by or under the supervision of mr lachmar  sometimes we merely assess the environmental impact of any hazardous materials found and prepare the requested report     we have provided consulting and compliance services for new utility installation and general site erosion control for housing tracts and updating service station underground storage tanks and fuel dispensing systems to comply with continually changing california air resources board “carb” regulations  other engineering services provided are for soil dewatering for underground structure installations and small demolition and construction work  these “utility landing” services comprise subsurface trench work where underground utilities are installed such as electrical fiber optic water and gas  the other engineering services are for gasoline service stations where updated monitoring equipment must be installed or the monitoring equipment shows an error code that needs to be corrected before the gas station can begin to pump gas again or where more crash posts must be installed around a propane tank other fuel or similar dispenser island or a like setting  other engineering services are to plan and construct dewatering systems for the install of subsurface structures such as underground parking lots underground storage tanks etc that are placed within a shallow groundwater zone and must be dewatered prior to construction and “closure” of underground water treatment systems where a manufacturing plant has underground processed water systems that treat their production waste water streams prior to discharge to the common sewer system  light construction work consists of tenant improvement buildouts and small american disabilities act ada compliance issues such as wheelchair access ramp construction hand rail design and installation parking area upgrades and other related matters   in addition to these business operations  we have been attempting to fund additional research of the hi technology as defined below without success to date   principal products or services and their markets   our services generally include   · construction and emergency response · demolition remediation and restoration · subsurface investigation · water and wastewater treatment · engineering and environmental consulting · environmental permitting and compliance and · litigation support          distribution methods of the products or services   we do not advertise our services in any publications and we rely primarily on past customers for repeat business including large property management companies wholesale fuel distributors and automobile dealers among others for referrals   most of our referrals come from two long standing clients or three major commercial real estate management companies in california or two health specialists to whom we pay commissions for referrals   typically a client contacts us about an environmental related issue on a particular parcel of real property  the client could be the property owner or lender seeking information on whether there is an adverse environmental issue related to the real property and if so how it can be remediated or a prospective purchaser of the particular parcel of real property or a governmental agency seeking similar information  we receive contacts on properties that have known contamination and those desiring to determine if there is any contamination  if engaged we develop an environmentally sound investigation to be conducted under our direction as a hazmat a toxic material that is radioactive flammable explosive or poisonous among others that would be a danger to life or to the environment if released without the necessary precautions specialist contractor with a licensed professional geologist on staff like our president william c lachmar  once the investigational strategy is developed and we are engaged necessary soil samples are taken and submitted by us to a california certified environmental laboratory   all field work that requires a drill rig is subcontracted though some drill work can be hand drilled through the use of a rotor hammer which is operated by mr lachmar   all chemicals required for our services are supplied by subcontractors and are readily available we do not store any regulated chemicals or waste at our facilities nor do we manufacture any such products   we have no real suppliers of products other than some environmental hand held equipment that is competitively marketed by numerous distributors and there is little chance that any equipment that is necessary to conduct our environmental services would not be available to rent or purchase   status of any publicly announced new product or service   we have not had any recent public announcement of any new product or service   competitive business conditions and smaller reporting company’s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition   our competitors include mostly large and well funded entities whose businesses and subsidiaries focus solely on the industries in which we operate  in this respect we are at a distinct disadvantage to these competitors  our services may be limited to smaller projects by reason of our limited financial resources and staff  we believe our competitive position in this industry as a whole is not presently significant   we also believe our fees for these services are usually lower than what the larger companies in this industry charge for similar services because of our lower overhead costs and our lower costs for professional oversight which is provided by our president mr lachmar  with just one employee who overseas our projects the number of projects we can handle at one time is limited based upon oversight requirements   our principal competitors are aecom technology corporation urs kleinfelter levine fricke chm hill companies ltd the reynolds group and geosyntec most all of which are larger well financed multinational publiclyheld companies or are divisions or subsidiaries of large well financed multinational companies          seasonal nature of our business   the second quarter of our fiscal year july  to september  is typically our strongest quarter the us federal government has historically authorized more work during the period preceding the end of its fiscal year september  in addition many us state governments with fiscal years ending on june  have historically accelerated spending during the fiscal first quarter when new funding budgets become available  there is no assurance that this trend will continue   insurance and risk management   risk management is an integral part of our project management approach and our project execution process  we maintain insurance covering professional liability and claims involving bodily injury and property damage with a maximum of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate we consider our present limits of coverage deductibles and reserves to be more than adequate for our present business operations based upon our assessment of the small number one claim during the past two fiscal years and to the date hereof of past claims made against us this particular claim was resolved for approximately   wherever possible we endeavor to eliminate or reduce the risk of loss on a project through the use of quality assurancecontrol risk management workplace safety and similar methods  our subcontractors are also all required to maintain adequate insurance on our projects dependence on one or a few major customers   during the fiscal year ended march   services provided to two customers accounted for  and  of total revenues  one of these customers which represented  is a related party see note  of our audited financial statements that accompany this annual report for additional information in part ii item  below  during the fiscal year ended march   services provided to three customers accounted for   and  one of these customers which represented  is a related party see note  of our audited financial

patents trademarks licenses franchises concessions royalty agreements or labor contracts including duration   we are a california general engineering construction and hazardous materials consulting company   we do not hold any patents however we have proprietary technology applications related to our hydrocarbon indicating methods and technology the “hi technology” which was developed and licensed by mr lachmar to our predecessor parent geo point utah and assigned to us on our formation on june     the material terms of the license agreement are as follows   mr lachmar granted to us an exclusive worldwide license to use the hi technology for commercial exploitation including subleasing the hi technology to other parties     the intellectual property associated with the hi technology as well as any additional related intellectual property developed by mr lachmar is included within the scope of the license  currently the intellectual property is maintained as trade secrets and protected by the confidentiality provisions of the license agreement however any patents trademarks or copyrights or applications therefor related to the hi technology will also be included within the scope of the license agreement     upon execution of the license agreement geo point utah the original licensee under the license agreement paid mr lachmar a onetime license fee of   except as otherwise provided therein and as discussed below the license agreement is irrevocable   mr lachmar retained the right to exploit the hi technology and processes            the license agreement may be terminated by either party subject to a day notice period upon a breach of the license agreement that remains uncured during the notice period     the license agreement may be terminated by mr lachmar in the event we become insolvent or unable to pay our debts as they come due become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding voluntary or involuntary other than a reorganization or enter into a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors     the hi technology underlying the license agreement which is related to petroleum geology has not been promoted to customers and requires substantial research and development of hydrocarbonindicating methods and technology  no funds were expended for research and development of the hi technology during the fiscal years ended march   and   we intend to use our proprietary hi technology if we are successful in its further development and commercialization to become a competitor in the oil and gas exploration services industry   following such research and development as we enter the commercialization stage of the hi technology development we must acquire projects and business opportunities that build the credibility of the hi technology and develop our ability to deliver quality oil and gas exploration prospect areas  substantial additional funding will be required for research and development respecting the efficacy of the hi technology to locate oil and gas prospect areas  it is estimated that approximately  will be needed for laboratory equipment to analyze attendant microwaves produced by the attendant process and that an additional sum of approximately  will be needed for testing and software development for fast video processing boards  even then assuming the hi technology functions as hoped the process to determine the best locations to drill for oil and gas will take about two years after recording data and quantifying it following the examination of zones or areas in oil and gas fields that are known to have oil and gas reserves  the professional we had intended to utilize for our research and development of this technology has been and continues to be seriously ill  we are attempting to find another person whom we believe has the qualifications necessary to assist in the research and development of this technology however with funding constraints it is not anticipated that this research and development will begin in the near future  these plans have been in place for the past three fiscal years and we have not make any progress by reason of our inability to raise the capital necessary for our development of this technology   need for any governmental approval of principal products or services   we have the necessary licenses and qualifications singly or through our subcontractors to conduct our business operations without government approval except to the extent of compliance with applicable governmental regulations related to our business which are summarized below under the heading “effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on our business” below   effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business   federal and state

practices under these acts include the most current sound scientific methods for data evaluation exposure assessment toxicity assessment and risk characterization documentation of all assumptions methods models and calculations used in the assessment including any health risk assessment  these assessments generally include   · evaluation of risks posed by acutely toxic hazardous substances based on levels at which no known or anticipated adverse effects on health will occur with an adequate margin of safety · evaluation of risks posed by carcinogens or other hazardous substances that may cause chronic disease based on a level that does not pose any significant risk to health          · consideration of possible synergistic effects resulting from exposure to or interaction with two or more hazardous substances · consideration of the effect of hazardous substances upon subgroups that comprise a meaningful portion of the general population including but not limited to infants children pregnant women the elderly individuals with a history of serious illness or other subpopulations that are identifiable as being at greater risk of adverse health effects due to exposure to hazardous substances than the general population · consideration of exposure and body burden level that alter physiological function or structure in a manner that may significantly increase the risk of illness and of exposure to hazardous substances in all media including but not limited to exposures in drinking water food ambient and indoor air and soil · if currently available scientific data is insufficient to determine the level of a hazardous substance at which no known or anticipated adverse effects on health will occur with an adequate margin of safety or the level that poses no significant risk to public health the risk assessment prepared in conjunction with a response action taken or approved shall be based on the level that is protective of public health with an adequate margin of safety  this level shall be based exclusively on public health considerations shall to the extent scientific data are available take into account the factors set forth and shall be based on the most current principles practices and methods used by public health professionals who are experienced practitioners in the fields of epidemiology risk assessment fate and transport analysis and toxicology   compliance with federal state and local laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no significant effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position  these costs are an integral part of the services that we provide  in the future compliance with environmental laws could materially adversely affect us we will continue to monitor the impact of such laws on our business and will develop appropriate compliance programs   emerging growth company   we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of

nonconvertible debt over a threeyear period   under the jobs act emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies          smaller reporting company   we became subject to the reporting requirements of section d of the exchange act subject
