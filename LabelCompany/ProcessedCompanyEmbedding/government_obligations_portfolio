recommendations fund documents prospectus and fund reports fact sheet  about risk active trading risk the fund engages in frequent trading of portfolio securities active trading results in added expenses and may result in a lower return and increased tax liability call risk if interest rates fall it is possible that issuers of debt securities with high interest rates will prepay or call their securities before their maturity dates in this event the proceeds from the called securities would likely be reinvested by the fund in securities bearing the new lower interest rates resulting in a possible decline in the funds income and distributions to shareholders changing fixed income market conditions risk the current low interest rate environment was created in part by the federal reserve board frb and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero there is a risk that interest rates will rise when the frb and central banks raise these rates this risk is heightened due to the tapering of the frbs quantitative easing program and other similar foreign central bank actions this tapering and eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments particularly those with longer maturities in addition decreases in fixed income dealer marketmaking capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets as a result the value of the funds investments and share price may decline changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the funds transaction costs collateralized loan obligations risk in addition to the normal interest rate default and other risks of fixed income securities collateralized loan obligations carry additional risks including the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default the fund may invest in collateralized loan obligations that are subordinate to other classes values may be volatile and disputes with the issuer may produce unexpected investment results credit risk the issuer of instruments in which the fund invests may be unable to meet interest andor principal payments thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and lowering the issuers credit rating derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise conversely bond prices generally rise as interest rates fall specific bonds differ in their sensitivity to changes in interest rates depending on their individual characteristics including duration management risk the investment techniques and risk analysis used by the funds portfolio managers may not produce the desired results market risk the prices of and the income generated by the funds securities may decline in response to among other things investor sentiment general economic and market conditions regional or global instability and currency and interest rate fluctuations mortgage and assetbacked securities risk the fund may invest in mortgage and assetbacked securities that are subject to prepayment or call risk which is the risk that the borrowers payments may be received earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans faster prepayments often happen when interest rates are falling as a result the fund may reinvest these early payments at lower interest rates thereby reducing the funds income conversely when interest rates rise prepayments may happen more slowly causing the security to lengthen in duration longer duration securities tend to be more volatile securities may be prepaid at a price less than the original purchase value an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool may adversely affect the value of mortgagebacked securities and could result in losses to the fund the risk of such defaults is generally higher in the case of mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages subprime mortgages refer to loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages reinvestment risk reinvestment risk is the risk that a bonds cash flows coupon income and principal repayment will be reinvested at an interest rate below that on the original bond tba transactions risk tba transactions involve the risk that the securities received may be less favorable than what was anticipated by the fund when entering into the tba transaction tba transactions also involve the risk that a counterparty will fail to deliver the securities exposing the fund to further losses whether or not the fund takes delivery of the securities at the termination date of a tba transaction the fund will nonetheless be exposed to changes in the value of the underlying investments during the term of the agreement when the fund enters into a short sale of a tba mortgage it does not own the fund may have to purchase deliverable mortgages to settle the short sale at a higher price than anticipated thereby causing a loss a short position in a tba mortgage poses more risk than holding the same tba mortgage long as there is no limit on how much the price of mortgage securities can increase the funds exposure is unlimited the fund may not always be able to purchase mortgage securities to close out the short position at a particular time or at an acceptable price the fund will earmark or segregate liquid assets in an amount at least equal to its exposure for the duration of the contract the fund will incur increased transaction costs associated with selling tba mortgages short in addition taking short positions in tba mortgages results in a form of leverage which could increase the volatility of the funds share price us government obligations risk the fund may invest in obligations issued by us government agencies and instrumentalities that may receive varying levels of support from the government which could affect the funds ability to recover should they default whenissued and delayed delivery risks whenissued and delayed delivery transactions are subject to market risk as the value or yield of a security at delivery may be more or less than the purchase price or the yield generally available on securities when delivery occurs in addition the fund is subject to counterparty risk because it relies on the buyer or seller as the case may be to consummate the transaction and failure by the other party to complete the transaction may result in the fund missing the opportunity of obtaining a price or yield considered to be advantageous zero coupon or payinkind securities risk the value interest rates and liquidity of noncash paying instruments such as zero coupon and payinkind securities are subject to greater fluctuation than other types of securities the higher yields and interest rates on payinkind securities reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments and that such investments may represent a higher credit risk than coupon loans payinkind securities may have a potential variability in valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral as of  agovx nav change    nas may appear until data is available data is

insights  analysis commentary a word on the markets as of mar   financial markets posted widespread gains in the first quarter key themes driving the broad rally included optimism about the trump administrations progrowth agenda stronger european economic data and improving sentiment on emerging markets treasury yields finished the quarter almost exactly where they began but it was a volatile quarter with yields touching multiyear highs before retracing lower in the last two weeks the initial move higher was aided by a newly hawkish federal reserve  the fed emboldened by expansionary fiscal policy in the us and receding risks to stability abroad the markets rosy outlook turned negative in the last two weeks of the quarter following the administrations failure to pass healthcare reform and ris ing uncertainty surrounding french elections and north korea entering the second quarter the market must weigh an economy potentially running hot at  unemployment the lowest reading since march  versus the increasingly dangerous geopolitical landscape importantly it seems the fed is more concerned wit h the former as they have increased talk of winding down their trn balance

were a leading driver of performance and benefited from a slowdown in prepayment speeds stemming from the increase in mortgage rates in the fourth quarter the funds investments in fixed rate agency cmos also aided performance during the period as the securities outperformed treasuries despite slight spread widening detractors  the funds investments in agency adjustable rate mortgages slightly underperformed treasuries during the quarter due to their shorter durations investment outlook and fund positioning  management believes that although the us economy remains on a solid footing the likelihood of tail risk events which could have a positive or negative impact on financial markets have increased due to the change in us political leadership and the gr owing geopolitical uncertainties against this backdrop management believes agency mbs remain an attractive investment opportunity as they provide investors with an attractive spread over treasuries without taking credit risk in the current low yield environment it is important not to reach for yield and be mindful of interestrate risk as such management believes agency mbs with minimal extension risk and more stable prepayment profiles remain extremely attractive in the current rate environment credit quality as of mar   aaa  total  ratings are based on moodys sp or fitch as applicable if securities are rated
