the kind of day cfos dream about her company nvidia just reported its best quarter in history shares jumped nearly  percent in a single day reaching a new alltime high if you bought  worth of stock this time last year it’s now worth nearly  “the success we see today is a long journey with a lot of work by a tremendous team of people” kress told the silicon valley business journal the morning after reporting the company’s thirdquarter earnings “i’m truly truly fortunate to be part of the team and carry the flag on the financials” enlarge colette kress executive vice president and chief financial officer company nvidia… more vicki thompson kress is one of the silicon valley business journal’s  cfos of the year while her impact at nvidia is so much more than its balance sheet or its share price kress steering the company’s financials has been unquestionably valuable when she joined the company in late  wall street valued nvidia at  billion today it’s worth  billion the company made  billion in revenue in its most recent quarter that’s about twice as much revenue as the company was making per quarter when she joined the santa clarabased chipmaker has historically made highpowered graphics processing units or gpu chips for the video game market in recent years the company has invested outside its core products establishing beachheads in rapidly growing markets “we’re growing from a graphics company to an ai and computingfocused company” kress said “growth areas in front of us are new areas we’re going to see in the next  to  years we’re focused on virtual reality artificial intelligence and selfdriving cars transformational opportunities where the gpu in this sense is perfectly aligned” kress is a technologist at heart having worked her entire career in tech first at texas instruments followed by executive finance roles at microsoft and cisco she admits she spends most of her day looking at balance sheets but the line items are more than abstract widgets to her “understanding the role of the cfo is to understand the business i support” she says “i’m the first to ask ‘how does the business work’” working at a chipmaker offers unique challenges — research and development is expensive and the demand for technical innovation is relentless nvidia’s engineers are expected to push the boundaries of what’s possible on a silicon chip a little further every day and while nvidia’s won ground in ai selfdriving cars and data center chips their competitors are similarly relentless eager to create the next killer chip kress’ past employers — microsoft and cisco — were both the dominant players in their markets batting away their smaller competitors it’s different at nvidia which is the young upstart compared to larger companies like intel kress said the corporate culture at nvidia felt right “nvidia is a very flat organization a very collaborative organization where we get together and get work done” kress said “the leadership and culture here has been such a unique match” join the conversation follow svbizjournal on twitter like us on facebook and sign up for our free email newsletters highest paid cfos ranked by  total
