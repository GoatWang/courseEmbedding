worldwide nysehot was the prize in a bruising takeover fight recently won by marriott international image source starwood property trust  starwood hotels might be the starwood grabbing headlines lately but starwood property trust deserves some attention in its own right its a big busy mortgage reit with a unique slant on its business whether its a winning stock is another question lets take a brief look at the company and find out real estate starsstarwood property trust is the creation of ace real estate operator barry sternlicht who was also the leading light at both financial services company starwood capital group and starwood hotels  resorts he still serves as ceo of property trust and capital group although the hotelier has been in different hands for some time starwood property trust isnt a traditional mortgage reit plowing its capital into mortgagebacked securities instead its primary business is the direct financing of real estate projects lending money to those that are unwilling or unable to get the credit they need from more traditional sources that doesnt mean these borrowers are unworthy in the wake of last decades financial crisis banks and other commercial lenders now operate with many restrictions as to how they can extend credit as a nonbank entity starwood property trust has far fewer obstacles which is quite an advantage especially with this company sternlicht has a long and genuinely distinguished history in real estate and that experience informs starwood property trusts business operationally soundso how exactly does this shake out in starwood property trusts results as far as fundamentals are concerned starwood property trust is still a relatively young company it went public in  and is growing comparatively fast annual revenue has more than tripled since  to last years  million trailingmonth funds from operations the crucial profitability metric for reits as it strips out depreciation and several smaller line items have seen a nearly  jump over that time that compares very favorably to several big names in the reit world mreit annaly capital nysenly and equity player realty income stwd funds from operations ttm data by ycharts but as you can see starwood property trusts ttm ffo is down from its early  peak that has affected the stock price especially when combined with the markets general fear of fresh rate hikes affecting the business of mreits in theory higher rates raise the cost of a reits funding thereby narrowing the spread between its higher funding costs and its returns the difference in price development is stark equity reit realty income has done well over the past year while its mortgage cousin annaly capital hasnt gone anywhere starwood property trust is in the same boat with another big mreit american mortgage capital with both declining around the  mark stwd data by ycharts rising to the surfacea drop in price of course makes the dividend yield higher thanks to its stocks decline starwood property trusts pershare quarterly payout yields a shade over  these days that alone makes it a compelling investment case for income investors but its not only the dividend starwood property trust is a unique operator in the mreit space its a goto option for commercial real estate funding it knows how to finance even the most unusual or complex projects and most importantly it understands very well how to turn a robust profit doing so so its a solid play on fundamentals too in my opinion and its price drop is undeserved this makes it a clear bargain at the current price the mreit sea is big and these days often choppy starwood property trust though is a very sturdy ship with a solid crew id put money on it staying well afloat rather than sinking in the coming years eric
