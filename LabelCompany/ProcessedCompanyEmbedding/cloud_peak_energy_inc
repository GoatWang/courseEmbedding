shipments reducing capital expenditure guidance in the light of continued successes in our asset management programs secured approval from the wyoming department of environmental quality to release and selfbond  million of reclamation surety bonds this will help reduce ongoing surety premiums and is a reflection on the continued financial strength of cloud peak energy maintained strong balance sheet with cash of  million and available liquidity of  million colin marshall president and chief executive officer commented “we were disappointed that rail service interruptions continued to impact our shipments in the second quarter however we controlled costs and capital expenditures and we were pleased with the resulting financial performance we are continuing to work diligently with the railroad to understand their plans for improvement in the meantime customer stockpiles of prb coal are at low levels and prb coal remains a lower cost fuel source compared to natural gas we will continue to focus on controlling costs as we await improved rail service to allow us to ship our contracted tons through the rest of the year” health and safety record we were saddened by the death of a haul truck operator at our spring creek mine in a single truck incident in june our thoughts and condolences go to his family friends and colleagues we are supporting the mine safety and health administration “msha” during their investigation and are awaiting their findings into the cause of this incident during the second quarter of  of our approximately  fulltime mine site employees two

release during the second quarter fines of  were assessed on the eight citations we received in the first quarter in recognition of our commitment to safety the cordero rojo mine was notified that it

and reconciliation below in this release and the attached tables   while demand from our customers was very strong second quarter  tons sold from our owned and operated mines segment were limited by rail service interruptions which persisted throughout the quarter we understand the railways are taking measures to improve service but that recent seasonal flooding and poor weather have delayed their efforts we will continue to work with the railways and our customers to maximize shipments of contracted  tons through the rest of the year revenue from our owned and operated mines segment increased in the second quarter of  compared to  due to a slightly higher average realized price per ton sold and higher tons shipped for the quarter the total cost of product sold decreased slightly which combined with slightly higher tons sold led to the reduction in cost per ton we continued to achieve significant cost and capital savings from our inhouse condition monitoring and repair work these savings were partially offset by higher labor and fuel costs associated with the additional workload and tons shipped we continue to plan for higher shipment rates for the rest of the year which we expect to further reduce our average costs per ton as the year progresses logistics and related activities our logistics and related activities segment comprises the results of our logistics and transportation services to our domestic and international customers                         quarter ended year to date in millions                     total tons delivered     asian export tons

measure please see definition and reconciliation below in this release and the attached tables   delivered shipments to our domestic and asian customers decreased slightly in the second quarter of  compared to  due to rail service issues on the northwest rail corridor along with weak international market prices for seaborne thermal coal this resulted in lower revenue for the quarter we have experienced increased demurrage costs so far this year as ships were delayed at the terminal waiting for coal recently demurrage has been decreasing as we continued to work closely with our customers the bnsf railway and westshore terminals to improve scheduling while rail delays continue our forward sales hedging program mitigated some of the impact of lower spot prices with a realized gain of  million in the second quarter balance sheet and cash flow cash flow from operations totaled  million for the second quarter of  capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest were  million none of which was financed under capital leases for the first six months of  operations generated cash flow of almost  million excluding the  million of refinancing costs paid in the first quarter capital expenditures were  million including assets acquired under capital leases as of june   unrestricted cash and investments were  million and total available liquidity was  million during the quarter we received approval from the wyoming department of environmental quality to selfbond and release  million of the surety bonds held to cover reclamation obligations in accordance with wyoming regulations the approval to release and self bond this amount is a reflection of our balance sheet strength and will also help us save around  million per year in surety premium costs outlook based on data from the energy information administration through april  us electric generation from coalfired power was up seven percent and coal consumption was  million tons up  million tons compared to last year we understand that inventory levels vary significantly from utility to utility with some having very low levels forcing them to conserve their coal burn total electricity generation is up four percent while natural gas generation was down three percent which emphasizes the importance of coalfired generation as a reliable lowcost energy source for the us during the second quarter of  domestic coal market fundamentals continued to be favorable but the lingering performance issues with the western railroads have forced several utilities to conserve coal during the quarter in anticipation of normal summer burn requirements even with utilities conserving coal inventories are at the lowest levels in many years due to a slow start to the summer cooling season and increased gas production natural gas storage is recovering from very low levels at the end of the winter natural gas prices have remained consistently above mmbtu making prb coal economic where it is available domestic utility stockpiles of prb coal are estimated to have fallen to  million tons at the end of june  down  percent or  million tons from a year ago we and our customers will continue to focus on ensuring the rail delivery of their contracted coal so far this year we have seen an increase in requests for additional coal for delivery this year as we are fully sold out for  we have not been bidding on these requests while shipments over the first half of the year have been disappointing we continue to expect an improvement in deliveries in the second half of the year with the planned improved deliveries we believe that prices will be supported based on fundamentals of strong coal consumption well below normal coal inventories and more sustainable natural gas prices internationally we continue to see strong demand from our asian customers which continues to be met by increased supply from projects commissioned several years ago leading to current weak pricing during the first half of  we saw strong interest in spring creek coal in our primary focused markets of south korea japan and taiwan as they work to increase generation in the face of growing demand and reduced nuclear generation these countries are moving ahead with numerous projects to build additional modern coalfired generation which will be designed to consume highgrade subbituminous coal including our benchmark spring creek coal for  we have contracted to sell  million tons from our three owned and operated mines of this committed  production  million tons are under fixedprice contracts with a weightedaverage price of  per ton during the quarter we fixed prices on approximately  million tons of previously contracted indexed coal for  deliveries at an average price of approximately  per ton for  we have currently committed to sell  million tons from our three owned and operated mines of this committed  production  million tons are under fixedprice contracts with a weightedaverage price of  per ton during the quarter we contracted approximately  million tons for  delivery at an average price of  per ton reflecting the mix between  btu and  btu coal and prevailing market prices we are continuing to forecast  export shipments through westshore of between  and  million tons demand from our international customers continues to be strong and we continue to seek to fill all available capacity at westshore while working to minimize demurrage costs due to rail interruptions delaying shipments at current international pricing levels there is little logistics margin available on our export sales however we continue to benefit from the margins realized by our owned and operated mines segment and through our hedge positions as a result of our lower than expected second quarter shipments we are reducing our  shipment guidance by one million tons to  to  million tons this will still require an expected improvement in rail performance through the end of the year due to the strong cost control shown by the operations we are maintaining our adjusted ebitda guidance range of  to  million for the full year we are reducing our capital expenditure range by approximately  million to a new range of  to  million marshall commented “during the quarter we were able to manage costs well despite lower than expected shipments to produce a solid adjusted ebitda result we have also been able to maintain our strong balance sheet and liquidity position to secure ourselves against the risk of a delayed market improvement looking forward our customers are keen to take their contracted coal to rebuild their stockpiles in time for winter and our mines are well positioned with stripping and inventory to supply the coal as long as rail performance improves as anticipated we are optimistic that the second half of the year will improve over the first half and that increased shipments will allow coal burn to normalize leading to improved pricing for future years”  guidance

new information future events or otherwise except as required by law nongaap financial measures this release and our related presentation include the nongaap financial measures of  adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis and for our reporting segments and  adjusted earnings per share “adjusted eps” adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” a quantitative reconciliation of historical net income loss to adjusted ebitda and eps as defined below to adjusted eps is found in the tables accompanying this release ebitda represents net income loss or income loss from continuing operations as applicable before  interest income expense net  income tax provision  depreciation and depletion  amortization and  accretion adjusted ebitda represents ebitda as further adjusted to exclude specifically identified items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations for the periods presented herein the specifically identified items are  adjustments to exclude the updates to the tax agreement liability including tax impacts of our  initial public offering and  secondary offering  adjustments for derivative financial instruments excluding fair value marktomarket gains or losses and including cash amounts received or paid and  adjustments to exclude a significant broker contract that expired in the first quarter of  because of the inherent uncertainty related to the items identified above management does not believe it is able to provide a meaningful forecast of the comparable gaap measures or reconciliation to any forecasted gaap measures adjusted eps represents diluted earnings loss per common share attributable to controlling interest or diluted earnings loss per common share attributable to controlling interest from continuing operations as applicable “eps” adjusted to exclude i the estimated per share impact of the same specifically identified items used to calculate adjusted ebitda as described above and ii the cash and noncash interest expense associated with the early retirement of debt and refinancing transactions all items are adjusted at the statutory tax rate of approximately  percent adjusted ebitda is an additional tool intended to assist our management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decisionmaking by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations adjusted ebitda is a metric intended to assist management in evaluating operating performance comparing performance across periods planning and forecasting future business operations and helping determine levels of operating and capital investments periodtoperiod comparisons of adjusted ebitda are intended to help our management identify and assess additional trends potentially impacting our company that may not be shown solely by periodtoperiod comparisons of net income loss or income loss from continuing operations our chief operating decision maker uses adjusted ebitda as a measure of segment performance consolidated adjusted ebitda is also used as part of our incentive compensation program for our executive officers and others we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps are also useful to investors analysts and other external users of our consolidated financial statements in evaluating our operating performance from period to period and comparing our performance to similar operating results of other relevant companies adjusted ebitda allows investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense taxes depreciation and depletion amortization and accretion and other specifically identified items that are not considered to directly reflect our core operations similarly we believe our use of adjusted eps provides an appropriate measure to use in assessing our performance across periods given that this measure provides an adjustment for certain specifically identified significant items that are not considered to directly reflect our core operations the magnitude of which may vary significantly from period to period and thereby have a disproportionate effect on the earnings per share reported for a given period our management recognizes that using adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps as performance measures has inherent limitations as compared to net income loss income loss from continuing operations eps or other gaap financial measures as these nongaap measures exclude certain items including items that are recurring in nature which may be meaningful to investors adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps should not be considered in isolation and do not purport to be alternatives to net income loss income loss from continuing operations eps or other gaap financial measures as a measure of our operating performance because not all companies use identical calculations our presentations of adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies moreover our presentation of adjusted ebitda is different than ebitda as defined in our debt financing agreements                   cloud peak energy inc unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations

there were no borrowings outstanding under the ar securitization program which had an available borrowing capacity of approximately  million on january   the ar securitization program was amended to extend the term to january   to allow for the ability to issue letters of credit and to reduce the combined maximum borrowing capacity subject to terms and conditions for both cash and letters of credit to  million at march   the available borrowing capacity under the  million credit agreement was approximately  million which reflects approximately  million of outstanding undrawn letters of credit used as collateral for its reclamation bonds the company ended the quarter with total available liquidity of  million throughout  and early  the company made considerable progress improving its financial position as it exited reclamation selfbonding completed exchange offers on its senior notes and renegotiated the throughput contracts with westshore and bnsf during the quarter the company issued  million shares of common stock for proceeds net of underwriting discounts and commissions of  million these proceeds were used to retire the remaining  senior notes which were redeemed including a premium of  and accrued and unpaid interest for a total payment of  million the company now has no debt maturities until  government affairs the early actions of the trump administration and congress have brought some welcome regulatory relief for the industry the overturning of the stream protection rule using the congressional review act and the recent executive orders that directed a review of the waters of the us rule and the clean power plan the lifting of the federal coalleasing moratorium and halting of the associated programmatic environmental impact statement will help us coal producers the suspension and reevaluation of the  federal coal valuation rule is also a positive change for the company’s export logistics business as the department of the interior reverts to the previous longstanding methodology during this reevaluation and removes the complexity and uncertainty that the new rule would have introduced these actions are important and welcome serving to add predictability and eliminate new and unnecessary costs for mining operations looking forward the company is optimistic that congress and the current administration will support the development and commercialization of advanced coal technology as well as establish a regulatory framework that gives utilities the confidence to invest in the nation’s critical coal power plant fleet which provides safe reliable and affordable electricity across the us domestic outlook mine shipments to domestic customers for the first quarter were  million tons in line with customer schedules and reflecting the usual seasonal suspension of shipments on the great lakes with natural gas prices around  per mmbtu utilities have maintained their consumption levels of prb coal and are taking their contracted coal the latest data from the us energy information administration “eia” shows that natural gas inventories have declined by  bcf or  percent due to winter heating demand and reduced production compared to  levels energy ventures analysis “eva” estimates that prb coal inventories at utilities were  million tons as of the end of the first quarter of  a decline of  million tons from first quarter  levels unfortunately the very mild winter prevented prb stockpiles from declining further resulting in continued elevated levels full year shipments will largely depend on the level of summer cooling demand natural gas prices and associated coal burn these factors will dictate the level of third quarter coal buying and shipments utilities require in preparation for winter for  the company is currently planning to ship between  and  million tons with current commitments to sell  million tons which includes  million tons with export customers of this committed production  million tons are under fixedprice contracts with a weightedaverage price of  per ton the approximately  million committed tons for  that the company priced during the first quarter of  were at an average price of  per ton in line with the prevailing prices at that time the company is currently contracted to sell  million tons in  all to domestic customers of this committed production  million tons are under fixedprice contracts with a weightedaverage price of  per ton utilities continue to delay new coal purchases due to their elevated stockpiles after the very mild winter while this maximizes their flexibility it could lead to some price support for coal during periods of increased natural gas prices and electricity demand “the current outlook for us thermal coal producers is a lot brighter than it was at this time last year after good first quarter shipments many of our customers are indicating that they will continue to take their contracted tons and will buy more coal for inyear delivery if summer demand is elevated we remain optimistic that the prb could see yearoveryear demand grow by approximately  million tons or more if natural gas prices remain above  per mmbtu and we have a normal summer” said marshall international outlook international thermal coal prices remained solid during the first quarter of  as china continued to manage its domestic production levels and increase imports this left international coal supplies better matched to demand disruptions to australian coal producers caused by cyclone debbie in late march are forecast to impact the rail system until early may while metallurgical coal prices have risen rapidly newcastle thermal coal prices have stabilized above  per tonne it will take some time for the full impacts of the disruption from cyclone debbie to work their way through the system as buyers wait for supply to resume or find alternative coal sources sustained international prices have allowed the company to book export sales of  million tons for delivery throughout  strong demand should allow total  export sales volumes of approximately  million tons dependent on the capacity of the rail and port system to increase shipment rates the company continues to receive strong interest from asian customers for its spring creek coal and will seek to layer in sales for the remainder of  as opportunities arise  guidance – financial and operational estimates “first quarter shipments showed a marked improvement over the first quarter of  with solid demand from both domestic and international customers although the early end to winter and export rail challenges negatively impacted our performance we are now looking ahead to steady summer demand and normalized export rail performance while  will hold plenty of challenges including a traditionally soft second quarter the actions we took in  to control our costs and improve our financial position mean we are well placed to successfully manage through the current environment and prosper as it improves” commented marshall as explained in the february  earnings call reaching the top of the adjusted ebitda range would have required an increase in the price of export sales from then prevailing levels to reflect yeartodate sales made since then the company is lowering the top end of its adjusted ebitda guidance range by  million to  million the following table provides the

required by law nongaap financial measures this release and our related presentation include the nongaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis and for our reporting segments adjusted ebitda is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “us gaap” a quantitative reconciliation of historical net income loss to adjusted ebitda is found in the tables accompanying this release ebitda represents net income loss before  interest income expense net  income tax provision  depreciation and depletion and  amortization adjusted ebitda represents ebitda as further adjusted for accretion which represents noncash increases in asset retirement obligation liabilities resulting from the passage of time and specifically identified items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations for the periods presented herein the specifically identified items are  adjustments to exclude noncash impairment charges  adjustments for derivative financial instruments excluding fair value marktomarket gains or losses and including cash amounts received or paid  adjustments to exclude debt restructuring costs and  noncash throughput amortization expense related to payments made to amend the bnsf and westshore agreements we enter into certain derivative financial instruments such as put options that require the payment of premiums at contract inception the reduction in the premium value over time is reflected in the marktomarket gains or losses our calculation of adjusted ebitda does not include premiums paid for derivative financial instruments either at contract inception as these payments pertain to future settlement periods or in the period of contract settlement as the payment occurred in a preceding period in prior years the amortization of port and rail contract termination payments were included as part of ebitda and adjusted ebitda because the cash payments approximated the amount of amortization being taken during the year during  management determined that the noncash portion of amortization arising from payments made in prior years as well as the amortization of contract termination payments should be adjusted out of ebitda because the ongoing cash payments are now significantly smaller than the overall amortization of these payments and no longer reflect the transactional results because of the inherent uncertainty related to the items identified above management does not believe it is able to provide a meaningful forecast of the comparable gaap measures or reconciliation to any forecasted gaap measure adjusted ebitda is an additional tool intended to assist our management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations adjusted ebitda is a metric intended to assist management in evaluating operating performance comparing performance across periods planning and forecasting future business operations and helping determine levels of operating and capital investments periodtoperiod comparisons of adjusted ebitda are intended to help our management identify and assess additional trends potentially impacting our company that may not be shown solely by periodtoperiod comparisons of net income loss consolidated adjusted ebitda is also used as part of our incentive compensation program for our executive officers and others we believe adjusted ebitda is also useful to investors analysts and other external users of our consolidated financial statements in evaluating our operating performance from period to period and comparing our performance to similar operating results of other relevant companies adjusted ebitda allows investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense taxes depreciation and depletion amortization and accretion and other specifically identified items that are not considered to directly reflect our core operations our management recognizes that using adjusted ebitda as a performance measure has inherent limitations as compared to net income loss or other gaap financial measures as this nongaap measure excludes certain items including items that are recurring in nature which may be meaningful to investors as a result of these exclusions adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation and does not purport to be an alternative to net income loss or other gaap financial measures as a measure of our operating performance because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies cloud peak energy inc unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss in thousands
