had posted for inside sales manager went through the interview and he asked what was the salary i was looking for i told him the number i was looking for and he said that seems ok but i will check with my accountant and talk with my partner a couple of days later i received the call stating i got the position and another person was brought on as well had another conversation about my salary and was again told the pay rate was ok even though the accountant hasnt got back with him i was informed that the office they had rented out was under construction and should be around  days from completion i was fine with that since i knew up front he said he was going to bring me in a couple days early to perform training that he said was going to be paidon two separate conversations i asked on how the company was wanting me trainteachmentorhelp out the other new person to be successful which i would have loved to do so its day  by now and construction has been delayed but we still meet for a lunch meeting where he wanted to basically renegotiate the salary by decreasing it  a month but the commission would stay the same red flag  at that same lunch meeting he stated it disturbed him that i asked how he would like for me to mentor the other new employee with very little sales experience twice i was confused at this point hence the inside sales manager position title and assuming that teaching some sales techniques would fall under the positions responsibilities red flag day  or so by now and finally its the first day to start i was fired in the parking lot for being  mins

digital radiography dr have gained popularity in the last few years flat panel detectors are currently used on a range of systems from high energy systems  mev to microfocus sub micron imaging systems current technological developments have resulted from the adoption of flat panel technology in advanced specialized medical equipment such as accuray’scyberknife treatment planning system andvarian’s advanced d imaging and radiation therapy equipment flat panel detectors are slowly replacing image intensifiers in today industrial and medical equipment flat panel detector offer several advantage over image intensifiers including lower signal to noise ratio no pin cushion distortion adjustable frame rate scintillator optimization wider dynamic range improved spatial resolution proper scintillator selection is very important for optimal flat panel performance scintillator’s can improve the gain photon capture at high kv mev range spatial resolution there are also specialized scintillator for neutron radiography contact one of our level iii engineers to discuss your scintillator needs iis will will work with you to provide a customized flat panel detector for optimal high energy neutron or modified system that meets your specific needs if you are interested in converting your existing real time system image intensifier based system to a digital system the team at iis can help you make the conversion flat panel detectorsflat panel detectors  computed radiography cr computed radiography technology employs imaging plates phosphor plates which similar to classic xray film when irradiated store a latent radiographic image for an unspecified period of time the image plate is then inserted into a specialized scanner a laser beam scans the imaging plate with a preselected scanning resolution to digitize the latent image before it is sent to a high resolution computer for post processing after the scan it is possible to erase the latent mage this is done with an integrated unit this plate can then be rescued to create another image computed radiography cr is rapidly displacing xray film use in the medical and industrial markets this rapid replacement of film is driven by the inherent advantages of cr technology computed radiographyadvantagesadditional information cr technology is a green replacement for film cr technology does not utilize hazards chemicalsmaterials imaging plates are reusable no consumable return on investment roi is very good image quality is comparable to film dynamic range is superior to that of film flaw detection is as good better than film cr technology is more time efficient than traditional film industry standards are now in place for cr replacement of film cr imaging plates have a superior dynamic range when compared to conventional films resulting in exposure times that are only  of the equivalent exposure time for agfa d film dark room no longer required cr plates can be handled in indirect light industry leading technology from fuji and allpro us air force commissioned arinc to investigate the replacement of xray film with cr the resulting paper compares defect detection and the cost of using cr vs film to download the air force research white paper follow this link replacing film with cr not to be outdone the us navy also documented their finding on converting to cr to download a copy of the navy presentation follow this link to cr in the pacific northwest this white paper is an interesting article on the use of cr in restoring paintings this paper was written for medical radiographers however it is a very good discussion on basic cr principles this is one of the better presentations on industrial radiography adoption of cr by dr u zscherpel  bam berlin cr is the digital imaging process that is nearly a plug and play replacement for xray film and like film you can need to select the cr system that best meets the needs of your application iis will work with you to help you select the ideal cr system ultra high resolution this is our ultra high resolution cr scanner with spatial resolution grater than twenty line pars per mm  lpmm to obtain this high resolution the scanner needs special high resolution phosphor storage plate psp using a standard psp yields a resolution comparable to the ndt unit shown above it is designed to work with phosphor storage plate psp in all common film sizes up to fourteen inches wide it also works with custom sized plates ie  x  inch plates for panoramic weld inspection this unit is normally configured with a desktop work station and a high resolution high contrast twenty one inch lcd display but can be adapted to other specifications cr emergency response eod unit this rugged and durable portable unit is ideal for field use the system can handle phosphor storage plates psp in all common film sizes up to twelve inches wide as well as customized psp for field use it is configured with a panasonic toughbook computer and the iis iview software this scanner works equally well for low output pulsed sources like the golden engineering unit or with isotope sources cr non destructive test ndt high contrast this scanner most popular with our ndt customers it works well with all types of sources including microfocus linear accelerators and isotope it is designed to work with phosphor storage plate psp in all common film sizes up to fourteen inches wide it also works with custom sized plates ie  x  inch plates for panoramic weld inspection this unit is normally configured with a desktop work station and a high resolution high contrast twentyone inch lcd display but can be adapted to other specifications if you are unsure what is the best cr unit for your needs contact one of our level iii engineer for advice or to schedule a demo linear diode arrays linear diode arrays lda are one of the older and most widely used digital imagers lda’s are utilize a a scintillator directly coupled to a photo diode to convert the xrays into an electronic signal this direct couple configuration allow for collimating of each pixel the columniation of each pixel allows for thicker scintillator with out getting scintillator blur with thicker scintillator these imagers become ideal for high speed imaging and low dose applications this is why lda images are commonly used in conveyer fed imaging systems the collimated pixels with thick scintillator are the imager of choice for ct and cargo inspection system as the provide superior signal to noise ratio linear diode arrayslda advantages high speed imaging no blur at high speed significantly higher frame rates that allow for higher speed part manipulation inherent noise rejection superior signal to noise ratio high dynamic range larger denser parts custom sizes and resolutions are cost effectively built thicker scintillators for high energy applications contact one of our level iii engineer to discuss how
