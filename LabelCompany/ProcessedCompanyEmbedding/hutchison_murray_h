nanomaterials through a combination of synthetic chemistry and stateoftheart surface and nanoscale characterization techniques we are able to discover new materials properties that can be optimized for a wide range of applications we design structures to exhibit a desired function and test the efficacy of the new materials for specific applications such as electronic and optical devices catalysts and sensors to prepare functional nanostructures and extended materials we synthesize functionalized organic and inorganic chemical building blocks that are designed to assemble into organized structures such as films lines or devices our designs for new processes and materials draw heavily on the principles of environmentallyfriendly or green chemistrygreener nanoscience—high performance greener nanomaterials and nanomanufacturing many applications in nanoscience ranging from those in medicine to nanoelectronics will make use of specifically functionalized nanoparticles andor nanoparticle arrays we investigate new synthetic methods that permit us to tune the properties of nanoparticles and develop more efficient greener approaches to nanoparticle synthesismanufacture our diverse libraries of nanoparticles are being used to assess the physical and biological properties of these new materials with the aim of applying this knowledge to design effective and safe materials we also develop methods of nanofabrication based upon the assembly of functionalized nanoparticles two examples of applications of these assemblies are the bottom up assembly of heterogeneous catalysts and biomolecular nanolithography a method that involves selfassembly of nanoparticles onto biopolymeric dna scaffolds to form lines and more complex patterns for the generation of molecularly integrated nanocircuits as a higher performance and greener approach in the microelectronics industryconformationally preorganized malonamides as ligands and materials for fblock ion chemistrydesigning effective metal ion receptors is an important challenge in inorganic and supramolecular chemistry in addition to improving our understanding of ionreceptor interactions such studies lead to new receptors that are useful in applications that involve sensing separating sequestering and delivering metal ions by “preorganizing” a malonamide ligand so that the donor groups are ideally positioned for binding a  millionfold enhancement in binding for fblock ions is achieved we are exploring the coordination chemistry of this new ligand class and using the members of this class as building blocks for the preparation of functional materials including membranebased separations ionsensitive surfaces polymeric ion sequestering agents and sensorsfunctionalized metal and oxide surfacesorganic thin films on surfaces are important model systems for studying interfacial phenomena and have a number of important applications in fields ranging from materials science to biomedicine selfassembled monolayers sams are formed by adsorption of molecules onto surfaces to yield a single molecular layer currently we are designing new adsorbate molecules through which we can systematically control linkages and patterning on metal and oxide surfaces and introduce chemical functionality to control the interactions of nanomaterials and biomolecules with these surfaces
