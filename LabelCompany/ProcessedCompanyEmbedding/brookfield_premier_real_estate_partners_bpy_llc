mr cherry please go ahead matt cherry thank you and good morning everyone before we begin our presentation let me caution you that our discussion will include forwardlooking statements these statements that relate to future results and events are based on our current expectations our actual results and future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks uncertainties and assumptions the risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are material are outlined in our press release issued this morning with that ill turn the call over to chief executive officer brian kingston brian kingston thank you matt and good morning everyone thank you for joining the call today with me on the call are ric clark the chairman of bpy and bryan davis our cfo in my prepared remarks ill discuss our activities and accomplishments from the quarter as well as providing some observations and real estate fundamentals and the investment environment that were seeing in our various markets around the globe bryan will then go through the details of our quarterly financial results and then following those comments wed be happy to take questions from any analysts or investors on the call today so as you would have seen in our disclosure this morning we reported another strong quarter our company ffo was  million or  per unit which is a  increase over the prior period and our seventh consecutive quarter of yearoveryear ffo earnings growth our results this quarter benefited from strong performance in our core office business as well as growth from our opportunistic investment segment capital recycling remains one of our key priorities and weve made significant progress in this initiative during the first several months of the quarter after raising approximately  billion of net equity from asset sales in  we set a goal to raise an additional  billion to  billion over the course of  premier wellleased properties in core markets continue to attract interest from global investors seeking stable bondlike yields and consistent with the dispositions we completed last year we expect to complete these sales at very attractive prices the capital raise from these sales will be used in part to fund the ongoing construction of our  million square feet of development projects around the globe the returns associated with these developments will be meaningfully higher than the assets that were selling and are being developed to modern specifications to ensure the continued to meet our tenants demands well into the future as has been reported we are close to finalizing the sale of our  interest in  park avenue in manhattan in a transaction that values the building at more than  billion and will generate net proceeds to bpy of over  million while this is a trophy asset in the muchsoughtafter grand central corridor that commands some of the highest rents in new york we felt this capital could be better deployed elsewhere at higher returns in addition our private real estate funds have begun harvesting capital through realizations of maturing investments during the quarter these funds returned approximately  million of capital to bpy which will be used to fund our capital commitments to future opportunistic strategies following the end of the quarter we entered to an agreement with brookfield canada office properties to acquire the  equity interest in box we did not already own for approximately cad million or cad per unit similarly we entered into a agreement to acquire the remaining  of the brookfield prime property fund in australia for aud million as we continue to amalgamate our listed subsidiaries into bpy as flagship public vehicle both of these transactions will also allow us to streamline operations and processes reduce administrative costs shareholder meetings to approve both of these proposals are scheduled for june we also remain very active in putting capital to work on behalf of our opportunistic strategies investing approximately  million at bpy share through brookfield managed opportunity fun to acquire a portfolio of  student housing assets in the uk and preferred equity investment in hospitality reit jones  selectservice hotels throughout the united states on the corporate side during the first quarter we repurchased over  million bpy units at an average price of  per unit a  discount to our ifrs value per unit this significant increase in our buyback activity relative to prior years affirms our commitment to this strategy and as long as our units continue to trade at a significant discount to their intrinsic value we will continue to allocate resources to buyback i will now turn the call over to bryan davis for the detailed finance report bryan davis thank you brian during the first quarter we are in company ffo of  million compared with  million for the same period in  on a per unit basis company ffo for the current quarter was  per unit compared with  per unit in the prior year at an increase of  which was an increase of  with strong operating performance across most of our business units more than offset the impact of the conversion of foreign income into fewer us dollars bpy recorded a net loss attributable to unitholders for the quarter of  million or  per unit compared with net income of  million or  per unit in the prior year the decrease in the quarter was driven by net fair value losses which was primarily due to adjustments to valuation models in our core office and retail businesses to reflect future cash flows and generally – straight environment in the us bpy realized gains of  million in the quarter as we successfully closed on the previously announced sale of  interest in principal place office tower in london or amazon is the tenant as well as the sale of various assets within our opportunistic office multifamily triple net lease and industrial portfolios in the last  months weve realized gains of approximately  billion as we continue to execute our strategy of selling all our interests in assets where we feel we have maximized value these realized gains combined with our ffo this quarter provides strong support for our quarterly distribution of  per unit that was paid at the end of march in reviewing our q company ffo in a little more detail the main drivers that contributed to the  million yearoveryear growth were a legal settlement related to – earned in our london portfolio related to historic lease dispute of  million we had samestore growth of  and  in our core office and core retail businesses respectively in natural currency which increased net operating income by  million and although our retail business had some headwinds in the quarter due to tenant bankruptcies they continue to expect to achieve samestore growth between  and  for the year we had  million in ffo from additional capital invested in our opportunistic businesses where we benefited from our recent investment in ifc seoul we increased our ownership interest in rouse we grew our simply storage and our student housing portfolios and we closed on a significant investment in the manufactured housing sector in the us these pluses were partially offset by the impact of dispositions from our core office and retail platforms which reduced ffo by  million the impact of a major renovation project and easter holiday following in the first quarter last year which reduced earnings at atlantis on a comparable basis and the continued strength of the us dollar which reduced ffo earned from foreign currencies by  million we did not have any merchant build gains in our results in q and similar to last year due to differences in accounting rules we did not include in our earnings income recognized by ggp from the ala moana condominium development project which was  million at our share to date this income totaled  million at our share or  per bpy unit which we expect to recognize in our ifrs results over the balance of  in arriving at company ffo which we detail on page  of our supplemental amongst our standard adjustments for ggp warrants and the addback of depreciation of nonreal estate assets we adjusted for  million in transaction cost related to our recent acquisitions and  million for capitalized interest on active development projects that we now account for under the equity method due to recent sale of interest to third parties ifrs rules allow for a return on your share of equity invested in a development only if you consolidate that development and not on that same amount of equity if the development is accounted for under the equity method as a result we have adjusted our ffo to reflect a return consistent with our consolidated development projects and most importantly to be consistent with the return we recognized on these projects in prior periods in comparing our results to the fourth quarter of  the company ffo decreased by  million from  million earned in that period this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in ffo of  million in our core retail business due to seasonality and a net reduction in earnings from canary wharf where the  million development fee earned in the fourth quarter of last year exceeded the  million legal settlement that weve benefited from this quarter these minuses were partially offset by samestore increase in our opportunistic investment which improved ffo by  million largely driven by strong results from our hospitality business in north america and  million in interest expense savings due to lower average corporate debt balance on our proportionate balance sheet total assets increased to  billion as we completed the acquisition of a manufactured housing portfolio continued to fund our active development pipeline and benefited from the conversion of foreign currencies into more us dollars using spot rates at the end of the quarter these investments were funded in part through incremental asset level of debt with the balance from on hand liquidity including available credit facilities in cash raise from asset sales we continue to focus on reducing corporate level debt and pushing out maturities during the quarter we repaid cad million of senior unsecured bonds that were issued by our subsidiary bpo and we used available liquidity in addition we issued cad million of perpetual preferred shares at a rate of  using the proceeds to redeem an equal amount of our on demand capital securities in addition just subsequent to quarter end we were able to capitalize on a strong market and issued a further  million of perpetual preferred shares this time at a rate of  the proceeds from this issuance will be used to redeem the last of the on demand capital securities issued by our subsidiary bpo issuing preferred equity into the canadian market continues to be inaccessible on efficient means of raising capital to fund our growth lastly our board of directors yesterday declared a quarterly distribution of  per unit to be paid at the end of june so with that ill turn the call back over to you brian brian kingston thanks bryan our core office business had an active first quarter with several of our key operating markets reporting strong leasing notably new york city where we did almost  square feet denver and sydney where we had renewals in excess of  feet and toronto houston and boston in total we leased  million square feet of core office space in q at rents that we’re on average  higher than the leases that expiring during the period in addition to our existing operating portfolio the office developments that weve been constructing during the current building cycle are now beginning to deliver premier product to many of our key markets the volume of preleasing activity has been very encouraging in our two most active development markets london and new york city at a new york development manhattan west we signed whole foods to be the local destination food hall and grocer for the area as well as lunch leasing at the eugene our unit apartment building to very strong demand our leasing pipeline remains robust at five manhattan west and as well as the under construction one manhattan west activity and interest in this project is as strong as weve ever seen it in london amazon exercise its option to occupy the balance of the office space at principal place and will soon begin moving its employees into that building at a  bishopsgate which is our largest london development we signed law firm freshfields to a lease of more than  square feet with optionality to take an additional  square feet over the next two years in total we will deliver nearly  million square feet of new office development in the city of london  of which is already preleased moving to our us mall business despite the prevailing negative sentiment surrounding bricks and mortar retail our high quality portfolio continues to perform very well samestore lease percentage was  at quarter end and initial noi weighted rental rates for signed leases that commenced in the trailing  months on a sweet to sweet basis increased  when compared to the rental rate for expiring leases while certain retailers are experiencing challenges in adapting their business model to changing consumer tastes and the impact of ecommerce demand for high quality space in welllocated market dominant retail centers such as ours continues to be robust and this is reflected in ohio occupancy and leasing activity which totaled nearly  million square feet in the past  months as an example of this demand in the first quarter of  approximately  million square feet of space in our portfolio was impacted by retail tenant bankruptcies  of that space has already been released to retailers whose businesses continue to grow we also have a robust pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities within the portfolio which will yield very attractive rates of return and continue to drive above market earnings growth within our portfolio in short our retail business is doing extremely well in spite of what you may be seeing in the press we also noted comments from some analysts and media coming out of ggp’s conference call earlier this week that referenced the company being for sale and believe that some of managements comments have been taken out of context the board of ggp and bpy is a very significant shareholder our supportive of managements efforts to find ways to close the gap between their trading price and the underlying value of their assets and work with them to evaluate various alternatives and chart a path forward beyond that theres nothing else to report at this time so in conclusion we had a strong financial and operational quarter we continue to execute the business plan four to five balance sheet to make new strategic investment in order to generate higher returns for our unitholders so with those are planned remarks im now happy to open the line up to questions from analysts and investors operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of sheila mcgrath with evercore your line is open sheila mcgrath yes good morning brian you described the interest level in leasing in new york as robust in your letter and i was just wondering if you could talk about the trends there do you see more interest from in place tenants willing to move west to new office space and just give us an update on manhattan west the activity and tenant interest level there brian kingston sure i’m going to let ric talk about that generally in terms of what happening in new york ric clark hi sheila yes so we have experience of a market sort of a pretty meaningful pickup in overall activity and manhattan west in fact – we had four tenants competing for all available space at five manhattan west weve got leases out for every inch of availability there which is over  square feet and similarly were seeing a lot of competition for the remaining space that we have available in our north tower which is under development so we expect the next several months to be able to announce additional leasing there these tenants – most of them are coming from outside our portfolio and in total in new york we probably have a million square feet of leases in very serious negotiation stage for vacant space so were expecting a pretty good year on the leasing front in new york sheila mcgrath and then just keeping with the new york’s team on the investment sales side if you could describe the interest level at  park and if you are seeing continued interest from foreign investors or domestic investing in office in manhattan brian kingston yes theres still a lot of foreign interest theres been a lot of discussion about asian tenants not being in the market because of concerns about getting currency out of china that has not been our experience we had a good level of activity when we ran the sales process for  park avenue and it was coming from i guess all sort of walk public companies were very interested some private investors were interested in a lot of foreign capital as well as bryan mentioned we expect that transaction to close soon at pretty robust pricing so we havent seen an abatement in interest and assets maybe its not quite as broadly as a couple years ago but still very strong interest sheila mcgrath okay last one and then ill get back in the line just in london it looks like you had a lot of good leasing at some of your development and im just wondering just because everybody is worried about brexit and tenants leaving if you could comment on any known tenant departures or are you seeing any trends there with tenants wanting to exit upon expiration brian kingston no would be the quick answer part of that is because we generally have very longterm leases in place at canary wharf i dont think theres any expiries of any note for the next six years so we certainly dont have any tenants coming to talk about handing back leases or in advance of the lease expiry occasionally we read the same things as you would in the press about – some large tenants in london talking about what their plans maybe for the future but we havent really seen evidence that anybody is actually making those space decisions yet so i’d see the overall impact to date really from brexit has been a slowdown in decision making as tenants sort of wait to see how all this plays out as opposed to them having a particular view on where theyre going and obviously as you know our view in the longterm is london is going to remain a very important center of commerce and finance in particular it’s got great infrastructure great location and tax loss et cetera so we think in the fullness of time its going to be fine and were not really seeing any evidence of what you were referring to yet although there is a lot of discussion around the topic for sure sheila mcgrath okay thank you operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of mario saric with scotia capital your line is open mario saric thank you and good morning just wanted to circle back to the office discussion through looking at the us core office occupancy kind of fell bit quarteroverquarter  after pickup last quarter ric i was just wondering maybe if you can provide a bit commentary in terms of whether kind of the target mid occupancy for kind of early mid is still impact it sounds like you’ll contribute to that but i’m just wondering if there’s been any change in terms of where you think our core occupancy may end up ric clark so occupancy did dip by about  basis point through really sort of a couple of things that occurred during the quarter that contributed that one was we worked on early renewals with a couple of energy sector tenants one in denver one in houston and as part of that those renewals we took back a little bit of the space so that added to our vacancy not materially but a little bit we lost a law firm in downtown la for a little over  square feet again not material but the biggest contributor to that vacancy dip was the associated fresh lease expiring at five manhattan west we were able to do a new lease with them at  liberty street in lower manhattan and as i mentioned before leases out on every inch of available space at five manhattan west so the activity remains robust i think our projection for the year still remains that will increase overall occupancy by about  basis points and we dont see anything that jeopardizes that target at this point it still looks pretty good mario saric okay and that  basis point increase that’s relative to q  ric clark it’s probably relative yes mario saric okay is that for the entire portfolio or just for the core us portfolio ric clark that would be overall portfolio mario saric okay and then maybe just coming back to the uk and brian in your commentary there so given kind of your thoughts on the operating environment in london can you talk about potential quarter development leases that you maybe able to find over the next year or so and then based on where current valuations are in the various asset classes that you own do you expect to be a net buyer or seller in the uk over the next  months brian kingston yes especially as i mentioned we did sign the lease with freshfields at  bishopsgate which assuming they exercise all of their options and take the full amount of the space that they can under their lease but more about  lease there so that remaining  we have  months or so until construction completion weve got a good pipeline of leasing i expect the balance of that space is going to go to smaller tenants then weve been leasing two to date so single or a couple of floors at a time and generally theyre making their space planning decisions in the sort of  to  months at a time as opposed to some of the larger ones that where weve been able secure leases three or four years before the development completed so id say our leasing plan despite all of the noise around brexit et cetera is exactly on track what we would have thought which is to be at about  at this stage and feel pretty confident by the time we get to completion or shortly thereafter we should have the balance of thats basically stop and thats really all of the leasing that we have to do and in london as i mentioned amazon has taken up  of the office space at principal place and all of our other ones are so from a developer perspective were in great shape on leasing id say to your question about are we net buyer or a seller and in london we would love to grow the business there we like the market i think its going to be partly dependent on prices and we along like – along with a number of others were hopeful that maybe some of the disruption thats coming with brexit would create some opportunities to find some either deep value or even distressed opportunities we havent really seen them surface theres a lot of capital still in london pricing is very strong and so id say we prefer to buy but its really going to be dependent on whether we can find things that hit our return mario saric okay that’s good color maybe last question from more of a higher level question your capital recycling you done a really good job in terms of buying higher cap rate asset – lower cap rate assets and realize gains that you’re disclosing  billion over the past  months – testament to that the flipside of that is if we back code kind of the lease termination fees and whatnot the ffo for unit growth was fairly flat yearoveryear so i guess a two part question the first part being is there generally a time lag from a capital recycling perspective that could impact the ffo per unit in terms of realizing that incremental positive spread and then secondly when we think about the ffo per unit growth composition going forward should we think about the bigger part of that growth being some of these realized gain in settlements and whatnot that are kind of traditional customary core ffo deal brian kingston yes mario its brian ill just say on sort of yearoveryear basis sometimes there is a lag between when we raise capital and then ultimately can deploy it into other strategies that are higher return and so that will definitely impact our results a specific to q  versus the same period in  we did have growth that is kind of matched by the fact that our yearoveryear was  million which is exactly equals that at lease settlement but that growth was offset to some degree by  million of incremental fx headwinds related to the strength of the us dollar and similarly as the comment i mentioned about there falling in the first quarter of  that had a fairly sizable impact on our results when you compare it on a periodoverperiod basis so you back those things out theres  million to  million of incremental earnings that we had in q of  that i think a little bit lost in the numbers mario saric okay okay that’s helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark rothschild with canaccord your line is open mark rothschild thanks and good morning everyone you commented on ggp that maybe things were misunderstood coming out of their conference call though it appears that they were saying that they would like to look at different strategies to the surface value with their shares trading below nav bpys units are obviously trading well below nav as well and overall you have increased the unit buyback i was curious if this is something you would potentially increase further something we should expect to continue or if there are other options that you may consider at some point to improve the valuation relative to the nav brian kingston yes so i’d say all of those things are true so as weve sort of said in the past as one of the uses of proceeds from these asset sales of course is to buyback our units over the last couple of years weve been investing a significant portion of those proceeds into our building out our development pipeline and investing in our opportunistic strategy which we thought were the right – as well as reducing some corporate debt so we thought were the right place is a lot of that is now largely done the equity to go into our development is largely funded as these projects are now getting into the later stages of development as i mentioned on the opportunistic side were starting to have natural realizations out of that strategy that will fund them going forward and weve made a lot of progress on cleaning up all of the corporate debt so what that does it allows us to use to dedicate more of the proceeds toward buying back our own units and i think thats what youre starting to see the beginning of so as always will make the decisions at the time based on the various options that are available to us to invest in but we certainly have more flexibility today to use those proceeds to buyback stock and it certainly at the prices where were trading we think thats a great use of cash as far as considering other things that i think weve mentioned in the past some of the things that we been thinking about whether its reconversion or other things i think we spend a fair bit of time considering whether this things we can do to either simplify the story do a better job marketing to investors that we think will have an interest in the story that maybe arent investing in it and i think bryan and i will continue on doing that but i wouldnt expect any major strategy shift we think to really continue what weve been talking about the last three years mark rothschild okay and you have indicated that there would be some more asset sales should we expect any other large office sales like the one youre doing on park avenue in  bryan davis yes potentially i would say we said were targeting  billion to  billion of net equity  park is  million of that number in the balance will be a combination maybe one or two other large things as well as some smaller portfolios or assets here and there and then just potentially to be one more mark rothschild and then just lastly if you pretty much funded much of the development and evaluation is what we expect more of the proceeds to go to unit buyback versus acquisitions or will you still be focused on external growth bryan davis it will be both i think when were making these external acquisitions as we are through the opportunistic strategy we think these are  plus irr transactions which are obviously very attractive so i think it so long as we continue to find those and weve got a pretty good pipeline of those types of acquisitions we will put some of our capital toward that but as i mentioned we now have a bit more flexibility to put more toward the buyback if we stay down here mark rothschild okay got it thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of sheila mcgrath with evercore your line is open sheila mcgrath yes bryan may be you could just give us a sense of how much capital you need or equity need on the remaining development and i think at the beginning of the year you said you would sell or try to source  billion to  billion of equity and is that  does that still stand im just trying to get a sense of sources and uses for the year bryan davis yes the  billion to  billion of equity proceeds is still the plan for the year in terms of asset sales and the amount of equity that will come out of those we think for funding of development its probably in the order of  million to  million needed for that and then the balance would go to some combination of new investments investing and whether thats new investments or acquisitions or otherwise funding development or redevelopment and so not necessarily ground up development but investing in things like place here as well as the buyback sheila mcgrath okay and then could you give us a little more detail on san francisco acquisition of one – i think it was one post just terms of pricing and how that came about to that opportunity brian kingston yes so look it was a – this was an occupier owned building there was a process around the sale so they hired brokers we participated in it and essentially the transaction is to buy the building from them lease it back to them portion of it on a longterm basis and a portion on a shorter term one so theyre trying to shrink their own footprint within it and id say one of the key things on this transaction why they got comfortable with us was its a tenant that we do – within other places and they felt comfortable that we be a longterm owners the building require some capital around the lobby and refurbishing the floors et cetera we think obviously because it was a marketed process we have to sell at fair price but we do think this is one where the seller had the unique interest in who is going to own the building afterwards as opposed to whether the check would clear and we think that sort of help distinguish us among the pool this was bought as part of our core plus strategy which we recently launched last year that funded strategy is targeting  to  levered returns and us that we sort of fit into that profile sheila mcgrath okay and then just strategically in terms of property sectors obviously office and retail are main core and in the past you’ve mentioned growing multifamily away from the fund business are you focused on growing that business on balance sheet and any other sectors that you think you would be looking at on balance sheet away from the funds brian kingston yes id say that the distinction maybe is in the funds on multifamily to date a lot of our investments have been suburban garden style apartments and the strategy oftentimes was buy it fix it sell it and these were assets that were maybe under invested in and needed some repositioning the strategy youre referring to in terms of growing and growing on the balance sheet in particular and outside of the funds is much more focused on building a multifamily business similar to our office building business being in major gateway cities in urban locations generally highrise much higher value assets where youve got a lot more density look we continue to do that weve got a number of developments underway right now in manhattan and weve got sites available to us in los angeles and a few other major markets around the united states were also looking outside of the us at this were building assets like this on canary wharf i think this will be a meaningful part of the business going forward given where pricing is right now our focus has been on developed to hold because we think the returns are better there we can develop to a lower price and more often these assets are trading through replacement cost so thats really been the focus but i think it’s an opportunity came along to buy for good value of a larger portfolio wed look to do that and then as far as your second question other sectors that we’re looking to build on the balance sheet we continue to like logistics as a sector longerterm i think pricing there are similar to multifamily right now it’s a little bit challenging to invest in scale so weve done a few smaller things there but i think over time thats another area you could see become a larger portion of our core balance sheet sheila mcgrath okay and then last question on the eugene how is the reception so far if you could just give us a little bit of update there brian kingston sheila so just a couple of quick data points on the eugene we open for leasing march  and march was a bit of a slow month largely weather related i think we released  units in march we release  in april and we’ve released  todate so we’re well above our pro forma pace of  to  units a month and overall things are going really well were getting the economics that we thought so sheila mcgrath great thank you brian kingston okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mario saric with scotiabank your line is open mario saric hi thank you just one quick followup just on the back of that  billion to  billion target net equity sales for the year  park brian as you mentioned is part of that that has been reported that youre looking at a partial sale of brookfield place new york which if you do the math would take a big part of the remainder i was just wondering if you may provide a good color in terms of what your plans are there and the potential level of interest in downtown new york versus which gives a  park brian kingston yes that is potentially one that we could look at it id say in terms of interest in lower manhattan and ric could probably comment on this better than i can but id say interest is never been higher in this sub market and rents are strong down here people are sort of seeing the transformation that happens so we do think investor interest in an asset like this particularly one that’s been fully repositioned and is now least would be high i think weve got a couple of options available to us as we think about that  billion to  billion obviously weve got a lot more than that in a potential pipeline and so thats possibly one of the assets i think part of that will just be assessing the pricing we can get on that and some of the upside that you maybe foregoing by selling it here versus things we can do elsewhere so ric clark yes i dont have a whole lot to add i just would say that brookfield place new york has turned out to be one of the best assets in the world so there is a lot of interest people would be interested in and holding in for a long period of time as what we – but as brian said at the right price will bring partners into the asset if not will work on other things to fill the rest of that  billion number mario saric okay thats great thank you ric clark okay end of qa operator there are no further questions at this time mr brian kingston i will turn the call back over to you brian kingston okay thank you everyone for dialing in and we look forward to updating you
