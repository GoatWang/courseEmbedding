boomer generation in the asian markets we are in the initial stages of opening a travel agency in taiwan republic of china on may   we obtained a license from the investment commission ministry of economic affairs taiwan roc to invest into taiwan through our whollyowned subsidiary green forest management consulting inc a taiwan roc company we anticipate that we will be able to obtain this approval by the end of  the challenges we anticipate in obtaining the necessary approvals to operate a travel agency in taiwan as well as in other countries primarily involves meeting the statutory requirements related to capital requirements statutory reserves and employing fit proper and qualified management these challenges have already been addressed by starting our business in taiwan as referenced in risk factors under government approval we expect to begin generating revenue in taiwan in april  after we obtain the relevant licenses and approval from taiwans government our travel services entity in taiwan will provide both outbound travel services for customers based in taiwan and inbound travel services for customers based abroad and coming to taiwan both the outbound and inbound services will be conducted in our taiwan office except the inbound services will rely in part on advertising conducted or directed outside of taiwan we will not only book airplane tickets hotels and tours but design specialized destinationrelated travel services for our customers based on their specific needs and desires while they are in taiwan in this way our market will consist of both those potential travelers based in taiwan but also anyone from any other country who might be planning a trip to taiwan or need assistance with designing a travel itinerary once they arrive in taiwan we will market our products and services to the travel population in taiwan and abroad through our website wwwsanlotusholdingcom as well as through services such as twitter and other media outlets we have purchased three vehicles to provide transportation to our customers while they are in california a common destination for taiwan business travelers and tourists we intend to use the cars with hired drivers to provide car service for our customers from the airport to their hotels or other desired destinations upon their arrival in california providing car service is an experimental project at this point as we only have three vehicles available for use we will charge our customers an amount that will cover our expenses in providing the car and driver in the event the service is popular and appears to benefit our services we may add to the service in the future at which time we would reevaluate the amount we charge for the service in addition to developing our business in taiwan in the first quarter of  we entered into nonbinding letters of intent to acquire existing travel services agencies in taipei city taiwan hong kong vietnam vancouver british columbia and california we plan to proceed in negotiating terms for these acquisitions over the course of the next several months while we simultaneously gather operational data from our module operation in

intend to use to develop destinationrelated travel services we expect to complete the acquisitions of such land andor land holding companies by the end of  despite of entering the nonbinding letters of intent to acquire the travel agencies and land we remain in the preliminary discussion with the travel agencies and the sellers of the land about the specific considerations to acquire them thus to date we are not able to estimate any specific costs in completing such acquisitions acquiring the travel agencies located both within and outside of taiwan and land in taiwan is an ongoing effort that will continue during the life of the company to facilitate our acquisition efforts we will actively seeking additional funding on favorable terms to continue our acquisition if additional funding is not available on acceptable terms we may not be able to implement our acquisitions and continue our operations we plan to be funded by private placement of our equity securities andor mortgage our land but there can be no assurance we will be funded as such thus there can be no assurance we will successfully complete our acquisitions of travel agencies andor land if we fail to complete our acquisitions of travel agencies andor land we may be forced to cease our operation entirely and you may lose all your investment each of these nonbinding letters of intent above was disclosed to the sec in a current report on form k shortly after our entry into each such nonbinding letter of intent regarding the development of our travel services entity in taiwan our plan is to build up a

definitive dates in applying for obtaining statutory approval to operate travel agencies beyond taiwan roc we anticipate that after one full year of operation we will have sufficient data to construct an expansion plan for establishing ventures beyond taiwan products and services offered  transportation airlines  buses  car rentals  railways  cruises  accommodation hotels  resorts  cruises and  packaged holidays  local tours our business strategy is to generate revenue mainly through commissions or markups for selling travel products for example for airplane tickets for which we do not take inventory we will receive commission revenue from the airlines as compensation for selling airplane tickets to our customers in other words our revenue will not come directly from the payments which the customers make to the airlines but instead our commission revenue will be paid by the product provider eg airlines directly to our company the size of commission will vary from product to product depending on how product providers eg airlines set their distribution strategy below is an estimate of the commission percentage we expect to be able to obtain for each type of product type of product estimated commission  transportation    accommodation    packaged tours    another type of revenue would come from markups our markup revenue will be earned when we choose to take inventory on products such as hotel stays cruise trips or tours this type of revenue is different from commissionbased revenue in that we will secure the product outright before customers purchase the product after we purchase the product we would then sell the product to the customer at a higher price thereby earning the difference or markup as profit the size of the markup will vary depending on our inventory level market conditions and customer preference below is an estimate of the markup percentage and the initial cost of obtaining wholesale inventory for each type of product type of product estimated markup  initial cost of obtaining wholesale inventory transportation     accommodation     packaged tours     we expect to incur the cost of obtaining wholesale inventory as soon as our license to operate a travel agency has been granted consequently we will recover the cost and make a profit when inventory is turned over or sold the profitability of our markup business will depend on how frequent inventory is turned we anticipate providing other ancillary travel services such as submitting visa applications on behalf of clients it is our understanding that it is customary to charge a handling fee of us for the submission of a visa application these types of services however should only constitute a small part of our overall revenue we plan to market our company to highincome individuals and affinity groups such as private schools alumni groups and wealth management organizations at banks and investment firms our plan to reach these target customers is through seeking lists from the affinity groups and marketing online in terms of seeking lists from affinity groups our strategy involves no upfront cost to our company we will instead share the profits with the organizations that provided such lists when customers purchase travel products through our company our general rule of thumb is to share  of the profit with the affinity group this estimate may be adjusted upward or downward depending on the size and quality of the customer list separately we plan to market our company online through our company website currently under construction our company website wwwsanlotusholdingcom will be a vehicle to promote our offerings to a wide audience we plan on interacting with our retail customers primarily through our website our customers will be able to place their purchases via the telephone through credit card or bank transfer payment business development the company seeks to develop mutually beneficial business relationships with travel product providers such as airlines hotels and tour operators and will begin offering travel products to our customers the company will work on reaching a variety of affinity groups and reaching agreements to service their customers the company recently launched a website wwwsanlotusholdingcom to begin marketing our services online our costs as a reporting company in our first year are approximately  in legal fees and  in auditing fees including the preparation of our k filing and annual audit and our costs as a reporting company in our second year are approximately  in legal fees and  in auditing fees including the preparation of our k filing and annual audit marketing and sales our initial marketing efforts will be designed to drive prospective clients to our website wwwsanlotusholdingcom we plan to use social media vehicles such as twitter and facebook to generate awareness of our website we expect to engage prospective clients through promoting our website and responding to requests for information eventually we expect to use broaderbased email marketing to generate a much larger number of sales leads that will be followed up with a personal exchange via email or telephone but there is no guarantee this will be successful we have taken the following steps in implementing our business plan vendor discussion and supplier agreements we have contacted vendors to provide travel related products to our customers below is a summary of the number of vendors who have responded favorably to our request we have not signed any formal supplier agreements with product vendors type of vendor number of vendor airline  bus company  cruise company  hotel  resort  website development we have completed the initial version of our website wwwsanlotusholdingcom and will use this site to market our services to the general public affinity groups we have used the contacts of our directors and officers in initially contacting various affinity groups thus far we have had conversations with no less than five groups that have expressed interest in sharing their group list with our company however at this time we have not executed any of agreements with these companies below is a summary of the statistics we wish to reach regarding various affinity groups type of vendor number of vendor airline  bus company  cruise company  hotel  resort  we are in the process of applying for our license to operate a travel agency in taiwan we expect to receive approval for our business license by the end of  once proper licenses and approvals have been granted we will need to take the following steps in generating revenue  formally launch online operations in or after   sign formal supplier agreements with product vendors that have expressed interest previously in or after   sign on additional product vendors in or after   sign profit sharing agreements with affinity groups that have expressed interest previously completed as of the year   sign on additional affinity groups in or after   hire office staff in or after  these steps will ensure that we have sufficient product and service offerings to attract customers both to launch our operations and on an ongoing basis going forward in addition to the aforementioned steps we are in the process of investing in and developing scenicdestination real estate sites through the acquisition of land and land holding companies we acquired certain land and canceled certain land transactions in taiwan roc which is specifically described in item  of our annual report on form k filed on march   as amended by the form ka filed on march   we expect the destination real estate portion of our business to make up approximately half of our overall business in the future with the other half consisting of travel agencies by destination real estate we mean to develop locations that will attract and support visitors for stays of one day or longer providing outdoor activities and places of interest for visitors from both domestic locales and abroad in addition to our destination real estate business we are continuing to develop our travel agency in taiwan and have entered into certain nonbinding letters of intent to acquire travel agencies located outside of taiwan in both asia and north america we aim to complete the acquisition of five travel agencies by the end of  we intend to fund all of these acquisitions through the sale of our common stock while this will cause dilution to the existing shareholders we do not believe this dilution will negatively affect the shareholders as the acquisitions will add significant value to the company and will allow the company to proceed in developing its business we may also from time to time invest in travelrelated service providers that we believe can help us better service our customers and help them meet their travel needs through investing in such entities we may be able to recoup some of our costs through maintaining small ownership interests in the entities our clients use furthermore by investing in these entities we may be able to work with them to better improve their travel offerings or related services or bring the entities up to the standard of service our customers expect we recently made one such investment in a peace world holding inc apw a company in the early stages of developing destination real estate products and services we expect that apw based on its expressed business plans will develop destination real estate that our customers will be interested in traveling to thus enhancing the products and services we can provide to our customers any costs involved in offering such products and services to our customers if there are any such costs will be incorporated into the fees we charge our customers for our service at this time we have no further plans for making any additional such investments and therefore have no plans of making further capital expenditures in relation to such investments competition we will be operating in two sectors  in the area of destination real estate development and travel agencies these two sectors will complement each other as over the long term the travel agencies will be able to refer clients and visitors to our destination real estate sites we will face competition from many individuals and companies that also market travel locations and products as concerns travel destinations we desire to utilize scenic properties that will allow for outdoor activities thus we must create locations that provide both activities of interest and provide convenience and amenities while allowing visitors to enjoy the natural beauty of the area around them observation tells us that the current travel industry is generally driven by the lowest cost provider however different segments of the market such as the affluent segment consider factors beyond cost when they plan vacations and travel ahead of cost an affluent consumer may value factors such as convenience comprehensive service and luxury andor prestige to name a few we believe that a successful marketing effort to reach the affluent market segment retiring baby boomers with the right quality of products should increase our revenue opportunity in taiwan market conditions for the travel industry are similar to those of the us there is a mix of large travel agencies online service providers and smallscale local operators however since taiwan is geographically much smaller than the us competition is fierce in taiwan there are four types of travel agencies  mega agencies a lion travel b cola tour c ez travel  intermediatesmall  locally or regionally owned agencies a star travel b set tour  independent agencies usually catering to a special or niche market a royal jet way b perfect travel c life tour  airline  other types of travel consolidators a china airlines b eva airlines c american express we feel at this time we would fall into the independent agency category and hope to create our own niche as a more customeroriented agency or travel service provider with a reputation of going the extra mile wherever possible in connecting the right type of customers with the right type of products concerning destination real estate sites there are many competitors who will be vying for the business of our potential clientele the key will be to develop attractive properties that provide the amenities and activities that visitors would enjoy in our development plans we are defining destination real estate as locations that will draw tourist from both domestically and abroad to visit our sites for a period of one or two days or more so in the long term we will be developing sites that include hotels restaurants as well as activity and entertainment centers among other things some of our competitors in the destination real estate sector in taiwan include the following companies elements innovation co ltd e united group taiwan land development inc emerging growth company status

management consulting inc a taiwan company the company has not conducted business operations nor had revenues from operations since its inception the company’s business plan is to desig and market global travel packages and affinity travel excursions through out the world and develop a global travel and leisure agency business the company through its recent acquisition is engaged in the provision of travel services including hotel reservation services airline ticketing and travel package in the united states the company’s yearend is december    basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap”   consolidation policy the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of san lotus holding inc and its subsidiaries intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation   going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business as shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the company had an accumulated deficit of  as of june   the company faces all the risks common to companies at the development stage including capitalization and uncertainty of funding sources high initial expenditure levels uncertain revenue streams and difficulties in managing growth the companys losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern the companys consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty the company is currently addressing its liquidity issue by continually seeking investment capital through private placements of common stock and debt the company believes its current and future plans enable it to continue as a going concern the companys ability to achieve these objectives cannot be determined at this time these consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments which would be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities other than the normal course of business and at amounts which may differ from those in the accompanying consolidated financial statements   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   revenue recognition the company’s revenues are principally derived from providing hotel reservation air ticketing other travel and nontravel services the company recognizes revenues when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of arrangement with the customer services have been performed fees are fixed or determinable and collectability of the fees is reasonably assured as prescribed by asc   revenue recognition overall  these criteria as related to revenues are considered to have been met as follows packagedtour the company receives referral fees from travel product providers for packaged tour products and services through its service platform and branch offices referral fees are recognized as commissions on a net basis after the packagedtour service are rendered and collections are reasonably assured  in case s where these entities undertake the majority of the business risks and acts as principal related to the travel tour services provided revenues are recognized at gross amounts received from customers after the services are rendered loss due to obligations from cancelled travel services of such principal arrangement is minimal in the past air ticketing services commissions from air ticketing services rendered are recognized upon the issuance of air tickets net of estimated cancellations customers purchase the air tickets and the company remits the net amount less base commission to the airlines estimated cancellations were insignificant for the years ended june   the company presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss as the company acts as an agent does not assume any inventory risk and has no obligations for cancelled airline ticket reservations the company sometimes also receives additional discretionary commissions from certain airlines when performance targets are met such discretionary commissions are recognized on a cash basis because the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or timing of receipt of such commissions in advance other travel services other travel services are mainly commissions from insurance companies for the sale of travel insurance customers purchase the travel insurance and the company remits the net amount less commission to the insurance companies the company recognizes revenue when the travel insurance is issued to the customer net of estimated cancellations   cash and cash equivalents cash and

computation of the diluted loss per share if their effect would be antidilutive for the year ended june    the company did not have any common equivalent shares   impairment of longlived assets the company has adopted accounting standards codification subtopic  property plant and equipment “asc ” asc  requires that longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions recurring losses or a forecasted inability to achieve breakeven operating results over an extended period the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows should impairment in value be indicated the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset asc  also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell management has determined that no impairments of longlived assets currently exist   goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired the company follows asc subtopic   intangiblesgoodwill and other goodwill  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist the company performs its annual impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in december of each year the company adopted asu   testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment  which amends the guidance in asc subtopic  on testing indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment asu  provides an entity testing an indefinitelived intangible asset for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset although asu  revises the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider in interim periods it does not revise the requirements to test indefinitelived intangible assets  annually for impairment and  between annual tests if there is a change in events or circumstances if the company determines on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets is more likely than not less than the carrying amount further testing is required under the further testing the impairment test on indefinitelived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess assets with definite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straightline method over the estimated economic life   income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes which requires that the company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reversedeferred income tax benefit expense results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities a valuation allowance is recorded

to  market travel products and services to the growing baby boomer market with an initial focus on the asian market via developing and operating a global travel and leisure agency business and  jointly develop the tourism and travel of he ping zhen  shaowu    city fujian province china with he ping zhen development ltd a china limited corporation  the specific plans of which remains under preliminary discussion our vision is to consolidate travel products and services and deliver value to the worlds travel population  w e changed our state of incorporation from the state of nevada to the state of california the conversion on july         we are a development stage company that plans to market global travel products to the retiring baby boomer generation in the asian markets we are in the initial stages of opening a travel agency in taiwan republic of china on may   we obtained a license from the investment commission ministry of economic affairs taiwan roc to invest into taiwan through our whollyowned subsidiary green forest management consulting inc a taiwan roc company we anticipate that we will be able to obtain this approval by the end of  the challenges we anticipate in obtaining the necessary approvals to operate a travel agency in taiwan as well as in other countries primarily involves meeting the statutory requirements related to capital requirements statutory reserves and employing fit proper and qualified management these challenges have already been addressed by starting our business in taiwan as referenced in risk factors under government approval we expect to begin generating revenue in taiwan in april  after we obtain the relevant licenses and approval from taiwans government     our travel services entity in taiwan will provide both outbound travel services for customers based in taiwan and inbound travel services for customers based abroad and coming to taiwan both the outbound and inbound services will be conducted in our taiwan office except the inbound services will rely in part on advertising conducted or directed outside of taiwan     we will not only book airplane tickets hotels and tours but design specialized destinationrelated travel services for our customers based on their specific needs and desires while they are in taiwan in this way our market will consist of both those potential travelers based in taiwan but also anyone from any other country who might be planning a trip to taiwan or need assistance with designing a travel itinerary once they arrive in taiwan we will market our products and services to the travel population in taiwan and abroad through our website wwwsanlotusholdingcom  as well as through services such as twitter and other media outlets we have purchased three vehicles to provide transportation to our customers while they are in california a common destination for taiwan business travelers and tourists     we intend to use the cars with hired drivers to provide car service for our customers from the airport to their hotels or other desired destinations upon their arrival in california providing car service is an experimental project at this point as we only have three vehicles available for use we will charge our customers an amount that will cover our expenses in providing the car and driver in the event the service is popular and appears to benefit our services we may add to the service in the future at which time we would reevaluate the amount we charge for the service                        in addition to developing our business in taiwan in the first quarter of  we entered into nonbinding letters of intent to acquire existing travel services agencies in taipei city taiwan hong kong vietnam vancouver british columbia and california we plan to proceed in negotiating terms for these acquisitions over the course of the next several months while we simultaneously gather operational data from our module operation in taiwan we expect to complete the acquisitions of such travel agencies by the end of  at the same time we also have entered into nonbinding letters of intent to acquire land in taiwan which land we intend to use to develop destinationrelated travel services we expect to complete the acquisitions of such land andor land holding companies by the end of      despite of entering the nonbinding letters of intent to acquire the travel agencies and land we remain in the preliminary discussion with the travel agencies and the sellers of the land about the specific considerations to acquire them thus to date we are not able to estimate any specific costs in completing such acquisitions acquiring the travel agencies located both within and outside of taiwan and land in taiwan is an ongoing effort that will continue during the life of the company to facilitate our acquisition efforts we will actively seeking additional funding on favorable terms to continue our acquisition if additional funding is not available on acceptable terms we may not be able to implement our acquisitions and continue our operations we plan to be funded by private placement of our equity securities andor mortgage our land but there can be no assurance we will be funded as such thus there can be no assurance we will successfully complete our acquisitions of travel agencies andor land if we fail to complete our acquisitions of travel agencies andor land we may be forced to cease our operation entirely and you may lose all your investment     each of these nonbinding letters of intent above was disclosed to the sec in a current report on form k shortly after our entry into each such nonbinding letter of intent     regarding the development of our travel services entity in taiwan our plan is to build up a successful module operation in taiwan and to gain meaningful operational data for one year before using it as a model to replicate throughout asia it is critically important for us to obtain credible data in terms of the following per module main office plus branch officers            startup cost     a         capital requirements  estimated  upon application license  end of      b         statutory reserve  estimated  upon approval of license  end of      c           fees  estimated  upon application for license  end of        d         rent deposit  estimated  upon rental of office  end of      e

         operating expenses     a         number of employees and salary per office  two employees at  each per month for a total of   starting in april      b         office rentgreen forest per monthstarting in september      c           office rentda ren per month starting in september      d         telecommunications   per monthstarting in june  and  starting in september      e          utilities etc   per month starting in september      f          advertising  estimated  for initial television advertising development  end of      g         condominium expenses  per monthstarting in

cash flow         breakeven point and projected earnings     making projections using real figures based on the module operations should lower our level of risk as we expand into other countries while it is premature to set any definitive dates in applying for obtaining statutory approval to operate travel agencies beyond taiwan roc we anticipate that after one full year of operation we will have sufficient data to construct an expansion plan for establishing ventures beyond taiwan                    products and services offered                  transportation airlines  buses  car rentals  railways  cruises                  accommodation hotels  resorts  cruises and                 packaged holidays  local tours     our business strategy is to generate revenue mainly through commissions or markups for selling travel products for example for airplane tickets for which we do not take inventory we will receive commission revenue from the airlines as compensation for selling airplane tickets to our customers in other words our revenue will not come directly from the payments which the customers make to the airlines but instead our commission revenue will be paid by the product provider eg airlines directly to our company the size of commission will vary from product to product depending on how product providers eg airlines set their distribution strategy below is an estimate of the commission percentage we expect to be able to obtain for each type of product     type of product estimated commission  transportation    accommodation    packaged tours        another type of revenue would come from markups our markup revenue will be earned when we choose to take inventory on products such as hotel stays cruise trips or tours this type of revenue is different from commissionbased revenue in that we will secure the product outright before customers purchase the product after we purchase the product we would then sell the product to the customer at a higher price thereby earning the difference or markup as profit the size of the markup will vary depending on our inventory level market conditions and customer preference     below is an estimate of the markup percentage and the initial cost of obtaining wholesale inventory for each type of product     type of product estimated markup  initial cost of obtaining wholesale inventory transportation     accommodation     packaged tours         we expect to incur the cost of obtaining wholesale inventory as soon as our license to operate a travel agency has been granted consequently we will recover the cost and make a profit when inventory is turned over or sold the profitability of our markup business will depend on how frequent inventory is turned     we anticipate providing other ancillary travel services such as submitting visa applications on behalf of clients it is our understanding that it is customary to charge a handling fee of us for the submission of a visa application these types of services however should only constitute a small part of our overall revenue     we plan to market our company to highincome individuals and affinity groups such as private schools alumni groups and wealth management organizations at banks and investment firms our plan to reach these target customers is through seeking lists from the affinity groups and marketing online in terms of seeking lists from affinity groups our strategy involves no upfront cost to our company we will instead share the profits with the organizations that provided such lists when customers purchase travel products through our company our general rule of thumb is to share  of the profit with the affinity group this estimate may be adjusted upward or downward depending on the size and quality of the customer list separately we plan to market our company online through our company website currently under construction our company website wwwsanlotusholdingcom will be a vehicle to promote our offerings to a wide audience we plan on interacting with our retail customers primarily through our website our customers will be able to place their purchases via the telephone through credit card or bank transfer payment                        business development     the company seeks to develop mutually beneficial business relationships with travel product providers such as airlines hotels and tour operators and will begin offering travel products to our customers the company will work on reaching a variety of affinity groups and reaching agreements to service their customers the company recently launched a website wwwsanlotusholdingcom to begin marketing our services online our costs as a reporting company in our first year are approximately  in legal fees and  in auditing fees including the preparation of our k filing and annual audit and our costs as a reporting company in our second year are approximately  in legal fees and  in auditing fees including the preparation of our k filing and annual audit     marketing and sales     our initial marketing efforts will be designed to drive prospective clients to our website wwwsanlotusholdingcom we plan to use social media vehicles such as twitter and facebook to generate awareness of our website we expect to engage prospective clients through promoting our website and responding to requests for information eventually we expect to use broaderbased email marketing to generate a much larger number of sales leads that will be followed up with a personal exchange via email or telephone but there is no guarantee this will be successful     we have taken the following steps in implementing our business plan     vendor discussion and supplier agreements     we have contacted vendors to provide travel related products to our customers below is a summary of the number of vendors who have responded favorably to our request we have not signed any formal supplier agreements with product vendors     type of vendor number of vendor airline  bus company  cruise company  hotel  resort  other travel agency      website development     we have completed the initial version of our website wwwsanlotusholdingcom and will use this site to market our services to the general public     affinity groups     we have used the contacts of our directors and officers in initially contacting various affinity groups thus far we have had conversations with no less than five groups that have expressed interest in sharing their group list with our company however at this time we have not executed any of agreements with these companies below is a summary of the statistics we wish to reach regarding various affinity groups     type of vendor number of vendor airline  bus company  cruise company  hotel  resort  other travel agency                         we are in the process of applying for our license to operate a travel agency in taiwan we expect to receive approval for our business license by the end of  once proper licenses and approvals have been granted we will need to take the following steps in generating revenue               formally launch online operations in or after                sign formal supplier agreements with product vendors that have expressed interest previously in or after                sign on additional product vendors in or after                sign profit sharing agreements with affinity groups that have expressed interest previously completed as of the year                sign on additional affinity groups in or after                hire office staff in or after      these steps will ensure that we have sufficient product and service offerings to attract customers both to launch our operations and on an ongoing basis going forward     in addition to the aforementioned steps we are in the process of investing in and developing scenicdestination real estate sites through the acquisition of land and land holding companies we acquired certain land and canceled certain land transactions in taiwan roc which is specifically described in item  of our annual report on form k filed on march    as amended by the form ka filed on march          we expect the destination real estate portion of our business to make up approximately half of our overall business in the future with the other half consisting of travel agencies by destination real estate we mean to develop locations that will attract and support visitors for stays of one day or longer providing outdoor activities and places of interest for visitors from both domestic locales and abroad in addition to our destination real estate business we are continuing to develop our travel agency in taiwan and have entered into certain nonbinding letters of intent to acquire travel agencies located outside of taiwan in both asia and north america we aim to complete the acquisition of five travel   agencies by the end of  we intend to fund all of these acquisitions through the sale of our common stock while this will cause dilution to the existing shareholders we do not believe this dilution will negatively affect the shareholders as the acquisitions will add significant value to the company and will allow the company to proceed in developing its business     we may also from time to time invest in travelrelated service providers that we believe can help us better service our customers and help them meet their travel needs through investing in such entities we may be able to recoup some of our costs through maintaining small ownership interests in the entities our clients use furthermore by investing in these entities we may be able to work with them to better improve their travel offerings or related services or bring the entities up to the standard of service our customers expect we recently made one such investment in a peace world holding inc apw a company in the early stages of developing destination real estate products and services we expect that apw based on its expressed business plans will develop destination real estate that our customers will be interested in traveling to thus enhancing the products and services we can provide to our customers any costs involved in offering such products and services to our customers if there are any such costs will be incorporated into the fees we charge our customers for our service at this time we have no further plans for making any additional such investments and therefore have no plans of making further capital expenditures in relation to such investments                         competition     we will be operating in two sectors  in the area of destination real estate development and travel agencies these two sectors will complement each other as over the long term the travel agencies will be able to refer clients and visitors to our destination real estate sites we will face competition from many individuals and companies that also market travel locations and products as concerns travel destinations we desire to utilize scenic properties that will allow for outdoor activities thus we must create locations that provide both activities of interest and provide convenience and amenities while allowing visitors to enjoy the natural beauty of the area around them                        observation tells us that the current travel industry is generally driven by the lowest cost provider however different segments of the market such as the affluent segment consider factors beyond cost when they plan vacations and travel ahead of cost an affluent consumer may value factors such as convenience comprehensive service and luxury andor prestige to name a few we believe that a successful marketing effort to reach the affluent market segment retiring baby boomers with the right quality of products should increase our revenue opportunity in taiwan market conditions for the travel industry are similar to those of the us there is a mix of large travel agencies online service providers and smallscale local operators however since taiwan is geographically much smaller than the us competition is fierce     in taiwan there are four types of travel agencies            mega agencies     a         lion travel     b         cola tour     c         ez travel            intermediatesmall  locally or regionally owned agencies     a         star travel     b         set tour            independent agencies usually catering to a special or niche market     a         royal jet way     b         perfect travel     c         life tour            airline  other types of travel consolidators     a         china airlines     b         eva airlines     c         american express     we feel at this time we would fall into the independent agency category and hope to create our own niche as a more customeroriented agency or travel service provider with a reputation of going the extra mile wherever possible in connecting the right type of customers with the right type of products     concerning destination real estate sites there are many competitors who will be vying for the business of our potential clientele the key will be to develop attractive properties that provide the amenities and activities that visitors would enjoy in our development plans we are defining destination real estate as locations that will draw tourist from both domestically and abroad to visit our sites for a period of one or two days or more so in the long term we will be developing sites that include hotels restaurants as well as activity and entertainment centers among other things some of our competitors in the destination real estate sector in taiwan include the following companies                        elements innovation co ltd e united group taiwan land development inc     emerging growth company status we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jumpstart our business startups act the jobs act as a result we are

advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards     we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b

our planned acquisitions we will need to generate sufficient revenues or require additional funding through the private placement of our equity securities andor mortgage our land but there can be no

subsidiary da ren international development inc and  cash held by our whollyowned california subsidiary xo experience inc for purposes of building our travel services business in taiwan     based upon the above we believe that mao ren international inc will not have enough funds to support themselves for remaining months we will likely to seek additional funding through the private placement of our equity securities andor mortgage our land but there can be no assurance we will be funded as such and there can be no assurance that our existing shareholders will provide us with additional capital     as to our planned acquisitions although the nonbinding letters of intent to acquire the travel agencies were entered we remain in the preliminary discussion with them about the specific considerations to acquire each of them thus to date we are not able to estimate any specific costs in completing such acquisitions additionally except for the completed acquisitions of da ren international development inc we remain in the preliminary discussion about the specific consideration in acquiring other land or land holding companies thus to date we are not able to estimate any specific costs in completing the acquisitions other than the completed acquisitions     if we require additional funding to complete our planned acquisitions we will actively seeking additional

management conducted its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our chief executive officer based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of june   due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is described below     management identified significant deficiencies related to i the lack of us gaap expertise of our chief financial officer ii the lack of us gaap expertise of our internal accounting staff and iii the
