interest expense net of interest income plus income tax expense and plus depreciation and amortization ebitda as adjusted for i the amortization of prepaid royalty payments recorded in conjunction with a settlement of a dispute with our former owner ii contributions to arizona school tuition organizations in lieu of the payment of state income taxes iii sharebased compensation and iv onetime unusual charges or gains such as litigation and regulatory reserves impairment charges and asset writeoffs and exit or lease termination costs we present adjusted ebitda because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our operating performance  we also make certain compensation decisions based in part on our operating performance as measured by adjusted ebitda and our loan agreement requires us to comply with covenants that include performance metrics substantially similar to adjusted ebitda  all of the adjustments made in our calculation of adjusted ebitda are adjustments to items that management does not consider to be reflective of our core operating performance management considers our core operating performance to be that which can be affected by our managers in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations during that period and does not consider the items for which we make adjustments as listed above to be reflective of our core performance we believe adjusted ebitda allows us to compare our current operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry because it does not give effect to potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting relative interest expense including the impact of writeoffs of deferred financing costs when companies refinance their indebtedness tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses the book amortization of intangibles affecting relative amortization expense and other items that we do not consider reflective of underlying operating performance  we also present adjusted ebitda because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as a measure of performance in evaluating adjusted ebitda investors should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments described above  our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by expenses that are unusual nonroutine or nonrecurring  adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool in that among other things it does not reflect cash expenditures for capital expenditures or contractual commitments changes in or cash requirements for our working capital requirements interest expense or the cash required to replace assets that are being depreciated or amortized and the impact on our reported results of earnings or charges resulting from the items for which we make adjustments to our ebitda as described above and set forth in the table below in addition other companies including other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do limiting the usefulness of adjusted ebitda as a comparative measure  because of
