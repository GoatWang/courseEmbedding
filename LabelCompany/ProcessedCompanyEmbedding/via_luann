sales increases to be largely driven by our ecommerce channel and outlet stores we also expect our full price stores to generate positive comp we expect our total average square footage to be down approximately  for the year in our ecommerce business we see additional growth opportunity as we leverage our new web platform and expand our omni channel capabilities which will enable us to optimize our customer shopping experience our plan for the outlet business is to reposition this channel given the traffic challenges weve experienced this year the merchandise offering will have a

approximately  million to  million before giving effect to the cost that company would incur in connection with potential growth in overall sales we will provide further update on future calls i will now turn it over to pete to provide us our third quarter financial performance and our fourth quarter guidance peter michielutti thank you luann and good morning everyone my financial review today will cover the third quarter ended october   compared to the third quarter ended october   as well as some general comments regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year net sales in the third quarter of fiscal  were  million an increase of  compared to  million in last years third quarter comparable sales in the quarter increased  driven by a mid singledigit increase in our full price stores and a  increase in ecommerce partially offset by a decline in our outlet count for the quarter sales per square foot increased by  overall average dollar sales increased by  driven by a  growth in average unit retail partially offset by  decrease in units per transaction gross margin increased to  of net sales an improvement of  basis points compared to last years third quarter primarily due to leverage in our occupancy costs merchandise margin increased by  basis points in the third quarter of fiscal  penetrating from higher initial markups selling general and administrative expenses were  million compared to  million in last years third quarter the decline in sga dollars was due to lower store operating expenses reduced professional and advisory fees lower medical expenses and lower corporate expenses partly offset by higher marketing and ecommerce operating expenses sga decreased approximately  basis points to  of net sales compared to  in last years third quarter depreciation and amortization was  million which was flat to last years third quarter the third quarter net income was  million or  per diluted share last years third quarter net loss was  or  per share as more fully explained in the financial schedules accompanying our press release adjusted ebitda a nongaap measure was  million compared to  million in the same period last year we define adjusted ebitda as net income adjusted for income tax provisions other income and interest expense depreciation and amortization impairment of store assets and certain nonrecurring items for the first nine months of  sales were  million up  compared to the comparable period of  gross margin for the first nine months expanded approximately  basis points to  there were a couple of items in the first nine months of both years that were nonrecurring in nature yeartodate in  the company incurred advisory fees in connection with shareholder activism of approximately  million and ecommerce platform transition costs of  in the first nine months of  the company incurred advisory fees in connection with shareholder activism of approximately  excluding these items adjusted ebitda for the first nine months of  was  million and  increase compared to adjusted ebitda of  million in the prior year period now turning to the balance sheet we ended the third quarter with approximately  million of cash cash equivalents and investments this compares to  million at the end of the third quarter a year ago total inventory was  million as of october  compared to  million at october   an increase of  the increase in inventory during the quarter was due to higher intransit inventory at the end of the quarter partially offset by a  decrease in inventory on hand the overall composition of the inventory at the end of the quarter was very current with approximately  of the inventory represented by october or lifecycle products seasonal and core inventory capital expenditures for the third quarter of  were  million compared to  million in last years third quarter capital expenditures in the third quarter of fiscal  primarily reflected investments in new stores and technology associated with our customer first initiative the reduction yearoveryear reflects fewer new stores and lower technology investments due to substantial progress we have made in our customer first initiative we had borrowings in our revolving credit facility for the third quarter and have not drawn on the facility other than to open up letters of credit to the normal growth during the quarter we closed two mpw stores and one outlet store we opened one new mpw store at the end of the third quarter we had  million in retail square feet which is down  for the third quarter of last year we operated  of fewer stores at the end of the third quarter this year as of october   we operated  stores consisting of  mpw  outlets  christopher  banks  cj bank stores now on to our outlook following a slow start to november which we attribute to distraction from the election and warm weather we saw significant sequential improvement in sales postelections in the last week of the month based on these trends we anticipate sales for the fourth quarter to be between  million and  million correlating to  to  comparable sales increase as compared to  million and a comparable sales decrease of  in last years fourth quarter keep in mind that well be up against a twoyear stack sales increase of  in our ecommerce business in the fourth quarter we expect a net loss of  million to  million or  to  per share as compared to a net loss of  million or  per share in last years fourth quarter which included a  million or  per share valuation allowance for the project asset adjusted ebitda a nongaap measure is expected to be between approximately a negative  in a negative  million for the fourth quarter depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately  million compared to  million in last years fourth quarter we expect on hand inventory across the decline by low singledigits compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  during the fourth quarter we anticipate closing six mpw stores and closing  cb and cj stores and converting them into  mpw stores the average square footage in expected to be down  yearoveryear and no new stores are planned in the fourth quarter we expect average square footage for the year to be down approximately  as compared to fiscal  we expect capital expenditures for the year to between  million and  million representing investments in new stores as well as capital expenditures associated with completing the technology aspects of our customer first initiative we expect our taxes for the year to be nominal to represent minimum fees and taxes we anticipate ending the year with cash cash equivalent investment in the low to mid  million range as compared to  million at the end of last year’s fourth quarter that concludes our prepared remarks we will now open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of neely tamminga with piper jaffray please proceed with your question neely tamminga great good morning peter michielutti good morning neely luann via good morning neely tamminga yes congratulations this is the most stable earnings and report i think weve seen in the entire earnings season so well done to you all luann via thanks neely tamminga couple questions i think probably for luann we would love to hear a little bit more specifics because we’re really intrigued by concept of the reactivation of the relapsed customers so you guys have a really strong set phone calling event based grass roots efforts at the home at christopher  banks but where has that been integrated with print and digital for the specifics not just on acquisition but the reactivation of the relapsed customers we would love to hear more about the marketing efforts on that luann via so neely i think the most important piece is the direct mail we get a really strong response to direct mail generally and we have increased our circulation as it relates to lapsed because it relates to those customers that you know we may be lost as we combined stores so we have really put a major focus on expanding deeper into the file to get the  get those customers to come back into the store and i think one of the things to that as you know and you said were calling our customers our associates obviously are a major differentiator for us and they are very much engaged talking to the customers about we’ve redone the store come back and see us we have a great selection we have more style so i think we lost some traction obviously when we did the collapse and combines and the sizes were split and the customer  the cj customer thought that we closed her store and took hers the way and the conversion the missy customers thought that we obviously took her store away so combining the sizes and the new visuals we have in store is also i think based on what were getting right now a big piece of it as well so if you want to have just a couple of specifics we actually had in direct mail we were generating  more sales to last year with  more customers who spent  more per shopper so this whole active which we really focused on weve now really focused on extending that circulation to lapse neely tamminga that’s great and that is really some good news i have two separate types of questions on the merchandizing front if i may as well so first it sounds like you guys are doing a really good job at these exclusive collections of the thirdparty brand i may also personally own a pair of those diane gilman jeans that you guys stock so really good products but i was wondering if that’s opening up as you guys are doing more of that and you are obviously finding some positive comp traction are you getting people coming up out of the woodwork to do more of this with you just what does that landscape look like what is the potential for what that could be was that really a time period on it but over time i guess luann via so personally i think that we need additional differentiation in our assortments and one of the things when you are mainly a private label company sometimes the customer has the opinion that you dont have the brands obviously because you only have one brand and it is your name and the collections are also a differentiator its not about the same merchandise that we have so as you know with diane gilman its been a big win for us as it relates to bringing new customers into the store and we are looking to expand it so we do have a couple of other collections that are coming out in the spring season delivering in march and i dont know that theyre coming out of the woodwork but there are plenty of brands that really can create some major differentiation for us in the assortment and also get customers that just might not shop in our store and its really exciting for us because diane gilman obviously does a lot of business on air and once they get the product they are really liking it so were pretty excited about it so i think for the future nearly that we would continue to do that obviously we have a strong heritage with our brand but i think its time to make a little bit of a move as it relates to our total assortment and those branding efforts neely tamminga thats great thank you for that luann and then also on sweaters you called it out as a weakness i think nobrainer as the weakness around weather has just not been exactly most cooperative for all of retail but you guys are known for sweaters and so i guess what were trying to  were wondering about is where have sweaters been for you guys on the second half of november where it got really cold we removed the election distraction is that a category thats still showing signs of weakness and therefore we might have a merchandising issue or a mix issue or is it  did it pop luann via so i think theres two things to note here and you know our stores pretty well so our heritage was in sweaters so we really have looked at what is it that we need to do in the sweater business as a total because its been weak actually for the last five years six years and there is opportunity i think for us to bring back some of those really unique sweaters so one of the things that we found this year and it actually came in november late october early november and while yes whether absolutely did impacted i also think there were opportunities within the assortment to really differentiate us from our competitors and specifically department stores so how do we become put that special back in specialty and to really have that unique customer that comes to us for something special and sweaters has been our heritage so what we did was we said okay were going to look back and say what was relevant to us what did we really get from what details etcetera and we brought in a lot of novelty and i will tell you a little more expensive but the customer reacted very strongly to it and its interesting because they are more special so we actually were doing a sweater styleout yesterday for next year and i will tell you the special pieces that were going to integrate i think is going to really turn our sweater business throughout because the sweater business overall has been tough in the industry and some of it again is weatherrelated but there is more jackets and coats and different things that are really just taking over some of that business and we really need to make sure that were just different neely and that does set us apart so we did get a pop obviously when the weather came but it still is not our strongest category and theres an opportunity for that so its really a focus for us for  neely tamminga okay thats great best wishes and merry christmas happy holidays luann via thank you same to you peter michielutti thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeremy hamblin with dougherty  company please proceed with your questions jeremy hamblin good morning and i just want to add my congratulations really impressive results in a tough environment and great guidance i wanted to just make sure that i understood something on the q guidance i think pete that you had said you expect all channels to come positively in q does that include the store channel and then the online business peter michielutti no we said that there was mistake and we do not expect for it to comp positively in the fourth quarter jeremy hamblin okay luann via it was  we were talking about peter michielutti yes in  we haven’t given any sales guidance for  and weve talked about the initiatives that we have in  and the opportunities that we have for  but we really haven’t  we don’t take anything what we said for sales guidance for  do you want to talk about that jeremy hamblin no no no im talking about q specifically peter michielutti yes in q and neither for q we do expect continued positive performance out of the base stores and ecommerce stores in outlet stores were still working on we expect improvement in that in the next year jeremy hamblin okay great but coming back to q then for a second your online business i think you said was up  in the quarter which you gave like a twoyear stack of  peter michielutti yes i believe thats correct jeremy hamblin right up  last year as we look at  in general in online it sounds like youre continuing to expect that to be a big driver of business how much of that is just the opportunity to improve the efficiency the effectiveness of the platform and how much investment do you need to make in that business next year peter michielutti we believe we do have opportunity to continue to capitalize on the investments we have made this year and last year into the platform as we look to next year its more of a case of optimizing our marketing efforts and how to drive people to the website as well as when we look at and these end up being online sales through the store we call it aos as we do more tearing to our stores there is an opportunity to these inventories to be more productive by having it online rather than having in some of these volume stores so thats going to be driving throughput on ecommerce platform in efficient manner jeremy hamblin okay and further on that it sounds like the technology investments the systems investment in quantisense are starting to pay off because it sounds like youre really getting a better match on your inventory levels and your tearing by stores and by auvs of those stores and thats helping you to control where inventory should be can you just expand on that a little bit in terms of how that impact is developing here over the last couple of quarters and how we should expect that to continue to be a better match on inventory versus the storespecific metrics going forward luann via so jeremy i think there is two things first of all remember we implemented the store grading tool at the end of august so what were doing right now is utilizing that tool actually post the assortment so if the assortment is already on the way so that tool is now giving us guidance on how were going to post allocate merchandise as its coming in the great news is and thats been helpful obviously because we will be able to get it to the right stores etcetera the best news is that as we have it now going forward in  its going to give us the ability and it really starts in second back half of first quarter and the beginning of second quarter excuse me for us to do it before we make the purchases so it gives us an opportunity to have it before the goods are booked by store and here is what really helps us specifically as it relates to climate for our hot zones so that tool is going to really be beneficial and really optimizing our inventory productivity next year jeremy hamblin terrific and then just building on that a little bit more as we think about the statement in here of the  million to  million in potential for net savings next year some of that seems like its tied to store closures i know that youre closing  net stores in q how should we think about that going forward pete can you give us a little bit more detail on these store closures in terms of the net impact on a profitability standpoint are these stores  some of these stores providing negative fourwall performance and thats why theyre closing just any additional color on that  million to  million in savings and how it ties into your store base peter michielutti so as it relates to the implications on the store closures the store closures the  at the end of the year the  that becomes  which are the mpw stores we expect improved border lines in closing those stores so this should be accretive to performance for next year on the other six stores that are closing theyre marginally profitable or theyre negative for all contributions and the ones that are marginally profitable we get sales transfer opportunity into the current store base so the way  and the reason we discuss it the way we did is its early we’re still early in the fourth quarter to start talking about anything specific from a sales standpoint but we believe that by these cost reduction opportunities and some of them are as we talked about there is occupancy savings and there and some of those occupancy savings we do have a lot of short term leases that we have opportunities from reducing some of our rent cost on existing stores as we do these renewals and weve taken a lot of efforts this year and early analyzing each component of our cost and we have specific cost savings on a lot of things freight we have on supplies that the new platform is going to give us savings next year or efficient platform so there is a lot of specific things that we’re doing from a cost perspective of taking cost out of the business and so we believe that based on where we are today and going into next year even sales don’t change that we believe even with some store closings you can get flat sales yearoveryear we can cut these costs and put us into a positive operating income range before any impacts of increasing sales jeremy hamblin wow that’s impressive and great to hear last question i think and its really related to the rent that you just discussed in terms of where you feel like you have negotiating opportunities and potentially reducing rents are you seeing that primarily in the b and c mall locations and how does it compare to what youre seeing in your a mall location on the rent front peter michielutti as you know your ability to negotiating depends on a couple things where you are in your lease term and where the specific center is in their occupancy rate so i’m not going to give way into any of our negotiating power by having a discussion with you over the phone on this but we believe there is opportunity wherever we are have to discussions with landlords because we think we are a meaningful player and i think they want to keep the occupancy up in their centers and we have very good relationships with our landlords jeremy hamblin great well thanks so much for taking the questions and best of luck moving forward peter michielutti okay thank you luann via thanks jeremy operator thank you miss via there are no further questions at this time i’d like to turn the floor back to you for further remarks luann via thank you looking back on the

an old playbook in recent years the women’s clothing retailer lost its way opening too many stores and introducing new merchandise that was too casual too trendy and too expensive samestore sales fell

subscriberonly story for free by visiting the business journal on linkedin on facebook or on twitter “we walked away from our core customer” via said during a recent interview at the company’s plymouth headquarters “we wanted her to be somebody she wasn’t” since taking over as ceo in november  via has closed hundreds of stores and overhauled christopher  banks’ inventory leading to a dramatic improvement in the company’s financial results it posted a samestore sales gain of  percent in fiscal  and the company ended the year in the black for the first time since  the chain still faces challenges including a soft economy a crowded marketplace and a lack of national brand recognition but chairman paul snyder believes the company is back on track for success under via a year retail veteran who previously led brands such as payless shoesource lane bryant and catherines stores “we knew we had to get this right because in the situation we were in at the time if we didn’t get it right we probably were not going to get a second chance at it” snyder said of the ceo selection process in  “we needed somebody who could come in and provide leadership to the organization and continue the turnaround we had started … she’s all we thought she would be and then some” via and chief financial officer peter michielutti have outlined a threeyear plan that calls for christopher  banks to post midsingledigit samestore sales growth and annual squarefootage growth of  to  percent by  along with expanding margins and reduced costs “we are laser focused on executing what we’ve told the street we’re going to execute” said via who commutes to the twin cities weekly from her home in memphis tenn “we’re not going to take a diversion it’s a dynamic business so you tweak assortments you tweak marketing and you do what you need to do from a promotional perspective but we have to stay focused on delivering the plan that’s my job” analysts are bullish on the outlook forecasting improved profitability ahead piper jaffray  co’s neely tamminga expects the company’s operating margin to top  percent within three years up from  percent last year “it’s completely doable and i could probably move higher over time” she said “strongperforming apparel retailers can produce doubledigit operating margins so we think their opportunity is pretty significant” merchandise mix in some regards christopher  banks’ merchandising missteps were similar to those at jc penney co inc during its recent struggles both companies changed too quickly and dramatically in an effort to attract new customers losing sight of what their most loyal customers liked about their brands christopher  banks’ customers kept coming back to the chain’s stores during that time via said but they weren’t buying because the stores didn’t have the products they wanted anymore “for some there’s a desire to have a younger and trendier customer and that’s where the prior management had taken the company” dougherty  co analyst jeremy hamblin said “the customer always votes with their dollars and that’s why samestore sales went down dramatically” via immediately set out to reconnect with those loyal shoppers whom she refers to as “friends” they’re typically between the ages of  and  with average household incomes of more than  seventy percent of them work outside the home mostly in the administrative education and health care sectors “she’s not edgy she’s a fashion follower not a fashion leader” via said “and you know what she’s not sexy like lane bryant or as contemporary as a chico’s customer she’s middle america” so christopher  banks has gone back to its roots liquidating its new trendier merchandise and refocusing on the key product categories that historically generated the strongest results — a process that started under interim ceo joel waller prior to via’s arrival the company has placed more emphasis on jeans and its most popular dress pants while also introducing slimming pants wrinkleresistant blouses skirts and dresses “i would tell you on our assortment the customer is voting yes” via said “even in the fourth quarter when we were slightly below our prioryear sales our conversion rate was up our units per transaction were up and our margin was up so we were making more money” meanwhile christopher  banks has increased its marketing budget to attract “lookalike customers” who fit the demographic profile of its core shoppers the company spent  percent of sales on marketing last year up from  percent the year before with the largest percentage of that budget going toward direct mail it sent out  million directmail pieces in the fourth quarter twice as many as during the same period last year “we get tremendous response rates from our directmail pieces so we have overinvested there as it relates to our total spend” via said “that’s really our focus” store strategy when via arrived at christopher  banks she quickly discovered that the chain’s real estate strategy wasn’t the right fit it needed to try on a new smaller size so the chain which had swelled to  locations by the end of  closed many of the cj banks stores the company had added in the mids and began consolidating the plussize brand with its flagship christopher  banks line wherever possible it’s now down to  stores so far christopher  banks has converted  stores to its new missy petite and women mpw format — the centerpiece of via’s longterm real estate strategy by the end of  it will have  the transition saves the company millions on real estate and labor costs plus  percent of its customers shop both at christopher  banks and cj banks brands because women aren’t always the same size on top as on the bottom “ushering in this mpw strategy is going to be a big part of via’s legacy going forward” tamminga said “she’s really figured out the right balance of bringing the different sizing under one roof they can more efficiently manage their instore labor and it’s more efficient from a salesproductivity perspective in terms of the return on capital” meanwhile christopher  banks is targeting outlet malls as another growth channel the company has  such locations including one at albertville premium outlets but via wants to expand that to between  and  outlets within the next three years those locations like the company’s new mpw stores carry a full array of christopher  banks and cj banks merchandise and outlet malls also help open the door for the chain in some new markets especially in the south where’s its stores are scarce “we can go into a market where they don’t know us very well” via said “it’s a destination and customers aren’t as brand conscious there so we get more of a captive audience” changing market despite its recent success christopher  banks still faces headwinds as the economy remains soft and the weather has challenged apparel retailers christopher  banks’ samestore sales decreased  percent in the first quarter as store traffic declined  percent largely due to the brutal cold and snow in january on top of that the women’s specialty retail segment is oversaturated with stores operated by national chains like chico’s talbots and ann taylor and despite its recent successes christopher  banks remains a regional brand concentrated in the midwest and northeast “it’s a really competitive segment to be in and christopher  banks doesn’t have the brand awareness that some of the other players have” said tina wilcox the ceo and creative director at retail branding agency black retail but the segment is changing rapidly sandpoint idahobased coldwater creek for example recently filed for bankruptcy and plans to close all of its  stores nationwide that could open the door for christopher  banks to boost its market share tamminga said “we still see women’s apparel as a category that has room for expansion” she said “we think the next nine months will be very telling as to who the winners and losers are” christopher  banks customers age range  percent married  average household income  k  percent more than national average work outside the home  percent primarily in administration
