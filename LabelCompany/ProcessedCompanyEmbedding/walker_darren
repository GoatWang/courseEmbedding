continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story talent is equally distributed but opportunity is not and while many americans believe fervently and faithfully in expanding opportunity america’s internshipindustrial complex does just the oppositeas the summer internship season gets into full swing consider for instance how a plum internship may alter a young person’s career trajectory while some students take a summer job in food service to pay the bills others can afford to accept unpaid jobs at highprofile organizations setting them on a more lucrative pathi remember my own paid internships with fondness and gratitude especially my formative experience working for the texas legislature as a lowincome kid from a small town who entered college without an extended network my internships equipped me with the skills confidence and relationships to channel my potential into a rewarding careerand whether it’s an internship college admission or any of the many other factors that determine a successful life leaders who say they want to address inequality actually — and often unconsciously — reinforce the dynamics that create inequality in their own lives advertisement continue reading the main story even when financial considerations are no object networking — the role of parents and others in helping young people score internships — disadvantages students from places that are underrepresented in positions of leadership continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story we often hear that success is “all about the people you know” — as if it’s just a matter of equalopportunity relationship building we rarely talk about how one knows them or about the privilege that has become a prerequisite to knowing the right people i sometimes get calls and emails from friends seeking help in landing internships for their children i understand what they’re doing this is part of being a parent still it’s a reminder that america’s current internship system in which contacts and money matter more than talent contributes to an economy in which access and opportunity go to the people who already have the most of boththe stakes of america’s broken internship system are high as report after report reminds us this generation of students faces significantly worse job prospects than its predecessors without the shortterm opportunities to help them learn grow connect with mentors and begin climbing the earnings curve many promising young people with limited means are denied the chance to rise as high as their talent will take themthe result is not limited to the labor market the broader implication is privilege multiplied by privilege a compounding effect prejudiced against students who come from workingclass or lowerincome circumstances by shutting out these students from entrylevel experiences in certain fields entire sectors engineer longterm deficits of muchneeded talent and perspective in other words we’re all paying the price for unpaid internshipsfortunately there is another option many organizations are beginning to pay interns this is important because employers should not only compensate students for their time and contributions but also eliminate barriers that prevent lowincome and underrepresented students from pursuing these opportunitieswhile some nonprofits may be unable to pay their interns — even though they depend on their contributions of energy and knowhow — the government can help turn unpaid positions into paid opportunities for those at risk of getting left behinda few years ago researchers at the economic policy institute and demos proposed using existing student aid programs — including federal workstudy and the free application for federal student aid — to facilitate internship grants for lowincome students their proposed student opportunity program would provide funding equal to  for threemonth grants and  for sixmonth grants to students who couldn’t afford to work without compensationat the same time while compensating interns is necessary it is not sufficient newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign
