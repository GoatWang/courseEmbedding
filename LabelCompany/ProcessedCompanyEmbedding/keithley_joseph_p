new york sics  instruments to measure electricity  measuring  controlling devices not elsewhere classified company history celebrating its th anniversary in  keithley instruments inc is one of the worlds leading manufacturers of specialty electronic testing and measurement devices while its sales are just a fraction of its primary competitor multibilliondollar hewlett packard co keithley instruments has carved out a niche for itself in the highmargin hightech end of the electronic monitoring industry the companys awardwinning products are sold in more than  countries around the world and its stock began trading on the new york stock exchange in  under the direction of joseph p keithley in the mids keithley instruments shifted its primary focus to the fastgrowing semiconductor testing market this change in strategy was expected to rejuvenate the companys growth which had stagnated in the early s postwar origins keithley was founded in  by joseph f keithley who graduated from the massachusetts institute of technology with a masters degree in engineering in  after working for bell telephone laboratories in the late s keithley served at the us naval ordnance laboratory during world war ii at the wars end he moved to cleveland to take a job with massa labs but when the company relocated in  keithley elected to stay on in cleveland and establish his own company his first product the phantom repeater amplified lowlevel electric signals so that they could be measured by more standard equipment the device was used by physicists chemists and engineers in the development of hearing aids and amplifiers for example keithley later noted that the phantom repeater was only a reasonable success but it did win him a costplus fixedfee contract with the us navy keithley worked alone assembling mostly outsourced components until  when he hired his first employee keithley added to its product line that year as well on the advice of war buddy and bryn mawr head of physics dr walter michels joseph keithley developed a high input impedance dc voltmeter dubbed the model  this device provided researchers with a convenient way to test and measure the performance of electrical insulatorsthe plastic covering on a copper wire for example barrons writer william m alpert later explained that the model  could measure how good an insulator was at keeping the electrical juice from spilling into where it did not belong keithley later told jeff dorsch of chiltons electronic news that the machine brought his young company reasonable prosperity over the course of the s keithley developed three primary lines of highly sensitive instruments general purpose electrometers microvolt meters and picoammeters picoammeters which measure electric currents in terms of picoamperes provide a good example of the sensitivity of keithleys devices one picoampere equals a millionth of a millionth of an ampere or a millionth of a millionth of the amount of current it takes to power a watt light bulb fueled indirectly by hefty governmental expenditures on research during the cold war era keithley enjoyed  percent to  percent annual sales growth in the s surpassing  in annual sales in  and  million in  keithley incorporated in  product and geographic expansionduring the s and s during the s keithley shifted its focus somewhat to the development of products for americas growing space program with a special emphasis on satellite research probes these efforts evolved into keithleys special products division which served such diverse disciplines as oceanography biomedicine nuclear energy geophysics and analytical chemistry as well as industrial quality control the companys product line grew and evolved throughout the decade adopting digital display for example keithley undertook foreign growth relatively early in its history having placed sales representatives throughout europe by  keithley established its first overseas office in lausanne switzerland the company founded assembly and repair operations in munich in  and created a british subsidiary keithley instruments ltd in  keithley made an initial public offering in  and moved to a purposebuilt headquarters in solon a suburb of cleveland in  sales increased from  million in  to  million in  the company began to apply its expertise to the development of testing and measuring devices for medical and industrial applications in the s at the same time keithley devices were evolving to incorporate newly developed technologies like integrated circuits and microprocessors in  a yearold joseph keithley set his longterm plan for transfer of corporate leadership into motion by promoting thomas g brick to president keithley retained the chair and chief executive office the end of the decade brought a major transformation of keithleys corporate culture indeed the companys rapid growth had spawned several problems including excessive labor expenses a high rate of inwarranty repairs and poor employee relations worse some managers felt that the company was not prepared for the possibility of future growth in order to combat these interrelated problems the company adopted a team manufacturing approach forming person squads of employees responsible for the production of specific devices from start to finish this strategy which was fully implemented by  reduced inwarranty repairs by  percent lowered absenteeism by  percent increased employee productivity by  percent and helped resolve labormanagement relations acquisitions in the s this fundamental culture shift set the stage for continued growth in the s fueled in part by acquisitions and overseas expansion keithley broadened its global reach with the creation of subsidiaries and sales offices in austria switzerland hong kong and japan during the decade by  the company had eight overseas subsidiaries and  international representatives and foreign revenues constituted nearly half of annual sales the decline of the us dollar in the s made keithleys international operations evermore vital during this period of domestic recession while much of the electronics industry suffered through one of its most difficult decades keithleys annual sales increased from  million in  to  million in  and  million in  profits more than quadrupled from  million in  to a high of over  billion in  during the mid to late s keithley paved the way to what would become a key avenue of growth in  the company created a joint venture with bostons data acquisition systems inc to computerize data collected by keithley instruments keithley acquired the remainder of the venture in  and merged it into itself as the data acquisition and control division having accumulated  million in cash by early  keithley acquired three companies with interrelated products through  that year the company merged these three firmsadaptable laboratory software inc macmillan software co and metrabyte corpmdash the keithley metrabyte division this division created software and hardware that converted raw data into easily read and interpreted graphics and charts keithley metrabyte also made highly durable field pcs that could endure impacts of up to  times the force of gravity according to reed abelson of fortune magazine by  keithley boasted the broadest product line in personal computer hardware and software to collect and analyze scientific and engineering information the combination of acquisitions and internal growth more than doubled sales from  million in  to over  million in  but at the same time profits peaked at  million in  then started to slide in the waning years of the decade as defense and research cutbacks decimated the budgets of keithleys primary customers annual sales eroded from  million in  to  million in  and net income plummeted to a loss of  million with its core market declining keithley reduced its work force from  in  to  in  it seemed only a glitch among the megadownsizings of the early s but put a significant damper on morale nonetheless change in leadership and change indirection in early s in  joseph f keithley conferred voting control and the chairmanship over to his son joseph p keithley the elder keithley continued to work at his namesake firm under the simple title of founder he was widely recognized as a pioneer in highprecision instrumentation in  he was inducted into the national academy of engineering and in  the american physical society created a cash award in honor of his contribution to the field of measurement and testing realizing that he could not rely on defense and research budgets for longterm corporate growth the younger keithley sought a new direction for his company he found it in keithleys own systems division a business segment that had developed and manufactured automated parametric testers apt devices that examined semiconductor chips for quality control since the early s the semiconductor production process involved the creation of eightinch wafers each of which held about  individual computer chips apts tested the chips near the end of the production process with sensitive electrical measurements in  keithley augmented that business with the  million acquisition of a new semiconductor testing technology from ibm this new device dubbed the quantox oxide monitoring system improved on older quality control methods on several levels quantox was designed to be implemented early in the production process allowing for the disposal of inferior product before the manufacturer had invested too much in it the device also reduced inspection time from up to five days to  minutes and since it was a contactless process it did not require the destruction of every wafer tested in  joseph f keithley told cleveland magazine that every integrated circuit fabrication line in the world can benefit from this keithley agreed to pay ibm a royalty on each of the  machines the ceo made it clear that semiconductor process monitoring would become a key aspect of keithleys future strategy in  alone the company invested over  million in development of the new device chairman keithley told crains cleveland business that he expected quantox and similar devices to become the companys most important products bringing in  million to  million in annual sales by the end of the decade in  products sold to semiconductor manufacturers constituted onefourth of keithleys sales although keithley enjoyed a technological edge in the realm of semiconductor process monitoring it faced a formidable competitor in hewlett packard which controlled an estimated  percent of the global parametric testing market investor confidence in the proprietary quantox technology boosted keithleys stock from less than  in the early s to over  in  but the stock was thinly traded the family still owned a large proportion of the equity and keithley instruments only had about  stockholders in order to draw the attention of institutional investors and obtain access to more credit the firm distributed two shares to each of its employees and encouraged existing shareholders to give their shares to a spouse in order to increase the companys float in  keithleys shares earned a spot on the new york stock exchange quantox wasnt the only promising development at keithley in the mids by this time the companys metrabyte division had become a key player in the emerging market for virtual instruments computer components that could measure current andor voltage then quantify the resulting data individual investors david sterman called metrabyte a golden goose at keithley even the venerable instruments division bounced back registering doubledigit sales growth in  analyst kevin morrow of the ohio co credited joseph p keithley who had assumed the additional responsibilities of president and chief executive officer upon the early retirement of thomas g brick in  with the companys newfound success he told david prizinsky of crains cleveland business that there was no sales growth until jp took over the company a year ago he lit a fire under everyone that conflagration helped boost revenues to a

announces discontinuance of its s series parametric test product line february    pm eastern standard time clevelandbusiness wirekeithley instruments inc nyse kei a world leader in advanced electrical test instruments and systems today announced that it is discontinuing its s series parametric test product line the company will continue to accept orders for s series testers until february  and will continue to provide technical support calibration and repair services for five years through february  joseph p keithley the company’s chairman stated “the financial crisis that has precipitated the global economic recession has analysts now projecting capital equipment spending for semiconductor production applications down  percent in  after contracting roughly  percent in  device companies continue to announce pushouts of new mm fabs to  and beyond from dates given earlier semiconductor manufacturing foundries do not expect device demand to return to  levels before  orders for our s series product line serving these customers have been declining now for many quarters based on these facts and because we do not expect to be able to achieve results from this product line that are consistent with our business model we have made the extremely difficult decision to discontinue the product line we remain focused on managing our liquidity and aligning our cost structure with the current economic reality” “keithley has been serving semiconductor customers for many decades with a broad range of products for research development and production applications our commitment to the semiconductor industry and to our customers remains strong despite this action although we will no longer pursue fullyautomated highvolume parametric test applications we remain focused on serving the industry’s rd and lowvolume production test applications with our dc instrumentation model  semiconductor characterization system and automated characterization suite acs family” stated keithley sales from the company’s s series products have not represented a significant portion of total revenue since mid furthermore the product line has been characterized by quarterly order volatility over the years the company believes that exiting this product line should lessen the company’s overall volatility the company currently estimates that the annualized cost savings associated with this action will approximate  million the estimated cost of this action is expected to be between  and  million on a pretax basis which includes approximately  million for a six percent worldwide reduction in force and approximately  to  million for noncash asset impairment charges the majority of the costs are expected to be incurred during the company’s second quarter of fiscal  forward looking

machines that the company makes founded in  solons keithley instruments makes hightech monitoring and testing machines used by companies that make computer chips and electronic devices joseph p keithley has been chairman president and chief executive since  these are excerpts from a chat last week between keithley son of company founder joseph f keithley and plain dealer reporter robert schoenberger the question you joined the company as a lowlevel manager when your father was still running keithley how did your relationship with the founder position affect your job the answer i was always careful of not trying to be someone who i wasnt i had the mental set of manager production inventory control i wouldnt have lunch with my father or be part of the senior operating team    youre a young manager and you havent been one before its easy to make mistakes and it can really be amplified when youre the son of the boss the question would it have been better to have gotten your first management job at a different company the answer definitely if i hadnt come to keithley i would have had the kind of experiences that everybody else has which really can make a difference the question what did that first managerial job teach you the answer youre working with people you really have to put people first they need to know what it is that needs to be done you have to be clear with that dont micromanage you establish the goal and you let them work it out the question what surprised you most about that experience the answer the power of the team the person who is responsible for it the manager isnt necessarily the person with the best ideas if hes capable he can get his teammates to think through and come up with a better approach than any one person could do the question how do you get employees to follow your vision the answer part of it is spending time with people the other part is having them participate in setting the goal then testing it so it isnt some number that was pulled out of the air    they can be good critics you have to have them thinking does this make sense the question in challenging times such as  how do you manage the fiscal risks of a company tied to highgrowth sectors such as semiconductors the answer my financial philosophy has not been to have debt theres enough volatility in our sales that to have a banker say at just the wrong time please pay up isnt anything that i want to face we didnt have that kind of problem    we had a core group of products where sales were falling we discontinued one product line and we sold our rf radio frequency instrumentation business to a competitor from a strategic standpoint that caused us to have less growth opportunities for the future but its positioned us now to be highly profitable at low levels of sales the question whats the best part about being the boss the answer you get to look out over a several year period and watch the company grow and strengthen so youre looking forward but at the same time you have the pleasure of the accomplishments also i get to watch how our products and our organization are helping change the world as the electronics industry changes the question whats the worst part the answer this last year we reduced our work force by  percent or so thats having people who were doing a good job not be with you to protect your viability so it hurts from a personal standpoint it hurts because of the impact you know youre having on others and it hurts because you have to back off from some of your initiatives that you had hopes for top workplaces top workplaces
