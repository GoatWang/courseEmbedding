awaiting the transplant cigna notes that it had no financial stake in the decision to authorize the transplant because it merely administers the insurance plan of mr sarkisyans employer and would not bear the cost of any operation however cigna offered to pay for the transplant itself when it made the exception to the policy even though liver transplants have been performed since  and are a well accepted treatment option for endstage liver disease and acute liver failure cigna defended its actions by claiming that there was insufficient data to show that a transplant for a patient in sarkisyans condition would be safe and effective the california court agreed with cigna’s position that the sarkisyans’ claims regarding cignas decisionmaking were preempted by federal erisa law on
