internet’s impact on marketing is undeniable it may be exaggerated according to internet world stats  percent of the population in the us is online and  percent access facebook at least once a month that still leaves nearly  million americans who can’t be reached through online marketing efforts and while  percent of americans are aware of twitter only  percent actually use it this creates a world of opportunities for advertisers to reach out through offline media channels offline marketing contents in this article what is offline marketing who employs offline marketing how is an offline marketing plan developed and employed what types of careers work with offline marketing strategies how can a marketing school help you succeed in a company who uses this type of marketing strategy even though the arrival of the internet appeared to be the end for printbased and other “dated” mediums marketing campaigns using offline channels are still a fundamental aspect of many company’s marketing mixes in fact according to a recent study conducted by google in partnership with ipsos medict traditional offline media such as tv radio and print still plays a leading role in online searches for products and services what is offline marketing given the internet’s tremendous rise in popularity today’s marketers refer to other media channels that aren’t connected to the world wide web as “offline” offline marketing strategies utilize offline media channels to create awareness of a company’s products and services these campaigns can include radio and print advertising – including billboards signs and pamphlets – telemarketing and television ads see also outdoor marketing occasionally perfect offline marketing the most perfunctory medium in an offline marketing campaign is normally the billboard even with the most creative marketing strategy behind it a billboard is almost always just a much larger version of a print advertisement but in one of the more creative offline initiatives heineken transformed one into a surprise concert performance tied to social media the beer company’s “occasionally perfect” campaign began with a simple billboard in manhattan that for one night became the stage for the band tv on the radio the billboard will be appearing in other cities across the us where it will host similar performances to find out the details on where the billboard is going to be and its next performance users have to follow the occasionallyperfect hashtag on twitter since it’s almost a prerequisite for any business today to have its own website offline marketing strategies are now frequently tied to company’s online efforts for example companies such as ford have created print ads that include sparse information about new vehicles with predominant urls and references to facebook or iphones who employs offline marketing companies large and small use offline media channels to build buzz about products or services the strategies can be applied by companies of any size from momandpop storefronts in small communities to some of the largest and most renowned brands in the world the companies developing offline marketing strategies fit a number of profiles including “mom and pop” businesses – smaller operations that want to establish a name or foothold in a local community businesses such as family restaurants local salons and boutiques or independent photography studios can use ads in community newspapers or small targeted direct mail pieces to establish themselves in the limited area they serve regional and midsized businesses – companies with large customer bases that need to reach customers in a metropolitan area or geographic region construction companies automotive dealers and grocery store chains are among those businesses that can build familiarity with customers through traditional advertising means billboards regional television commercials and radio spots can spread the word about a company and build its credibility major nationalinternational companies – large corporations with recognizable names and brand characteristics target applebee’s kohl’s godaddy budweiser dick’s sporting goods – these are just a few of the major corporations that keep a regular presence in national marketing campaigns involving offline media channels each of these company’s campaigns features high frequency placement and a focus on brand awareness how is an offline marketing plan developed and employed offline marketing strategies tend to be more expensive than online ones requiring businesses to develop allencompassing plans before implementing campaigns typically a company must first decide exactly who they are trying to reach – the target demographic for either new or existing services – and then determine what media channels can be used to reach them market research data can be purchased to bring companies up to speed on the media consumption habits of their target audience if potential customers tend to read certain magazines then marketers can strategically place ads in those publications these ads typically feature consistent messaging about the company as well as brand imagery – the same slogans and logos are used to build familiarity with potential customers recently offline marketing and online marketing strategies are more frequently used in collaboration with one another many companies treat their websites as the central portals of their marketing efforts most consumers who want to know more about a company’s products or services will at some point visit the website for information and contact details the principle theme between the offline and online marketing partnership is to make the company’s website better known see also integrated marketing for example if a national electronics store is hosting a sale in honor of an important anniversary the company’s intent is to attract the attention of customers to come into the store and take advantage of celebration sales if the store limits itself to only showcasing this information on their website and no other methods to publicize the event the company is limiting the number of potential sales instead the store might advertise the anniversary sale in newspapers and other offline mediums that also include information about the stores website these offline ads can feature tracking url’s landing pages or qr codes by using these options the store can analyze where its audience is coming from who they are and how many have responded to the call to action for the anniversary event offline marketing strategies behind the ad campaigns and creative promotional materials the basic intention of any offline marketing strategy is to increase online traffic overall sales and profits there are various strategies companies can employ to achieve these results including direct mail – “snail mail” as it’s commonly referred to is one of the most commonly used mediums in offline marketing campaigns marketers can purchase mailing lists based on demographic data that include people most likely to purchase their products for example an online pet food store may order lists of people who purchase pet supplies or medicines online discount pricing – another way to drive customers directly to a company’s website is to offer coupons online department stores grocery stores and countless other companies frequently advertise sales of their products and services in local newspapers and advertising inserts rather than including coupons in the newspaper these ads can instruct customers to print their coupons from the company’s website if they want a discount they have to make a stop online loyalty programs – to build repeat customers companies of all sizes often rely on offline loyalty programs these programs encourage customers to patronize businesses more frequently for example a sandwich shop may reward customers with a free sandwich on their tenth visit or a professional baseball team might offer a free stadium tour to fans that purchase ticket to  or more home games what types of careers work with offline marketing strategies despite the explosive growth of the internet careers involving offline marketing will be available for the foreseeable future marketing companies – or other businesses with internal marketing and communications teams –

opportunities homedigital marketing facebook household ip targeting online marketing sales strategyonline products for offline buyers online products for offline buyers  apr online products for offline buyers megan malonet by megan malone digital marketing facebook household ip targeting online marketing sales strategy comments off on online products for offline buyers there are many media buyers out there that are devouring as much information as they can about digital advertising given that the marketing landscape has changed so drastically  a media mix used to include placing a television radio direct mail newspaper phone book or a billboard buy   now with the introduction of a countless number of digital products that are literally changing daily the buying landscape has become much more confusing  luckily if you know what has worked offline for you in the past there is an online counterpart that mirrors traditional mediums if you buy television buy preroll or social video  television promotes a visual story to a captive audience who indexes high for your target demographic based on the types of shows you are watching  video preroll commercials that play prior to the content a target customer is consuming does the same thing but instead of targeting shows you target the keywords people are typing in online their previous online behavior or even the types of websites they are visiting   if you place a video buy on social instead of the ad running before content it actually auto plays within the users native newsfeed  facebook also recently introduced “midstream” video that pauses the content someone is viewing to show your short commercial  the best part is you don’t have to worry about people dvring past your commercial  you only pay once the viewer has seen at least  of your ad if you buy radio buy ad networks   radio is a high frequency medium that targets listeners based on the content they are listening to  radio stations promote their content to buyers by matching audiences with a high demographic index like adult contemporary stations and moms to brands seeking those audiences   digital ad networks work the same way   an ad network is showing your display or video ads on groups of websites targeted to the type of audience you want to reach  instead of buying a radio station you can instead buy hundreds of websites all geared to targeting that mom  it’s a broad reach with a high frequency depending on your geographic targeting area if you buy direct mail buy household ip targeting   the best thing about direct mail is its hyper targeting capability  the worst thing about direct mail is how expensive it is to get a high frequency to help promote your message and the fear someone is taking your marketing piece straight from the mailbox to the trashcan without reading it   household ip targeting takes the direct mail marketing approach and gives it frequency  this patented technology matches individual household ip addresses to a database of names and physical addresses displaying your display or video ad only to those people in those specific households on your list   by using your direct mail data list you can target oneonone to a specific household or business and figure out your marketing return on investment after each campaign by matching who came through as a customer with who you were ip targeting from your list if you buy newspapers buy news and information digital ad networks   your goal with buying newspapers is to reach an informed audience possibly even business owners who are consuming the news daily   you can target people looking at news content on their mobile phones on both national and local news websites across all devices or even target people who are business owners based on their previous online behavior  and remember the old newspaper term “buying above or below the fold”  the same is true for digital buying with above the fold ads at the top of the website being amongst the most valuable inventory if you buy the phonebook consider seo with a focus on directory listings   buyers valued the phonebook in the past because it was the last place a customer looked up information before they made a buying decision  today people use the internet and website directory listings as their phonebook   a good search engine optimization seo strategy will not only put your phone number in major search engines as a business listing and update your google knowledge graph which is the information on the righthand column of a search engine results page where google displays your business information but lists your business information on directories like the yellow pages yelp foursquare yellow book and more if you buy billboards buy mobile conquesting or facebook local awareness ads  it’s all about location for you if you are buying billboards  you’re already ahead of the game with billboard marketing because it works very similarly to banner ad creation you want as few words as you can on the ad to get your marketing message across to the end customer   your digital match for location buying is mobile conquesting which uses location based targeting combined with demographic and behavioral targeting to reach consumers with display ads on their mobile devices   another strategy for targeting people in a given location are facebook’s local awareness ads which is drawing a radius around a location you want to target and only displaying your ads to a specific age or gender  billboard buying oftentimes is about driving traffic to a given location   both of the products mentioned above have “get directions” or “click to call” buttons that guide a customer on their smartphone to your location or to call you directly
