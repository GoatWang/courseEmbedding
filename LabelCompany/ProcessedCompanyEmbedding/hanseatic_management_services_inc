quarter  hanseatic market commentary us equities finished both a strong second quarter and a first half of  stocks were boosted by solid corporate earnings and investor optimism about the prospects for improving economic growth the nasdaq paced the advance with a  gain in the first  months even as the index and technology stocks in general spent the entire month of june in correction mode the sp  gained  and the russell  gained  in the first half the advances were broad from a sector standpoint within the sp  healthcare gained  and technology gained  while most other sectors performed in line with the index energy was the sole loser down  the sp  index including dividends gained every month in the first half of the year and is up  months in a row for the first time since  historically persistent consecutive monthly gains in the sp  have been a reliable harbinger of further gains in the months ahead since  there has been  prior instances where the market advanced more than  consecutive months in each instance the market posted solid gains over the next year we believe the recent correction in technology stocks is healthy and likely amended some overly optimistic sentiment this correction is ongoing and may persist a few more weeks but our model currently has high probabilities of further gains in the tech sector the breathless reporting on the faang stocks facebook apple amazon netflix and google seems to suggest that these stocks are akin to the “nifty fifty” stock phenomenon that preceded the  bear market andor are so overvalued that they are in bubble territory circa  neither of these assertions are remotely accurate from our perspective there are two important bullish factors taking place beneath the market surface the first is the positive breadth in technology stocks in the ongoing secular bull market by our model measurement the equal weight index of technology stocks in the sp  has outperformed the ndx  index which accords large weights to most all the faang stocks the three tech stocks within faang have performed very well our point is that a surprising number of other tech stocks have also delivered excellent returns the second significant positive market influence is the recent improvement in the industrial healthcare and financial sectors after a strong rally postelection the industrial sector has consolidated on an absolute basis but lost ground relative to benchmarks there is emerging leadership in capital goodsheavy industrial stocks and railroads along with continuing performance in aerospacedefense stocks healthcare stocks peaked on a relative basis two years ago after four years of sustained leadership there is considerable uncertainty about the prospect of healthcare reforms but there has been notable relative improvement in many healthcare stocks especially within biotech financial stocks also topped shortly after a postelection rally presumably on hopes of less regulatory red tape most all stocks in the sector have improved of late probably helped by the recent steepening in the yield curve our bond models suggest the probability of higher interest rates ahead which is beneficial to this sector we believe positive leadership across multiple sectors and industry groups is essential for a healthy secular trend in the second quarter global markets were up strong led by nonus markets the growth was broadly distributed among various countries and international indices were ahead of us indices helped by a weak us dollar the beginning of the quarter saw a switch from emerging markets leadership to being led by developed markets especially the eu though much of the gains were given up in june japan and the emerging markets held gains for the quarter global political developments including in france and the uk lead to a decline in uncertainty in europe and an increase in uncertainty in the uk in may brazilian markets corrected as bribery allegations of president michel temer emerged and curbed the markets enthusiasm for the pension and labor reforms oddly though the second strongest country etf is south korea which is obviously not immune to geopolitical risk the emerging markets equities look to be performing best helped by us dollar weakness and improving em growth chinese growth is expected to slow for the rest of the year due to rising rates and a slowdown of housing and construction this along with tighter global monetary policy is expected to lead to possible em market volatility though overall looking forward to the second half of  our outlook is sanguine our long term market model continues to display the characteristics of a low volatility persistent uptrend attributes that are inconsistent historically with market behavior in the late stages of a secular bull market this positive domestic outlook is supported by a synchronized bull market in global equities the first by our estimation since  hanseatic quarterly composite

next year view analyst ratings for freeportmcmoran what are analysts saying about freeportmcmoran stock here are some recent quotes from research analysts about freeportmcmoran stock  according to zacks investment research estimates for freeport for secondquarter  have been going down of late freeport’s copper business is affected by supplyrelated issues and slowdown in china a major market moreover the company faces uncertainties surrounding the grasberg mine in indonesia it is also exposed to a volatile copper pricing environment prices of the metal are expected to remain under pressure in secondhalf  on concerns over an economic slowdown in china freeport has also underperformed the zacks categorized miningnon ferrous industry over the past six months   fbr  co analysts commented over the weekend another deadline has come and gone in freeports negotiations with the government of indonesia the lack of any apparent material progress over the course of this year and prior leads us to believe that either a sale andor arbitration are increasingly the most likely outcome in the prolonged dispute we believe that either path holds additional risks for freeport the more favorable scenarios in which freeport could continue to export concentrates while negotiations continue or a grand solution appear less likely now in our opinion an argument that a sale might be the best outcome for freeport is an acknowledgment that the company has few good options to choose from we are concerned that if discussions move towards a sale process investors will be paying close attention to the risk of value leakage given the unique regulatory circumstances in indonesia major questions would include how freeports assets are valued and how quickly freeport divests among others freeport can choose to go to arbitration around junejuly of this year which may be a catalyst for a mutually acceptable exit from indonesia   jefferies group llc analysts commented despite extensive negotiations freeport and indonesia have made little progress regarding conversion of freeports cow to an iupk local ownership of ptfi smelter development and longterm mining rights grasberg is operating at a reduced rate and the fcx investment case depends on a resolution to the dispute in this report we include a detailed analysis of freeports options and conclude that a sale of its stake in grasberg may be best   barclays plc analysts commented hold fcx shares for now we think that the market has bid up the stock to fair value in anticipation of a relatively quick resolution of the political overhang at grasberg  and a view that any lingering production disruption will end up as a net positive with fcx gaining more from a tighter copper market than it loses from a nearormedium term reduction in output remember fcx is effectively a pureplay copper mining stock at this point and at spot lb as of this writing copper has outrun our q fy global forecasts of lb and
