close privacy statement help help  support oddball stocks a true oddball mills music trust looking for value in the overlooked margins of the market pages home oddball stocks newsletter completebankdata you need an investing system here’s mine a true oddball mills music trust my goal when starting this blog was to find and profile companies far off the radar for most investors  i usually profile small caps netnets and a lot of foreign companies  for most investors bombarded by the mainstream financial media the things i write about are really offbeat  for investors who invest in deep value global small caps a lot of names i mention seem to be common  after all there are only so many stocks globally and there are a lot of people picking through them from time to time i uncover a truly oddball stock something that is both unknown and a different creature all together mills music definitely qualifies  i find these stocks interesting because due to complexity or details most investors pass over them  mills music trust qualifies as something hard to grasp yet has the markings of a good opportunity imagine a stock without any tangible assets or a book value  if it was liquidated it would be worth something yet there is no balance sheet  the income statement is seven lines long yes just seven lines  this is the quick description of mills music trust what is it  mills music is a cash collection and distribution machine  wheres the cash come from you ask  it comes from emi the music company  mills music owns the rights to some oldies songs nothing more nothing less  every time a royalty event happens with a song mills has the rights to emi makes a note and eventually sends over a royalty  four times a year mills music pays out the cash received from emi minus some bookkeeping fees to unit holders the business is simple enough cash in cash out  the simplicity is fascinating here is last years income statement a random thought i love the fact that they will keep less than  undistributed at the end of each year the first question to ask is why would anyone want to buy mills music trust  the answer is blindingly obvious for the yield of course  they have paid out  per share so far this year and have paid out between  and  over the past five years  the stock yields close to  currently  of course no one knows how much theyll pay out in the future because no one knows how many times the little drummer boy will be played on the radio this christmas either here is the historic dividend history there really isnt much else to say about mills music trust  in short old songs are played on the radio or downloaded in itunes and amazon the cash is sent to emi who sends it to mills music who sends it to you  mills has rights to over  songs but only about  songs actually generate royalties  the next copyright of a top income generating song expires in   amazingly  of the royalties comes from the top  songs  the rights mills music owns seem to be as obscure as the stocks i write about oldies are probably pretty stable at this point meaning the dividend is probably pretty stable until some of the songs start rolling off the copyright rights  for an almost  dividend this seems like a pretty safe bet purchase information mills music trust mmtrspk avg volume  shares use a limit order sec filings disclosure no position posted by nate tobik email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest  comments danmarch   at  amif you look carefully youll see that paul mccartney is the largest shareholderreplydeleterepliesnate tobikmarch   at  ami noticed that probably five minutes after i posted this its pretty safe to say that paul mccartney knows the value of rights so if he owns a lot he must see value in thisdeletereplyanonymousmarch   at  amthanks for the writeup nate wow only k units outstanding and an mil market cap teeny tiny so if i read this correctly unless the trust acquires new assets or copyright laws its copyrights will expire and revenues will gradually decrease over timeanyway sounds like a great business model easier than managing a building and collecting rentreplydeleterepliesnate tobikmarch   at  pmyoure right the trust will slowly distribute less and less cash eventually ending at zero the next expiration is in  and they slowly roll off after that i need to emphasize slowly copyrights last  years so for a song that came out in  youre looking at  before the copyright is done the ones rolling off now came out in quite a while agodeletereplythomas brazielmarch   at  amhey nate cool idea thanks for the post i dont mean to seem thick but how can you tell that paul mccarney is the largest shareholder thanks thomasreplydeleterepliesnate tobikmarch   at  ami saw it when i googled the company if you google mills music trust paul mccartney youll find a few articles mentioning that hes a major shareholder apparently there was a dispute back in  over how mills music calculated his dividendnatedeleteginbumapril   at  ami have owned mmtrs since  i have the prospectus from the  rights offering by utilities and industries corp the trusts expiration date is when the last descendant of john f kennedy diesdeleteanonymousoctober   at  pmginbum would you mind posting a copy of the prospectusdeletereplywexboymarch   at  amawesome post nate  thanks im sure mccartney hates that its called the mills music trustreplydeletekonradmarch   at  pmthe fact that they have an audit firm looking over the emi calculations is also a positive in my view if emi underpaid there is a potential windfall gain through a settlement if nothing comes out k wont hurt much the audit only started in nov  so it will likely be a while before we hear resultsreplydeletelorenzomarch   at  amarent the rights of the songs enough of an asset to make a balance sheetreplydeleterepliesnate tobikmarch   at  amlorenzoyes you could make a balance sheet but it really isnt necessary they pay out all of their cash except for  or so there are no liabilities outside of dividend payments to trust holderswith the music rights i think it would be hard to value them im sure they have some value but how do you carry that on the balance sheet most of the rights dont produce income so im not sure if they even have any value the best way to figure out an asset value is probably just a dividend discount on the present value of the cash flowsnatedeletereplyjarmmarch   at  amif my data is correct largest shareholders arempl communication mccartney  k sharesfirst eagle investment management  k sharesfirst manhattan company  k sharesreplydeleteyomahamarch   at  pmwhere can you see a list of songs that they own owning certain songs reminds me of something like coke where you own an intangible that is engrained in peoples minds so much so that it is nearly possible to untrench ie little drummer boyhow often if ever do they acquire rights to new musicreplydeleterepliesnate tobikmarch   at  pmi think the best way to find this out would be to call the trustee i found on wikipedia a listing of some of the top songs httpenwikipediaorgwikiwatersonberlinsnyderinci dont believe they ever buy new rights this is just a trust holding existing rights that eventually maybe in  or  years will just run outdeletegrossmismanagerapril   at  pmive done some research into this for whats its worth see my post from earlier today but dont bet the ranch on my conclusionsdeletejarrett rossmay   at  pmits quite simple all you have to do is use the ace search through ascap httpswwwascapcomhomeacetitlesearchindexaspx search for mills music under publishers and you will see about  results with about  or  being owned by the mills music trust all the emi mills music listings and i believe a few others if you click on these you will see all the songs they own deletereplyfilipemarch   at  amhi natemy take is one should value this with a dividend discount model its like a perpetuity the dividend has been in the same range  since at least but my question to you is what would be the appropriate discount rate for mills in your opinion would an eventual increase in interest rates cause the price of the stock to move downgreat findreplydeleteanonymousmarch   at  pmi have owned this stock for  years depending on which share you check i bought most at approx  dollars but so i could own a nice round number bought about  of them at  now i have always just counted the payments as dividends and thats it i never received any schedule ks or other papers to make things more difficult now i am poor so the irs doesnt care much but people on the yahoo discussion group seem to get all worried about the tax treatment i have heard enough to be confused even that i need pay no taxes until i have received my purchast price ha ha can i just continue as before the schedule k one the web is unreadable and what is readable is confusing as hellreplydeleteanonymousmarch   at  pmtop income generating song expires in  amazingly  of the royalties comes from the top  songsif i am understanding correctly their revenues decline about  following the loss of copyrights on their music rights inventory if that is the case each dividend is more like a return of capital not on capital and the stock at  is very unattractive in fact running numbers based on what i think are reasonable assumptions and taking into account that overhead is  centsshare i would not buy this until it was at least  for a  return because i dont know the expiration of the remaining  of revenues i need a high return hurdle this is a classic situation of a stock trading off of dividend yield until one day the dividend is cut and the stock plummets  have seen it happen time and time againreplydeleterepliestodd ericksonmarch   at  amthe yield overstates what youll actually earn the actual annual return for holding shares will be less because the distributions will fall over time eventually reaching zero investors would be better served calculating an internal rate of return irr to gauge realistic investment returns the irr is probably  at current prices  this scenario assumes distributions are stable until  begin falling in  as copyrights begin to expire and fade steadily until  when they cease as all copyrights will have expiredto get an irr of  you could only pay unit to receive an irr of  you could only pay unitif some of the top  hits expire closer to  then the actual irr would be lower than indicated also if administrative costs rise faster than royalties over time then the actual irr would be lower than suggested abovedeletereplyanonymousmarch   at  pmi am of the same view as the last two replies under no circumstance would i pay more than  for this you are not going to get your principal back and i would bet that distributions will diminish materially faster than a straight line assumption the reason is that the older these songs get the less they will be played sentimentality for songs can stretch over a generation or two eg an adult today remembers when she was  years old that her grandmother always played a certain song so she still likes it but they are not eternal thus not only will the number of songs earning royalties decline over time the royalties per song will also decline my guess is the only thing that kept the royalties relatively steady so far is that population growth and the internet have offset the decline in interest of the songs but the loss of interest will eventually win out and i dont think it will take  more years for most of this materialreplydeletegrossmismanagerapril   at  pmi bought some mmtrs a while back for a roth ira and have since communicated several times with the trustee hsbc in nyc in an effort to satisfy my curiosity about the list of copyrights held so far they havent released the original registration filing from  but they say theyre talking with emi in england to see about doing that the sec doesnt even have a copy of the filing because its so old their retention standards kicked inmeanwhile the most recent k does list what were apparently the  most lucrative titles over the past fiscal year they included among others little drummer boy sleigh ride star dust it dont mean a thing mood indigo ive got the world on a string aint misbehavin hold me thrill me kiss me red roses for a blue lady stars fell on alabama stormy weather st james infirmary shakin all over and youve got your troubleslast night i discovered an online database university of wisconsins i believe listing sheet music published by mills music over the years and i think its a reasonably safe bet that many of the titles are held by the trust less certain is when the various copyrights run out i made myself a list of the titles that intrigued me and there isnt space to share them all here so this is a partial summary from oldest  to newest   and please note i could be wrong about some or all of these copyright laws have changed frequently over the years both in the us and overseas records seem murky at best and it hasnt been unusual for various people to copyright the same or a slightly different tune at different timeswhos sorry now bye bye blackbird someone to watch over me me and my shadow button up your overcoat happy days are

irresponsible dominique do you hear what i hear on broadway girl from ipanema hello dolly its a small world king of the road thats lifethere are a lot of holiday songs esp christmas carols and show tunes among the titles associated with mills music as for the mccartney mpl ownership its worth noting that mills titles also include till there was you besame mucho dont get around much anymore aint she sweet accenttschuart the positive and bye bye blackbird – all of which mccartney has recorded at one point or another in his careerthere are also a handful of interesting post titles things like strangers in the night white rabbit mr bojangles sunshine of your love youve got a friend stairway to heaven and my sharona among others but i believe they are all considered part of new mills music and therefore their income is irrelevant to mmtrsreplydeletejarrett rossmay   at  pmi think everyone here would understand this company much better if they understood the true history of mills music publishing and if they understood music publishing in general first off when it comes to music rights it does not become public domain until  years after the death of the composersongwriter you can also find the whole catalogue owned by mills music by using the ace search through the ascap website httpswwwascapcomhomeacetitlesearchindexaspx as for understanding where all these songs came from here is the history of the company it was originally founded as jack mills music in  by jacks mills jack hired his cousin jack ecoff my greatgrandfather to be the general sales manager jack mills brother irving mills acted as vp and they eventually changed the name to mills music in  working out of  broadway blvd in new york they worked with many different songwriters and composers of the s acting as one of the few publishing companies who would sign black writers they had alberta hunter james p johnson fats waller duke ellington cab calloway and many other famous acts of the period signed to their catalogue they owned the rights to many famous tunes many of which have already been listed in these comments if you research jack mills or irving mills you will find a lot about their work and about the company i highly suggest looking through old billboard magazines which mention jack mills irving mills and jack ecoff quite often as they were figure heads of the music industry from the ss you can find a lot of this just through google search and google books search if you want to understand where all the money comes from for mmtrs then read up about the different licenses associated with music publishing rights these include mechanical licenses synchronization licenses print licenses and performance royalties also understand that each song is not owned outright by mills music because every song has two rights associated with it publishing rights and songwriter rights the most mills music can own of each song in its catalogue is  the other  is owner by the songwriterscomposers music publishing is the most complicated part of the music industry and something many have a hard time understanding how it works replydeleteadd commentload more newer post older
