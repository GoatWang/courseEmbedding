below entitled charges  credits for details nmnot meaningful schlumberger chairman and ceo paal kibsgaard commented “fourthquarter sequential revenue growth of  was driven by strong activity in the middle east and north america which was largely offset by continued weakness in latin america and seasonal activity declines in europe cis and africa “among the business segments the fourthquarter revenue increase was led by the production group which grew  due to increased hydraulic fracturing activity in the middle east and in north america land reservoir characterization group revenue increased  sequentially due to strong testing  process activity in kuwait that outweighed the seasonal decline in wireline activity in norway and russia drilling group revenue was flat sequentially as continued strong directional drilling activity in north america land was offset by activity declines in europecisafrica and middle east  asia cameron group revenue was also flat sequentially with growth in onesubsea and surface systems offset by reduced product sales from valves  measurement and from a declining order backlog in drilling systems “pretax operating margin was essentially flat sequentially at  as margin improvements in the production and drilling groups were balanced by contractions in the cameron and reservoir characterization groups in recent quarters we have managed to stabilize our business from an activity and capacity standpoint and this has subsequently allowed us to refine and reduce our support structure to reflect current activity and service pricing levels this has led us to record a  million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter we also recorded  million of charges relating to the cameron integration and a currency devaluation loss in egypt “we maintain our constructive view of the oil markets as the tightening of the supply and demand balance continued in the fourth quarter as seen by a steady draw in oecd stocks this trend was further strengthened by the december opec and nonopec agreements to cut production which should with a certain lag accelerate inventory draws support a further increase in oil prices and lead to increased ep investments “we expect the growth in investments to initially be led by land operators in north america where continued negative free cash flows seem less of a constraint as external funding is readily available and the pursuit of shorterterm equity value takes precedence over fullcycle return on investment ep spending surveys currently indicate that  nam ep investments will increase by around  led by the permian basin which should lead to both higher activity and a long overdue recovery in service industry pricing “in the international markets operators are more focused on fullcycle returns and ep investments are generally governed by the operators’ free cash flow generation based on this we expect the  recovery in the international markets to start off more slowly driven by the economic reality facing the ep industry this will likely lead to a third successive year of underinvestment with a continued low rate of new project approvals and an accelerating production decline in the aging production base these factors together are increasing the likelihood of a significant supply deficit in the medium term which can only be avoided by a broadbased global increase in ep spending which we expect will start unfolding in the later parts of  and leading into  “against this backdrop and following nine consecutive quarters of relentless workforce reductions cost cutting and restructuring efforts we are excited to restore focus on the pursuit of growth and improving returns as we navigated this downturn we have streamlined our cost and support structure continued to drive the underlying efficiency and quality of our business workflows expanded our offering through maintaining investments in re and made a series of strategic acquisitions the combination of these actions has enabled us to further strengthen our global market position during the downturn which will enable us to maintain and extend our well established margin and earnings leadership in both north america and in all parts of the international markets going forward “while earnings growth continues to be a very important financial driver for us fullcycle cash generation is even more critical and here we remain unique in the industry over the past two years of this downturn we have generated  billion in free cash flow which is more than the rest of our major competitors combined furthermore we have returned  billion to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks this clearly demonstrates the fullcycle robustness of schlumberger the careful management of our business and the strength of our executional capabilities” other events during the quarter schlumberger repurchased  million shares of its common stock at an average price of  per share for a total purchase

hydraulic fracturing activity as stage count increased and higher uptake of drilling  measurements bits  drilling tools and mi swaco products and services as rig count increased revenue on land in the us also posted doubledigit growth on higher activity and a modest pricing recovery while revenue in western canada grew strongly from a winter rampup in activity in addition to higher sales of artificial lift products revenue also increased from yearend westerngeco multiclient seismic license sales that were however muted when compared to prior years sales from valves  measurement and drilling systems declined international areas international revenue increased  sequentially led by strong growth in the middle east  asia area which was partially offset by continued weakness in the latin america area and seasonal activity declines in the europecisafrica area middle east  asia area revenue increased  sequentially this was mainly due to strong fracturing and integrated production services ips activity on unconventional land resource developments and increased productivity from land seismic crews in saudi arabia revenue in egypt increased from higher perforating while qatar

in the india geomarket as projects were completed and well campaigns delayed revenue in the latin america area declined  sequentially mainly in the mexico  central america geomarket where customer budget constraints led to a sharp drop in overall rig count that impacted onshore and offshore operations affecting both deepwater and shallowwater projects revenue in mexico also declined following the strong marine surveys and multiclient license seismic sales last quarter revenue in argentina decreased as unconventional resource development work was affected by unfavorable weather conditions and other delays these declines however were partially mitigated by strong drilling and project activity in the peru colombia  ecuador geomarket as the rig count increased by  following the rise in oil prices europecisafrica area revenue decreased  sequentially mainly due to the seasonal conclusion of peak summer drilling activity in russia and exploration services campaigns in norway that impacted all technologies led by wireline drilling  measurements and mi swaco the subsaharan africa geomarket contributed to the area revenue decline as rigs demobilized and projects were completed

uniform coupling in all directions acquisition began in  and will continue for approximately one year offshore norway wireline introduced a combination of technologies for lundin norway to overcome challenging formation geology and reduce operating time in a well in the barents sea the potential presence of large caves that were not visible via surface seismic imaging required the use of highresolution imaging in around and beyond the borehole technologies included the hdvs distributed acoustic sensing das system using a wireline cable with integrated optical fibers a ztrac downhole vibrator and a vsi versatile seismic imager all within a single toolstring the data acquired by having the vibrator and imager downhole enabled the customer to see potential hazards ahead of the drill bit and mitigate drilling risk the das technology reduced operating time to  minutes compared with conventional vsp acquisition that can require up to eight hours offshore the uae testing  process deployed a combination of technologies for al hosn gas in the hail and gasha fields the combination included an efiretcp tubingconveyed perforating electronic firing head and new perforation correlation technology both enabled by muzic wireless telemetry the wirelesslyenabled depth correlation was consistent with the traditional wireline gamma ray and casing collar locator method in addition realtime downhole data helped determine reservoir properties assessed well performance during and after stimulation and supported downhole sampling decisions to reduce the original well test

affected drilling  measurements and bits  drilling tools margin also expanded as a result of operational execution in ids mi swaco and bits  drilling tools and through continuing transformationrelated benefits as resources were aligned to match the shape of the recovery a combination of ids projects contract awards new technology deployments and transformation efficiencies contributed to drilling group performance in the fourth quarter in the gulf cooperation council gcc region ids delivered a  drilling performance improvement in the first three quarters of  compared with nonintegrated drilling services in similar fields the improvement is based on the feet drilled per hour below the rotary table this achievement was enabled by a combination of drilling technologies such as powerdrive archer high build rate and powerdrive xceed ruggedized rotary steerable systems to optimize drilling times in horizontal wells and during extended reach drilling this included the use of righour multiwell drilling operational efficiency analysis and ropo rate of penetration optimization software which adjusts drilling parameters to maximize onbottom drilling performance schlumberger combined these technologies with integrated workflows overseen by multidisciplinary domain experts in the saudi arabia and abu dhabi drilling technology integration centers to reduce both drilling and overall development costs in norway statoil awarded schlumberger an eightyear contract with optional periods to deliver integrated well construction services for one of its catj jackup rigs being

measurements used the geosphere reservoir mappingwhiledrilling service for exxonmobil to map a complex injectite reservoir and effectively geosteer into target sands in the balder field given two goals—avoid costly pilot holes in development wells that often failed to provide sufficient information to help land the producer wells and avoid setting the casing in thin injectite sands—geosphere technology mapped the top of the massive sands from more than  m total vertical depth above and detected the oilwater contact while landing the  ¼in section before penetrating the reservoir for the  ½in reservoir section the customer was able to plan a geosteering strategy ahead of the bit by combining seismic interpretation and geosphere mapping results and thus increased the productivity of the wells in west texas drilling  measurements used a combination of technologies to establish a new record in drilling performance for an operator in the permian basin the bottomhole assembly included powerdrive orbit rotary steerable systems to optimize directional drilling and a dynaforce highperformance drilling motor which provides the highest torque at the bit and outperforms conventional motors in highvolume drilling in addition slimpulse retrievable mwd service provided direction inclination toolface and gamma ray measurements in real time for mudpulse telemetry the customer drilled a ft lateral in less than  hours which surpassed the customer’s previous footage record in the permian basin by  as a result the customer reduced drilling time by  hours compared with a previous lateral in ecuador a drilling  measurements powerdrivex rotary steerable system with customized smith pdc bit technologies was deployed for orion energy to improve drilling performance in a well in the ocano field with remote support from experts at the drilling technology integration center the operations team drilled  ft of the in well section in  hours increasing the rate of penetration rop to  fthr compared with  fthr in similar wells a  net increase as a result the customer saved approximately  in drilling costs by completing the well section two days earlier than originally planned in egypt drilling  measurements used the geosphere reservoir mappingwhiledrilling service for belayim petroleum company petrobel a joint venture between egyptian general petroleum corporation and ieoc production bv to eliminate a pilot hole in the abu rudeis field an unconformity at the top of the oilbearing sandstone initially required a pilot hole to determine intermediate casing depth while pressurized shales above the target zone required a high mud weight that made penetration of the target sand challenging due to potential mud circulation losses geosphere technology used deep directional electromagnetic measurements to reveal subsurface bedding and fluid contact details more than  ft from the wellbore which helped manage the geological uncertainty and drilling risk by eliminating the pilot hole the customer saved approximately  million in russia bits  drilling tools used a combination of drillbit technologies for llc lukoilkomi a subsidiary production enterprise of pao lukoil to eliminate four bit trips and increase the rop in an offset well in the kyrtaelskoye field in the timanopechora region onyx  rolling pdc cutter technology increased bit durability due to its ° of rotation while stinger conical diamond elements provided superior impact strength and wear resistance in this hard and highly abrasive sand formation in addition due to its modular design the drilling  measurements powerpak steerable motor was customized to the drilling environment as a result the customer achieved an average rop of  mh a  increase compared with the maximum rop achieved in offset wells furthermore the customer saved five days of operations by drilling the  in section in  days instead of the expected  days in the neuquén basin in argentina mi swaco used klashield enhancedpolymer waterbase drilling fluid for wintershall argentina to drill a ft lateral in a challenging formation defined by abnormally high pore pressure natural fractures stresses and general

statements included or incorporated by reference in this news release may constitute forward looking statements under applicable securities legislation such forwardlooking statements or information typically contain statements with words such as anticipate believe expect plan intend estimate propose or similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook forwardlooking statements or information in this news release may include but are not limited to reserves estimates and the net present value of the future net reserves related thereto the number and quality of future potential drilling and development opportunities anticipated capital budgets and expenditures the companys development plan the size and extent of the michichi oil fairway and the timing of disclosure of further  guidance capital expenditure plans and well performance such forwardlooking statements or information are based on a number of assumptions all or any of which may prove to be incorrect in addition to any other assumptions identified in this document assumptions have been made regarding among other things the ability of the company to obtain equipment services and supplies in a timely manner to carry out its activities the ability of the company to market crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas successfully to current and new customers the ability to secure adequate product transportation the timely receipt of required regulatory approvals the ability of the company to obtain financing on acceptable terms interest rates regulatory framework regarding taxes royalties and environmental matters future crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas prices the ability to successfully integrate acquisitions into marquees business and managements expectations relating to the timing and results of development activities forwardlooking information is based on current expectations estimates and projections that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the company and described in the forwardlooking information material risk factors affecting the company and its business are contained in marquees annual information form which is available under marquees issuer profile on sedar at wwwsedarcom the forwardlooking information contained in this press release is made as of the date hereof and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forwardlooking information whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise unless required by applicable securities laws the forward looking information contained in this press release is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement drilling locations this press release discloses drilling locations in three categories i proved locations ii probable locations and iii unbooked locations proved locations and probable locations are derived from the companys most recent independent reserves report prepared by sproule as at december   and account for drilling locations that have associated proved andor probable reserves as applicable unbooked locations are internal estimates based on the companys prospective acreage and assumptions as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves of the  michichi drilling locations identified herein  are proved locations  are probable locations and the remaining  are unbooked locations unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of our multiyear drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic seismic engineering production and reserves information there is no certainty that the company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves or production the drilling locations on which the company will actually drill wells will ultimately depend upon the availability of capital regulatory approvals seasonal restrictions oil and natural gas prices costs actual drilling results additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors while certain of the unbooked drilling locations have been de  risked by drilling existing wells in relative close proximity to such unbooked drilling locations other unbooked drilling locations are farther away from existing wells where management has less information about the characteristics of the reservoir and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty that such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves or production nongaap financial measures this press release contains the term operating netbacks prior to hedging and operating netbacks which do not have standardized meanings prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures presented by other companies marquee uses operating netbacks to analyze operating performance marquee believes this benchmark is a key measure of profitability and overall sustainability for the company and this term is commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry operating netbacks are not intended to represent operating profits net earnings or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with ifrs operating netbacks prior to hedging are calculated by subtracting royalties production and operating and transportation expenses from revenues before other incomelosses operating netbacks include realized hedging gain loss this press release also contains the term funds flow from operations which should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with ifrs as an indicator of the companys performance funds flow from operations does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore reference to funds flow from operations or funds flow from operations per share may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures presented by other entities management uses funds flow from operations to analyze operating performance and leverage and considers funds flow from operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates the companys ability to generate cash necessary to fund future capital investments and to repay debt funds flow from operations per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares for the period in addition the press release contains the term net debt which does not have any standardized meaning under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers net debt is calculated as net debt defined as current assets less current liabilities excluding fair value of commodity contracts and flowthrough share premiums management considers net debt as an important additional measure to monitor debt repayment requirements and track the financial viability of the company additional advisories boes are presented on the basis of one boe for six mcf of natural gas disclosure provided herein in respect of boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of  mcf  bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of  utilizing a conversion on a  basis may be misleading as an indication of value this press release contains disclosure in respect of fd costs and fda costs which are considered oil and gas metrics within the meaning of ni  fd costs are calculated as the sum of development capital plus the change in future development capital for the period divided by the reserves additions for the period fda costs are calculated as the sum of development capital plus the change in future development capital and acquisition costs for the period divided by the reserves management uses fd costs as a measure to assess the performance of the companys resources required to locate and extract new hydrocarbon reservoirs the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year fda and fd costs used by marquee may not be comparable to similar measures used by other issuers neither the tsx venture exchange nor its regulation services provider as that term is defined in the policies of the tsx venture exchange accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release  end
