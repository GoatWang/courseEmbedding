provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition the discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto this section includes a number of forwardlooking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance forwardlooking statements are often identified by words like believe expect estimate anticipate intend project and similar expressions or words which by their nature refer to future events you should not place undue certainty on these forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions bang holdings corp was incorporated in the state of colorado on may   it is a brand management and digital advertising company that provides content and an influencerbased marketing network to the cannabis industry we are a developmentstage company and since our inception we have generated only minimal revenues from business operations our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion this means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business unless we obtain additional capital to pay our ongoing operational costs accordingly we must locate sources of capital to pay our operational costs our operational expenditures are primarily related to development of bangs multichannel advertising network marketing costs associated with attracting and retaining users and the costs related to being a fully reporting company with the securities and exchange commission  was a transformative year for bang holdings we quintupled the direct reach of our twentytoday network of channels over the course of the year to around  users and expanded the reach of our social influencer network to more than  million at five persons our core team has remained small and highly efficient and has built a firm foundation for growth in the quarters and years to come business overview bang holdings corp wholly owns two subsidiaries bang digital media a cannabis focused digital media company and bang vapor an ejuice company that can crossover to the cannabis market bang digital media is the hub for all cannabusiness related advertising content creation technology and marketing it consists of two divisions the multiplatform ttnetwork and a network of social media influencers that we call the green monkey network the ttnetwork is comprised primarily of specifically targeted audiences these are twentytoday vaporbang and ttv which cross the social media platforms of facebook twitter massroots instagram and youtube twentytoday is a digital multiplatform channel that enables us to target advertising for bang holdings products and services across social media platforms we currently have in excess of  users of our network with a steady growth rate of around two percent per week by continuing to create targeted quality content for this community on a daily basis twentytoday has for example created one of the most actively engaged marijuana pages on facebook this has built high levels of trust and goodwill in the community which will be convertible to revenues once we have reached a critical mass of users using the same skillset we are developing vaporbang  a digital multiplatform community for vaping enthusiasts at more than  strong ours is the largest vaping community on facebook this has enabled us to carry out beta testing of our product and to develop strong recognition for the bang brand while softlaunching our eliquid our most successful post on facebook in  had  million views leading to  reactions  shares and  comments the post was created to build upon our social media footprint related to our business not specifically towards our products the green monkey network is a network of social media influencers who are open to working as ambassadors in the marijuana industry these influencers expand the bang network by more than  million users ultimately the kpi of bang digital media is in the direct and expanded growth of our networks by continuing to grow twentytoday and the green monkey network to  million users we will have the digital reach to propel marijuanafriendly brands into the spotlight bang vapor is a marketer of vaporizer pens and eliquid for the vaporizer industry through the use of a razor and razor blade model electronic cigarettes or ecigs and vaporizers are batterypowered products that enable users to inhale nicotine vapor without smoke tar ash or carbon monoxide electronic cigarettes are comprised of three functional components bang vapor completed its soft launch in the first quarter of  plan of operations in the twelve month period we intend to develop our business in four areas � establish retail distribution with vaporizer shops and tobaccoheadshops there are between  vape shops that are dedicated exclusively to selling eliquid and vaporizer pens in addition there are approximately  tobacco shops or head shops that have historically only sold cigarettes tobacco and smoking pipes but is now offering various vaping products our sales team is currently establishing relationships with regional and national distributors and are attending trade shows in addition the company is currently advertising the products in trade publications and plans to expand these efforts will be attained in relation to the profits generated by the company we plan on targeting approximately  shops during our first year our estimated budget for this is approximately  � build partnerships with influential social media personalities and celebrities in several key genres to serve as brand ambassadors each brand ambassador will have their own affiliate website to sell bang products and make commissions off of each sale by giving a unique platform to youtubers and vine stars to monetize their social media followings bang vapor will be able to build brand awareness and employ an army of influencers to sell product in order to become a leading brand in the ecigvaporizer space compensation to social media personalities and celebrities will be bonus incentivized along with a commission structure therefore we anticipate no upfront expenditures � open the bang vapor club online distribution of our products purchased online is anticipated to be performed by the united states postal service we plan on maintaining a limited inventory of several flavor and two personal vapor lines we plan to expand the inventory line based upon the data we receive during the initial launch of the website the anticipated cost for completion of the website maintenance and the development of new features over the course of the next twelve  months is approximately  if we are unable to build our customer base or gain any clients we will be forced to cease our development andor marketing operations until we raise money attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult as such if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment we intend to raise additional capital through private placements now that we have a quotation on the otc bulletin board if we need additional cash but are unable to raise it we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely other than as described in this paragraph we have no other financing plans financing on august   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement with platinum partners liquid opportunity master fund lp platinum whereby the company issued  shares of common stock to the company at  per share for a purchase price of  in consideration for platinum agreeing to purchase the  shares the company agreed to issue to platinum share purchase warrants entitling platinum the right to acquire  shares of the companys common stock at  per share in october  platinum purchased the  convertible debenture for the aggregate amount of  on september   platinum exercised  warrants for cash proceeds of  on january   the related party exercised  warrants for cash proceeds of  on march   the related party exercised  warrants for cash proceeds of  subsequent to december   the companys president loaned the company  pursuant to a convertible debenture the loan bears interest at  per annum is due on january   and is convertible into common stock at  per share at the discretion of the holder in addition the company agreed to issue  warrants with an exercise price of  that expire january   results of operations for the year ended december   and for period from may   inception to december   we have generated  in revenue for the year ended december   compared to  for the period from may   inception to december   we incurred operating expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the period from may   inception to december   we had a net loss of  for the year ended december   a majority of which is general and administrative fees of  and sales and marketing fees of  compared to a net loss of  for the period from may   inception to december   a majority of which is general and administrative fees of  and interest expense of  liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis we have been funding our operations through the sale of our common stock our primary uses of cash have been for payroll marketing consulting legal accounting and audit fees the following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity in the near term � development of a company website � exploration of potential marketing and advertising opportunities and � the cost of being a public company our net revenues are not sufficient to fund our operating expenses at december   we had a cash balance of  since inception we raised  and  from the sale of warrants and a convertible debenture to platinum partners liquid opportunity master fund lp  from the sale of common stock through a private placement and  from the exercise of warrants to fund our operating expenses pay our obligations and grow our company we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures we may be required to raise additional funds particularly if we are unable to generate positive cash flow as a result of our operations we estimate that based on current plans and assumptions that our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations without further financing through june  other than working capital we presently have no other alternative source of working capital we may not have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations we may need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operating expenses pay our obligations and grow our company we do not anticipate we will be profitable in  therefore our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities obtaining credit facilities or other financing mechanisms however the trading price of our common stock and a downturn in the us equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities even if we are able to raise the funds required it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses fail to collect amounts owed to us or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing furthermore if we issue additional equity or debt securities stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock the inability to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations if we are unable to obtain additional financing we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations we anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future therefore our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of  and other rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission we expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly going concern for the year ended december   the company has incurred net operating losses and used cash in operations as of december   the company has an accumulated deficit of  and used cash in operations of  for the year ended december   losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for marketing of the companys products which included the general and administrative expenses associated with its organization and product development we currently have a burn rate of approximately  a month these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties management believes that the actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plan provides the opportunity for the company to continue as a going concern offbalance sheet arrangements we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december   critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates in financial statements the presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates during the period covered by these financial statements include the valuation of website costs valuation of deferred tax asset stock based compensation and any beneficial conversion features on convertible debt fair value measurements and fair value of financial instruments the company adopted fasb asc topic  fair value measurements asc topic  clarifies the definition of fair value prescribes methods for measuring fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data level inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information the company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with asc topic  due to the shortterm nature of all financial assets and liabilities their carrying value approximates their fair value as of the balance sheet date revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with fasb asc topic  revenue recognition in all cases revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured the company recognizes revenue when the products are shipped to the customers and collectability is reasonable assured recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued asu  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs this update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards the simplification initiative the board received feedback that having different balance sheet presentation requirements for debt issuance costs and debt discount and premium creates unnecessary complexity recognizing debt issuance costs as a deferred charge that is an asset also is different from the guidance in international financial reporting standards ifrs which requires that transaction costs be deducted from the carrying value of the financial liability and not recorded as separate assets additionally the requirement to recognize debt issuance costs as deferred charges conflicts with the guidance in fasb concepts statement no  elements of financial statements which states that debt issuance costs are similar to debt discounts and in effect reduce the proceeds of borrowing thereby increasing the effective interest rate concepts statement  further states that debt issuance costs cannot be an asset because they provide no future economic benefit to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years the adoption of this standard on january   did not have any effect on the financial statements in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  on presentation of financial statements going concern subtopic   disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern currently there is no guidance in us gaap about managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures the amendments in this update provide that guidance in doing so the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures the amendments require management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in us auditing standards specifically the amendments  provide a definition of the term substantial doubt  require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods  provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of managements plans in august  fasb issued asu no revenue from contracts with customers topic  deferral of the effective date defers the effective date asu no  for all entities by one year public business entities certain notforprofit entities and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in update  to annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period all other entities should apply the guidance in update  to annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after december   all other entities may apply the guidance in asu no  earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period all other entities also may apply the guidance in update  earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after december   and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the guidance in asu no  we are currently reviewing the provisions of this asu to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition recent accounting pronouncements issued by fasb including the emerging issues task force the aicpa and the sec did not or are not believed by the company management

is intensely competitive we compete with other sellers of electronic cigarettes personal vaporizers and eliquid flavors brands such as reynolds vuse group mark ten green smoke blu vaporfi njoy logic v and apollo all compete in the electronic cigarette market in the refillable personal hardware sector new competitors emerge constantly with brands like kangertech innokin joyetech sensei aspire tesla atmos and others constantly making their mark with new products as technology evolves in the eliquid flavor space the competition is even larger with new flavor brands emerging daily due to very low barriers to entry companies mentioned earlier like vaporfi atmos and njoy also carry their own flavor lines for the refillable market other brands like mount baker vapor focus on wide variety of choice and value while other brands like five pawns cosmic fog and suicide bunny carve out their identity with branding and more nuance flavor combinations the nature of our competitors is varied as the market is highly fragmented and the barriers to entry into the business are low we plan to compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors’ introduction of lowpriced products or innovative products cigarette excise taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price

common stock will go to the selling security holders we have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security holders the industry in which we conduct our business is intensely competitive we compete with other sellers of electronic cigarettes personal vaporizers and eliquid flavors brands such as reynolds vuse group mark ten green smoke blu vaporfi njoy logic v and apollo all compete in the electronic cigarette market in the refillable personal hardware sector new competitors emerge constantly with brands like kangertech innokin joyetech sensei aspire tesla atmos and others constantly making their mark with new products as technology evolves in the eliquid flavor space the competition is even larger with new flavor brands emerging daily due to very low barriers to entry companies mentioned earlier like vaporfi atmos and njoy also carry their own flavor lines for the refillable market other brands like mount baker vapor focus on wide variety of choice and value while other brands like five pawns cosmic fog and suicide bunny carve out their identity with branding and more nuance flavor combinations the nature of our competitors is varied as the market is highly fragmented and the barriers to entry into the business are low we plan to compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors’ introduction of lowpriced products or innovative products cigarette excise taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products company description bang vapor is a marketer of vaporizer pens and eliquid
