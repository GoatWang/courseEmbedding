vice president engineering  construction segment trimble wisconsin native bryn fosburgh is a surveyor with a long history in our business and an interesting story to tell although today he provides product guidance for one of the largest companies in our industry he didnt get there overnight and he credits a long line of mentors who influenced him along the way its always a pleasure to share success stories like fosburghs with our readers we caught up with him at his office in the new trimble facility in denver from maps to mentors born in tomah wisconsin yearold fosburgh grew up mostly in green bay wisconsin was a great place to grow up he told us his love of the outdoors provided many hours of hunting and fishing unable to afford college he joined the coast guard reserve where he was a hospital corpsman after his service he attended the university of wisconsin in green bay his appreciation for nature translated well to a degree in geology it was also at the university where bryn met his wife who has a degree in chemistry they have one daughter following graduation fosburgh became a manual cartographer with the defense mapping agency now nima in san antonio texas this was an era where cartographic artists airbrushed shaded relief maps and still drew everything by hand fosburgh did aerial interpretation and scribing on scribecoat on a light table a year later in 96 he knew he needed a change so when he noticed a job posting for a dma geodesist at cape canaveral in florida he applied the fosburghs moved to harbour beach near cocoa beach it was there that he met his first mentor bruce hanson son of wellrespected maryland surveyor rodney hanson hanson taught fosburgh survey observation and adjustment fundamentals he taught him how to set up a tripod and the basics of turning angles with a t and distance measurement with an hp 0 fosburgh recalls his first 6position azimuth which took about 6 hours and how hanson patiently recorded the observations and provided guidance over the next two years fosburgh¬†worked all over the cape obtaining a¬† wellrounded education on turning angle sets and performing astronomic observations to support the eastern test range which runs from maine to south africathe range is used for missile launches many of the observations were made from a bilby tower and some of the work was for the space shuttle program his work supported detachment  of the legendary geodetic survey squadron a highlevel air force survey team that works all over the world as part of his work fosburgh began running adjustments on a vax computer housed at fe warren air force base in cheyenne wyoming this awakened not only a love but a talent for math so he took a oneyear educational sabbatical and entered a masters program at purdue university in west lafayette indiana it was there that he met his second mentor the famous professor edward mikhail under mikhails guidance the oneyear geodesy and photogrammetry program exposed him to every adjustment course and the theory of edms a fork in the road the next logical step in his job with the dma would have involved moving to washington dc to return to cartography by this time the dma had progressed to automation but still his heart was not in it he did want to move to cheyenne but it wasnt an option at the time professor mikhail had introduced him to walt boge another purdue graduate who ran the usace etl engineering topographic lab now the usace topographic engineering center at fort belvoir in virginia the lab supports the corps of engineers with research on all aspects of mapping positioning and support of military warfighters fosburghs next career move therefore took him to ft belvoir it was at etl where he met a host of mentors including steve deloach ben remondi bill bergen and brian shannon deloach taught him how to use applications to solve needs deloach worked for the corps of engineers at belvoir followed by many years with earthdata he is currently employed by the smithsonian institution where he works on mapping and gis with ben remondi a highlyregarded expert in gps fosburgh became consumed with gps and its possibilities he learned from remondi to solve problems both theoretically and empirically using his c language programming skills he wrote a gps processing program remondis efforts placed etl at the forefront of rtk gps using it for such things as ship positioning and tide gauge monitoring bill bergen taught him how to determine the problem the customer is trying to solve and not attempt to apply technology for the sake of applying technology brian shannon showed him the practical aspects of using technology to solve engineering problems bryn spent four years at etl along with his wife who worked in etls hydrology group while there he took another sixmonth sabbatical as an adjunct instructor for gps in purdues civil engineering department by  the wisconsin natives were longing for home fosburgh took a job with the wisconsin dot as a civil engineer in madison under paul hartzheim wisconsin had one of the first harns in the country but hartzeim realized that to do rtk they were going to need better spacing together with fosburgh they wrote densification specs for primary secondary and tertiary control fosburgh was responsible for the daytoday operations of the gps survey and data processing group for wisdot but their stay in wisconsin didnt last long eighteen months later an opportunity arose for fosburgh to go to work for trimble in the sales organization it was there he met yet another mentor ed down fosburgh credits down with teaching him about sales and the necessity to support the customer at all costs during this time trimble was collaborating with caterpillar on machine control so the fosburghs moved to peoria illinois for a year and a half to work with mining and construction applications meanwhile jim sorden a vice president with trimble approached fosburgh with an opportunity to move to new zealand to manage trimbles survey software group according to fosburgh trimble had the first interoperable integrated software for gps and total stations the software group had been headquartered in new zealand since  when trimble acquired datacom software research ltd in order to offer new survey and mapping software products so in september  the fosburghs packed their suitcases again and moved to new zealand where he managed both the development of handheld and pc software and the applications engineering and testing groups by this time fosburgh had gained exposure to the field survey education research and development and sales still he credits yet another mentor joe paiva paiva who was the vice president of survey for trimble taught him how to manage people with a resultsoriented compassionate approach in october  paiva recommended fosburgh to take over as head of the survey group in january  the fosburghs returned to the united states one month later trimble ceo steve berglund decided that due the difficulty in hiring new people because of the high cost of living the survey group needed to move away from californias silicon valley the company considered portland san diego austin phoenix and sacramento before deciding on denver chosen for its central location airport hub and abundance of hightech workers berglund has been a mentor as well since  he has provided fosburgh with guidance on mergers and acquisitions market segmentation and the financial aspects of his current role in july of  trimble acquired spectraprecision which had already acquired geodimeter fosburgh credits longtime geodimeter chief karl ramstrom for the decision to create a single trimble brand for the survey market as we discussed the unified company bryn acknowledged that trimble previously was productdriven today it is marketdriven focusing more on strategy and fulfilling the needs of its customers after so many moves and so much traveling one might surmise that fosburgh is looking to slow down not so today he manages sales marketing rd and operations he still does an enormous amount of traveling managing trimbles survey and construction operations on a worldwide basis his daughter attends college in new zealand so when he can he combines business with pleasure to visit her with nearly 0 years in the survey industry myself and more than a decade as an editorsurveyor i have seen many changes at trimble one of the most important changes was its move toward hiring more surveyors in the early days trimble had a staff of approximately 0 surveyors but also relied on nonsurveyor engineers and product development people today trimble has more than  employees in the engineering  construction segment with more than 0 surveyors on staff worldwide resulting in products made by surveyors for surveyors that dont require a lot of changes after they are released in  trimbles revenue was 90 million the engineering  construction segment contributed 6 millionapproximately 6 percent of the companys revenues mentors inspire growth like fosburgh most of us can look back on our careers and give credit to individuals

after his service he attended the university of wisconsin in green bay his appreciation for nature translated well to a degree in geology it was also at the university where bryn met his wife who has a degree in chemistry they have one daughter following graduation fosburgh became a manual cartographer with the defense mapping agency now nima in san antonio texas this was an era where cartographic artists airbrushed shaded relief maps and still drew everything by hand fosburgh did aerial interpretation and scribing on scribecoat on a light table a year later in 96 he knew he needed a change so when he noticed a job posting for a dma geodesist at cape canaveral in florida he applied the fosburghs moved to harbour beach near cocoa beach it was there that he met his first mentor bruce hanson son of wellrespected maryland surveyor rodney hanson hanson taught fosburgh survey observation and adjustment fundamentals he taught him how to set up a tripod and the basics of turning angles with a t and distance measurement with an hp 0 fosburgh recalls his first 6position azimuth which took about 6 hours and how hanson patiently recorded the observations and provided guidance over the next two years fosburgh¬†worked all over the cape obtaining a¬† wellrounded education on turning angle sets and performing astronomic observations to support the eastern test range which runs from maine to south africathe range is used for missile launches many of the observations were made from a bilby tower and some of the work was for the space shuttle program his work supported detachment  of the legendary geodetic survey squadron a highlevel air force survey team that works all over the world as part of his work fosburgh began running adjustments on a vax computer housed at fe warren air force base in cheyenne wyoming this awakened not only a love but a talent for math so he took a oneyear educational sabbatical and entered a masters program at purdue university in west lafayette indiana it was there that he met his second mentor the famous professor edward mikhail under mikhails guidance the oneyear geodesy and photogrammetry program exposed him to every adjustment course and the theory of edms a fork in the road the next logical step in his job with the dma would have involved moving to washington dc to return to cartography by this time the dma had progressed to automation but still his heart was not in it he did want to move to cheyenne but it wasnt an option at the time professor mikhail had introduced him to walt boge another purdue graduate who ran the usace etl engineering topographic lab now the usace topographic engineering center at fort belvoir in virginia the lab supports the corps of engineers with research on all aspects of mapping positioning and support of military warfighters fosburghs next career move therefore took him to ft belvoir it was at etl where he met a host of mentors including steve deloach ben remondi bill bergen and brian shannon deloach taught him how to use applications to solve needs deloach worked for the corps of engineers at belvoir followed by many years with earthdata he is currently employed by the smithsonian institution where he works on mapping and gis with ben remondi a highlyregarded expert in gps fosburgh became consumed with gps and its possibilities he learned from remondi to solve problems both theoretically and empirically using his c language programming skills he wrote a gps processing program remondis efforts placed etl at the forefront of rtk gps using it for such things as ship positioning and tide gauge monitoring bill bergen taught him how to determine the problem the customer is trying to solve and not attempt to apply technology for the sake of applying technology brian shannon showed him the practical aspects of using technology to solve engineering problems bryn spent four years at etl along with his wife who worked in etls hydrology group while there he took another sixmonth sabbatical as an adjunct instructor for gps in purdues civil engineering department by  the wisconsin natives were longing for home fosburgh took a job with the wisconsin dot as a civil engineer in madison under paul hartzheim wisconsin had one of the first harns in the country but hartzeim realized that to do rtk they were going to need better spacing together with fosburgh they wrote densification specs for primary secondary and tertiary control fosburgh was responsible for the daytoday operations of the gps survey and data processing group for wisdot but their stay in wisconsin didnt last long eighteen months later an opportunity arose for fosburgh to go to work for trimble in the sales organization it was there he met yet another mentor ed down fosburgh credits down with teaching him about sales and the necessity to support the customer at all costs during this time trimble was collaborating with caterpillar on machine control so the fosburghs moved to peoria illinois for a year and a half to work with mining and construction applications meanwhile jim sorden a vice president with trimble approached fosburgh with an opportunity to move to new zealand to manage trimbles survey software group according to fosburgh trimble had the first interoperable integrated software for gps and total stations the software group had been headquartered in new zealand since  when trimble acquired datacom software research ltd in order to offer new survey and mapping software products so in september  the fosburghs packed their suitcases again and moved to new zealand where he managed both the development of handheld and pc software and the applications engineering and testing groups by this time fosburgh had gained exposure to the field survey education research and development and sales still he credits yet another mentor joe paiva paiva who was the vice president of survey for trimble taught him how to manage people with a resultsoriented compassionate approach in october  paiva recommended fosburgh to take over as head of the survey group in january  the fosburghs returned to the united states one month later trimble ceo steve berglund decided that due the difficulty in hiring new people because of the high cost of living the survey group needed to move away from californias silicon valley the company considered portland san diego austin phoenix and sacramento before deciding on denver chosen for its central location airport hub and abundance of hightech workers berglund has been a mentor as well since  he has provided fosburgh with guidance on mergers and acquisitions market segmentation and the financial aspects of his current role in july of  trimble acquired spectraprecision which had already acquired geodimeter fosburgh credits longtime geodimeter chief karl ramstrom for the decision to create a single trimble brand for the survey market as we discussed the unified company bryn acknowledged that trimble previously was productdriven today it is marketdriven focusing more on strategy and fulfilling the needs of its customers after so many moves and so much traveling one might surmise that fosburgh is looking to slow down not so today he manages sales marketing rd and operations he still does an enormous amount of traveling managing trimbles survey and construction operations on a worldwide basis his daughter attends college in new zealand so when he can he combines business with pleasure to visit her with nearly 0 years in the survey industry myself and more than a decade as an editorsurveyor i have seen many changes at trimble one of the most important changes was its move toward hiring more surveyors in the early days trimble had a staff of approximately 0 surveyors but also relied on nonsurveyor engineers and product development people today trimble has more than  employees in the engineering  construction segment with more than 0 surveyors on staff worldwide resulting in products made by surveyors for surveyors that dont require a lot of changes after they are released in  trimbles revenue was 90 million the engineering  construction segment contributed 6 millionapproximately 6 percent of the companys revenues mentors inspire growth like fosburgh most of us can look back on our careers and give credit to individuals
