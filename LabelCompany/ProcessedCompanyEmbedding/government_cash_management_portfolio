government securities the fund invests in may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the us government securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises are supported only by the credit of the issuing entity there is a risk that the value of an investment will decline if there is a default by or deterioration in the credit quality of the issuer or a provider of a credit enhancement or demand feature this could cause the fund’s nav to decline below  per share interest rate risk like the values of other debt instruments the market values of us government securities are affected by changes in interest rates when interest rates rise the market values of money market instruments decline this could cause the funds nav to decline below  per share liquidity risk the fund may be unable to sell a security promptly and at an acceptable price which could have the effect of decreasing the overall level of the funds liquidity market developments may cause the funds investments to become less liquid and subject to erratic price movements which may have an adverse effect on the funds ability to maintain a  share price market risk  the prices of the us government securities held by the fund may decline in response to certain events such as general economic and market conditions adverse political or regulatory developments interest rate fluctuations and those events directly involving the issuers  adverse market events may lead to increased redemptions which could cause the fund to experience a loss or difficulty in selling securities to meet redemptions or cause the fund’s nav to decline below  per share  the conversion of money market funds to “government money market funds” could lead to supply issues within the us treasury securities market as demand increases for us government securities repurchase agreement risk  if the seller in a repurchase agreement transaction defaults on its obligation to repurchase a security the fund may suffer delays incur costs and lose money in exercising its rights yield risk the yields received by the fund on its investments will decline as interest rates decline  ready to take the next step find an
