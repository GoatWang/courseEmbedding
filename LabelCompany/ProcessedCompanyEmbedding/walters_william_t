press to disguise the scheme they said the two men used disposable cellphones and created “a secret code” for discussing dean foods a dallas company referring to it as “the dallas cowboys”“davis breached his duty and broke the law as the result of being in dire financial straits” andrew j ceresney the head of the sec’s enforcement division said at a news conference on thursday and mr walters who was arrested at a resort in las vegas late wednesday was “gambling on a sure thing”the case however is much broader than a story about gambling debts the charges represent one of the most notable insider trading prosecutions since a federal appellate court overturned two prominent convictions — a ruling that led to the dismissal of about a dozen other convictionsafter the united states court of appeals for the second circuit overturned the convictions of two hedge fund managers todd newman and anthony chiasson in december  — and in the process imposed the greatest limits on prosecutors in a generation — the government predicted a chilling effect on future insider trading investigations preet bharara the united states attorney in manhattan who led a sweeping crackdown on insider trading warned that the ruling could allow “a potential bonanza for friends and family of rich people” advertisement continue reading the main story but in charging both mr walters and mr davis with securities fraud and wire fraud his office and the sec are sending a message that these cases can still be made“brazen insider trading continues to be a blot in our securities markets and so the integrity of our markets continues to be a priority for this office” mr bharara said at the news conference still he added that “there is conduct that we think is nefarious and undermines faith in the market and undermines the strength of the market that will not be able to be prosecuted because of the newman decision”mr walters’s lawyer said his client had done nothing wrong “bill walters is a true american success story whose extraordinary accomplishments as a lawful sports gambler have been widely recognized and lauded” the lawyer barry berke said in a statement “mr walters and his counsel look forward to his day in court”this is not the first time mr walters who is  has been the subject of a criminal investigation he has faced charges four times none of which resulted in a

against mr walters people briefed on the investigation have previously said once agents approached him on a golf course another time at an airport hangarat thursday’s news conference in lower manhattan the sec displayed a chart with the heading “mickelson’s trades in dean foods”gregory craig a lawyer for mr mickelson described the threetime winner of the masters golf tournament as “an innocent bystander”“phil understands and deeply respects the high professional and ethical standards that the companies he represents expect of their employees associates and of phil himself” mr craig said in a statement “he subscribes to the same values and regrets any appearance that on this occasion he fell short”through all the illicit trades that underpin the case against mr walters mr davis was the common thread photo phil mickelson was not accused of wrongdoing but the sec listed him in a civil complaint as a relief defendant credit jeff haynesreuters in addition to the  spinoff mr davis provided mr walters with “sneak previews” of at least six quarterly earnings statements for dean foods the sec saidauthorities say that mr davis also tipped mr walters to a notyetpublic activist

obstruction of justice because he “corruptly altered” and destroyed evidence in may  when news of the investigation first emerged mr davis resigned as chairman of dean foods last augustthomas m melsheimer a dallas lawyer representing mr davis said his client was “pleased to be assisting the government in its investigation”the case against mr walters comes as prosecutors reassess their ability to bring insider trading cases the appeals court ruling constrained the pursuit of cases involving the sharing of inside information between friends specifically the appeals court required “proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective consequential and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature”the case against mr walters addressed the issue of “pecuniary” gain headon the page indictment not only details mr walter’s longtime friendship with mr davis — they first met  years ago on a golf course — but that he had entered into numerous business deals and personal loans with himthey invested in a software company together mr walters arranged for a friend to provide mr davis with a  personal loan and as mr davis fell deeper into financial trouble mr walters helped bail him out with a  loan that was never repaid“it’s a straightforward announcement that the southern district is still in the insider trading prosecution business” said daniel richman a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at columbia law school “it’s also a reminder that however important newman is if the facts

walters was a skilled and fearless trader referred to by one of his brokers as “the babe ruth of risk” who did not need inside information mr davis mr walters’s lawyers said was trying to save himself by maligning mr waltersthe competing narratives were on display throughout the trial mr davis testified that he had acted as a “virtual conduit” of secrets and had supplied mr walters with an “enormous” amount of informationat one point mr davis said mr walters provided him with the bat phone to use while communicating about dean foods adding that later he had thrown it into a creek after

walters charged in manhattan federal court with insider trading thomas c davis former chairman of the board of directors of dean foods company has pled guilty to his role in the scheme and is cooperating with the government preet bharara the united states attorney for the southern district of new york diego rodriguez the assistant directorincharge of the new york field office of the federal bureau of investigation “fbi” and philip r bartlett inspectorincharge of the new york office of the us postal inspection service “uspis” announced the arrest of william t walters aka “billy” on charges of participating in a scheme from in or about  through in or about  to commit insider trading principally relating to securities of dean foods company “dean foods” or the “company”  in addition mr bharara announced the unsealing of charges against thomas c davis who pled guilty and admitted to his participation in the scheme earlier this week  on a number of occasions beginning in  davis who routinely possessed material nonpublic information through his service on the dean foods’ board of directors betrayed his duty of confidentiality to the company by providing this information to walters before it was publicly announced  as alleged in the charging documents walters in turn used the confidential information to execute profitable trades in dean foods that netted him realized and unrealized gains and avoided losses of more than  million  in exchange walters provided davis with substantial pecuniary benefits including among other things capital for joint business ventures and two loans of nearly  million that davis largely did not repay walters who is charged with conspiracy securities fraud and wire fraud was arrested yesterday in las vegas nevada and will be presented later today before a united states magistrate judge in the district of nevada  his case is before united states district judge p kevin castel in the southern district of new york  on monday davis pled guilty before judge castel to conspiracy securities fraud wire fraud obstruction of justice and perjury in a separate action the securities and exchange commission “sec” filed civil charges against walters and davis  us attorney preet bharara said “tom davis has admitted that over five years as a dean foods board member he repeatedly and systematically fed material nonpublic information about the company to billy walters who we allege benefited handsomely by trading on that information  with a direct channel into dean foods’ boardroom walters allegedly traded in advance of good news and bad news alike  as alleged it was all good news for walters because he had the information before everyone else – he had tomorrow’s headlines today  brazen insider trading continues to be a blot on our securities markets and so the integrity of our markets continues to be a priority for this office  when the board member of a fortune  company feeds inside information to a professional gambler who makes a fortune on welltimed trades in that company’s stock that is a form of corruption – the corruption of our markets  and we don’t let corruption stand  we intend to prove every one of these allegations in a court of law” fbi assistant directorincharge diego rodriguez said “trading on inside information for personal gain causes untold devastation in the stock and commodities markets this kind of criminal behavior keeps wealth concentrated among the powerful prevents everyday investors from turning a profit and undermines public confidence in the integrity of the marketplace  the fbi and our federal partners will continue to work to protect americans from the devastating consequences of these deceptive practices” uspis inspectorincharge philip r bartlett said “these individuals were more concerned with their ‘highroller’ image and the continuation of their lavish lifestyles than they were with adhering to fair and equitable investment regulations  this arrest should send a message to all that no matter how much money you accrue no one is above the law and all will be prosecuted equally for their illegal investment practices”    according to the allegations in the charging documents unsealed today in manhattan federal court including the indictment and statements made in court proceedings from in or about  through in or about  walters and davis among others

foods including about the company’s financial performance and results including quarterly earnings results contemplated and actual corporate transactions and other significant corporate and strategic developments the “inside information”  in furtherance of the scheme davis violated his duties of trust and confidence to dean foods by providing inside information to walters in advance of public announcements  walters knowing that davis owed duties of trust and confidence to the company used the inside information to execute profitable trades in dean foods stock  in total walters’s trading on the basis of inside information netted realized and unrealized profits of approximately  million and avoided additional losses of approximately  million  in return for davis providing the inside information to walters walters among other things provided capital to davis for joint business ventures and made two loans to davis for approximately  million in total which davis largely did not repay in furtherance of the scheme and to avoid detection by law enforcement walters provided davis with a prepaid cellular phone to use when passing inside information to walters  moreover walters further instructed davis to use code words when discussing the inside information including by referring to dean foods as the “dallas cowboys” specific examples of walters’s insider trading in dean foods on june   in an unanticipated announcement near the end of the second quarter dean foods informed the public that it had revised upwards its earnings guidance for that quarter  from june  to

approximately  million shares of dean foods stock thereby reestablishing his previous position in the stock at a reduction in cost of  million   in addition on or about may   davis provided inside

beauty and breadth of its collection more remarkable still is the fact that this collection was born of the artistic interest and publicmindedness of just two men william thompson walters and his son henry during the th and early th centuries the two baltimoreans assembled a diverse range of artwork from around the world—including everything from european master paintings and decorative arts to greek and roman antiquities and far eastern ceramics together they collected nearly  works of art and in doing so they built the foundation for a museum that offers a one of akind survey of  centuries of art today the collection has grown to more than  objects from ancient egyptian mummy masks and medieval armor to thcentury french impressionism and turnofthecentury art deco you will see significant works of art from around the world the walters redesigned galleries present the museum’s worldclass collections to their fullest potential our installations evoke the original manner in which the art was displayed and in turn provide greater insights into the art and a more personal and rewarding viewer experience william  henry walters william thompson walters was born on may   in the small mining town of liverpool pennsylvania the first of eight children william was brought up with little education and little chance at commercial success in search of a better life he moved to the economically booming center of baltimore at the age of  he entered the wholesale liquor trade but also prospered through investments in east coast railroads at age  he married ellen harper together the couple had three children william jr who died in early childhood henry born in  and jennie born in  following the lead of other prosperous baltimoreans william moved his wife and children from the crowded downtown area to the fashionable parklike setting of  mount vernon place now  west mount vernon place at the dawn of the civil war william who had mixed loyalties thought it best to take his family away from the united states they arrived in paris in the summer of  during this time he and his wife started acquiring european works of art from artists dealers and exhibitions throughout france switzerland italy and england william and ellen began building the collection that would become the museum we have today sadly tragedy struck the walters family shortly after they arrived in europe while on a trip to london in november  ellen contracted pneumonia and died quickly at the age of  william perhaps to console himself turned to collecting with even more vigor at the end of the war in  he returned to baltimore with his children in the spring of  in his first attempt to bring art to the public william opened his house to visitors every wednesday in april and may charging a cent admission fee which he donated to the baltimore association for the improvement in the condition of the poor these openings became an annual event in  and were eagerly anticipated by baltimores residents when william died in  he bequeathed his collection to his son henry walters would not only follow in his fathers footsteps in business—investing and managing railroads—but would carry on the family interest in art as well he greatly expanded the scope of acquisitions including his astounding purchase of the contents of a palace in rome that contained over  pieces this acquisition added roman and etruscan antiquities early italian paintings and renaissance and baroque works of art to his holdings although he spent little time in his native city henry continued the work his father had begun by opening his collection to the public in  he bought three houses on charles street adjoining a property he already owned henry had the site transformed into a palazzolike building which opened to the public in  he died in  bequeathing the building and its contents to the mayor and city council of baltimore for the benefit of the public the walters art gallery now the
