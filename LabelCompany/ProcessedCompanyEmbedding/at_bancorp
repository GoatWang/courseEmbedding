addition to being insured by the fdic checking accounts let you transfer money by check or electronic payment to a person or organization that you designate as payee but remember the interest you earn from bank products—including certificates of deposit cds—tends to be lower than potential returns from other investments types of accounts savings accounts these insured deposit accounts which pay interest give you the flexibility to make as many deposits as you like whenever you like they tend to have more withdrawal restrictions than checking accounts and higher minimum deposits money market accounts money market accounts also are deposit accounts giving you the safety convenience and liquidity of a savings account plus a slightly higher interest rate they typically have limited check
