risk in the market is fundamental that’s why within the stadion flex target date cit series portfolios there are three key components equity fixed income and “flex”—the portion that we actively manage portfolio components equity persistent equity exposure provides broad market exposure large cap mid cap small cap and international periodically adjusts holdings based on shifts within the markets example can add exposure to emerging markets flex tactical asset allocation strategy drives portfolio allocation dynamic sell criteria adjusts equity exposure as determined by our model example this

fixed income allocation increases in the early years stadion manages the flex component with an emphasis on aggressive market exposure over time we manage the flex portion with an increasingly

changing economic political or market conditions which may reduce the value of the portfolio inflationdeflation inflation may cause the present value of future payments to decrease causing a decline in the future value of assets or income deflation causes prices to decline throughout the economy over time impacting issuers’ creditworthiness and increasing their risk for default which may reduce the value of the portfolio active management performance is subject to the risk that the advisor’s investment strategies are not suited to achieving the investment objective or do not perform as expected which may cause the portfolio to lose value or underperform investments with similar objectives and strategies portfolio turnover engaging in active trading may create high portfolio turnover or a turnover of  or more resulting in increased transaction costs exchange traded funds assets invested in etfs generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities they are designed to track although they may be subject to greater liquidity risks and higher costs than owning the underlying securities directly due to their management fees underlying fund also known as fund of funds or subsidiary a portfolio’s risks are closely associated with the risks of the securities and other investments held by the underlying funds and the ability of the portfolio to meet its investment objective likewise depends on the ability of the underlying funds to meet their objectives fixed income securities the value of assets invested in fixedincome or debt securities may be susceptible to general movements in the bond market and are subject to increased interest rate and credit risk equity securities the value of equity securities which include common preferred and convertible preferred stocks will fluctuate based on changes in their issuers’ financial conditions as well as overall market and economic conditions and can decline in the event of deteriorating issuer market or economic conditions foreign securities assets invested in foreign securities may be subject to increased volatility as the value of these securities changes more rapidly and extremely than the value of us securities foreign securities are subject to increased issuer risk since foreign issuers may not experience the same degree of regulation as us issuers and are held to different reporting accounting and auditing standards in addition foreign securities are subject to increased costs since there are generally higher commission rates on transactions transfer taxes higher custodial costs and the potential for foreign tax charges on dividend and interest payments many foreign markets are relatively small and securities issued in less developed countries face the risks of nationalization expropriation or confiscatory taxation and adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations including suspension of the ability to transfer currency from a country political changes or diplomatic developments can also negatively impact performance emerging markets assets invested in emerging market securities may be subject to a greater extent to market credit

comparative performance results shown for the sp  index and the sp target date index series demonstrate how the us stock and bond markets performed generally during the same periods and how a hypothetical investment in either market alone or the asset mixes shown would have performed during such periods  the sp target date index series is composed of eleven multiasset class indices each corresponding to a particular target retirement date the asset class mix for each index is determined once a year through a process designed to reflect the overall investment opportunity of the represented markets  each index is fully investable with varying levels of exposure to equities and fixed income to create its target date benchmark sp indices conducts an annual survey of target date funds each year in april funds are required by the sec to report their holdings quarterly at the time of the annual index review it was the most recent quarterly holdings data for each fund in its survey the overall process is as follows funds are identified as target date funds from the morningstar or lipper databases and sorted by asset size fund families not meeting the minimum asset threshold of us   million are removed from consideration fund holdings are drawn from the latest period available using commercial databases and the sec’s edgar web site asset class exposures for the funds are derived by mapping the fund holdings to their corresponding asset class category in cases where surveyed funds hold balanced or other multiasset class funds sp indices look through to the underlying asset allocation of these funds to determine their net effect on the asset allocation of the surveyed fund it is not possible to invest directly in indexes which are unmanaged and do not incur fees or charges asset classes currently represented in the series are large mid and smallcap us equities developed international equities emerging market equities us reits core fixed income
