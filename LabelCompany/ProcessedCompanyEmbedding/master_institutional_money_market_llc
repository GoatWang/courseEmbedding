average maturity of  days or less and a dollarweighted average life of all of its investments of  days or less the dollarweighted average maturity of a portfolio is the average amount of time until the issuers of the debt securities in the portfolios portfolio must pay off the principal amount of the debt dollarweighted means the larger the dollar value of a debt security in a portfolio the more weight it gets in calculating this average to calculate the dollarweighted average maturity the portfolio may treat a variable or floating rate security under certain circumstances as having a maturity equal to the time remaining to the securitys next interest rate reset date rather than the securitys actual maturity dollarweighted average life of a portfolios portfolio is calculated without reference to the exceptions used in calculating the dollarweighted average maturity for variable or floating rate securities regarding the use of interest rate reset dates        pursuant to rule a each portfolio is subject to a general liquidity requirement that requires that each portfolio hold securities that are sufficiently liquid to meet reasonably foreseeable interestholder redemptions in light of its obligations under section e of the investment company act regarding share redemptions and any commitments the portfolio has made to interestholders to comply with this general liquidity requirement blackrock must consider factors that could affect the portfolios liquidity needs including characteristics of the portfolios investors and their likely redemptions depending upon the volatility of its cash flows particularly shareholder redemptions this may require a portfolio to maintain greater liquidity than would be required by the daily and weekly minimum liquidity requirements discussed below   a table of contents      each portfolio will not acquire any illiquid securities ie securities that cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven days at approximately the value ascribed to them by the portfolio if immediately following such purchase more than  of the portfolios total assets are invested in illiquid securities each portfolio will not acquire any security other than a daily liquid asset unless immediately following such purchase at least  of its total assets would be invested in daily liquid assets and each portfolio will not acquire any security other than a weekly liquid asset unless immediately following such purchase at least  of its total assets would be invested in weekly liquid assets daily liquid assets include i cash ii direct obligations of the us government iii securities that will mature as determined without reference to the maturity shortening provisions of rule a

strategies in addition to the principal strategies discussed above the portfolios may also invest or engage in the following investmentsstrategies        affiliated money market funds  each

which are securities that cannot be offered for public resale unless registered under the applicable securities laws or that have a contractual restriction that prohibits or limits their resale ie rule a securities restricted securities may include private placement securities that have not been registered under the applicable securities laws restricted securities may not be listed on an exchange and may have no active trading market and therefore may be considered to be illiquid rule a securities are restricted securities that can be resold to qualified institutional buyers but not to the general public and may be considered liquid securities        securities lending  each portfolio may lend securities with a value up to   of its total assets to financial institutions that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the us government as collateral c risks risk is inherent in all investing the value of an investment in a portfolio as well as the amount of return received on an investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time an investment in a portfolio may not perform as well as other similar investments interestholders could lose money by investing in a portfolio although each portfolio seeks to preserve the value of an investment at  per share it cannot guarantee it will do so an investment in a portfolio is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency the portfolios sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to a portfolio and interestholders should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to a portfolio at any time the following is a description of certain risks of investing in the portfolios set forth below are the principal risks of investing in the portfolios        credit risk  credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security owned by the portfolio will not be able to make principal and interest payments when due changes in an issuers credit rating or the markets perception of an issuers creditworthiness may also affect the value of the portfolios investment in that issuer the degree of credit risk depends on both the financial condition of the issuer and the terms of the obligation        income risk  the portfolios yield will vary as the shortterm securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds are reinvested in securities with different interest rates        interest rate risk  interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a debt security may fall when interest rates rise in general the market price of debt securities with longer maturities will go up or down more in response to changes in interest rates than the market price of shorterterm securities additionally securities issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity however due to fluctuations in interest rates the market value of such securities may vary during the period interestholders own interests of the portfolio        market risk and selection risk  market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the portfolio invests will go down in value including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by portfolio management will underperform the markets the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies this means you may lose money   a table of contents      regulatory risk  on july   the securities and exchange commission the sec adopted amendments to money market fund regulations which structurally change the way that certain money market funds will be required to operate the effect of these amendments on an individual money market fund will depend on the type of investors eg retail or institutional and the principal investments of the fund for example institutional money market funds will be required to sell and redeem fund shares using a floating net asset value and may at the discretion of the funds board of trustees impose fees on shareholder redemptions and temporarily suspend redemptions if the funds weekly liquid assets fall below a certain threshold retail money market funds may impose fees and suspend redemptions but may continue to sell and redeem shares at a constant net asset value whereas government money market funds are exempt from these structural changes the compliance periods for the amendments range between july  and october  when implemented the changes may affect the portfolios investment strategies fees and expenses portfolio and share liquidity and return potential        repurchase agreement risk  if the other party to a repurchase agreement defaults on its obligation under the agreement the portfolio may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement if the seller fails to repurchase the security and the market value of the security declines the portfolio may lose money        treasury obligations risk  treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates maturities times of issuance and other characteristics direct obligations of the us treasury have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity however due to fluctuations in interest rates the market value of such securities may vary during the period interestholders own interests in the portfolio        us government obligations risk  obligations of us government agencies authorities instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity however not all us government securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states obligations of certain agencies authorities instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises of the us government are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states eg the government national mortgage association other obligations are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury eg the federal home loan banks and others are supported by the discretionary authority of the us government to purchase an agencys obligations still others are backed only by the credit of the agency authority instrumentality or sponsored enterprise issuing the obligation no assurance can be given that the us government would provide financial support to any of these entities if it is not obligated to do so by law        variable and floating rate instrument risk  the absence of an active market for these instruments could make it difficult for the portfolio to dispose of them if the issuer defaults        whenissued and delayed delivery securities and forward commitments risk  whenissued and delayed delivery securities and forward commitments involve the risk that the security that the portfolio buys will lose value prior to its delivery there also is the risk that the security will not be issued or that the other party to the transaction will not meet its obligation if this occurs the portfolio may lose both the investment opportunity for the assets it has set aside to pay for the security and any gain in the securitys price each portfolio may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments and investment strategies including        borrowing risk  borrowing may exaggerate changes in the net asset value of portfolio interests and in the yield on the portfolios portfolio borrowing will cost the portfolio interest expense and other fees the cost of borrowing money may reduce the portfolios return borrowing may cause the portfolio to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations        expense risk  portfolio expenses are subject to a variety of factors including fluctuations in the portfolios net assets accordingly actual expenses may be greater or less than those indicated for example to the extent that the portfolios net assets decrease due to market declines or redemptions the portfolios expenses will increase as a percentage of portfolio net assets during periods of high market volatility these increases in the portfolios expense ratio could be significant        investment in other investment companies risk  as with other investments investments in other investment companies are subject to market and selection risk in addition   a table of contents   if the portfolio acquires shares of investment companies shareholders bear both their proportionate share of expenses in the portfolio including management and advisory fees and indirectly the expenses of the investment companies        liquidity risk  liquidity risk refers to the possibility that it may be difficult or impossible to sell certain positions at an acceptable price        securities lending risk  securities lending involves the risk that the borrower may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at all as a result the portfolio may lose money and there may be a delay in recovering the loaned securities the portfolio could also lose money if it does not recover the securities andor the value of the collateral falls including the value of investments made with cash collateral these events could trigger adverse tax consequences for the portfolio d portfolio

reduce certain transaction costs to the extent that contributions to and redemptions from the portfolios portfolio by the various feeder funds may offset each other and produce a lower net cash flow a feeder funds investment in the corresponding portfolio may however be adversely affected by the actions of other feeder funds for example if a large feeder fund reduces its investment in a portfolio or withdraws from a portfolio the remaining feeder funds may bear higher pro rata operating expenses however this possibility also exists for traditionally structured funds with large investors a feeder fund might also withdraw from the corresponding portfolio if the portfolio voted to change its investment objective policies or limitations in a manner not acceptable to the board of that feeder fund the withdrawal of all of a feeder funds assets from the corresponding portfolio may affect the investment performance of the feeder fund and the portfolio the master llc normally

not involve any public offering within the meaning of section a of the  act investments in the master llc may only be made by a limited number of institutional investors including investment companies common or commingled trust funds group trusts and certain other accredited investors within the meaning of regulation d under the  act this registration statement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security within the meaning of the  act there is no minimum initial or subsequent investment in the master llc however because each portfolio

other transaction costs to convert the securities to cash the master llc has elected however to be governed by rule f under the investment company act so that the master llc is obligated to redeem its interests solely in cash up to the lesser of  or  of its net asset value during any day period for any interestholder of the master llc the redemption price is the net asset value per share next

otherwise permitted by the investment company act if an emergency exists investments in the master llc may not be transferred without the prior written consent of all directors and all remaining interestholders b fund reorganizations not applicable c offering price not applicable   b table of contents item  taxation of the master llc the master llc is organized as a delaware limited liability company under the anticipated method of operation of the series each portfolio will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a separate entity that will have the status of a partnership pursuant to treasury regulation section b or if it has only one feeder fund as an entity the existence of which separate from its feeder fund is disregarded for federal income tax purposes thus none of the portfolios will be subject to any federal income tax based on the status of each portfolio as a partnership or disregarded entity each investor in a portfolio will include in its gross income its share as determined in accordance with the governing instruments of the portfolio of such portfolios ordinary income capital gains losses deductions and credits in determining its federal income tax liability the determination of such share will be made in accordance with the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and treasury regulations promulgated thereunder the master llcs taxable yearend is april  although the portfolios will not be subject to federal income tax they will file appropriate federal income tax returns it is intended that each portfolios assets income and distributions will be managed in such a way that an investor in the portfolio will be able to satisfy the requirements of subchapter m of the code for qualification as a regulated investment company ric assuming that the investor invested all of its investable assets in the portfolio any prospective feeder fund which is a ric agrees that for purposes of determining its required distribution under code section a it will account for its share of items of income gain loss deduction and credit of the corresponding portfolio as they are taken into account by the portfolio each portfolio is to be managed in compliance with the provisions of the code applicable to rics as though such requirements were applied at the portfolio level thus consistent with its investment objectives each portfolio will meet the income and diversification of assets tests of the code applicable to rics certain transactions and investments of a portfolio are subject to special tax rules of the code that may among other consequences a affect the character of realized gains and losses b disallow suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions or c accelerate the recognition of income without a corresponding receipt of cash with which to make distributions necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements applicable to rics operation of these rules could affect the character amount and timing of income and of distributions to the feeder funds special tax rules also require a portfolio to mark to market certain types of positions in its portfolio ie treat them as sold on the last day of the taxable year and may result in the recognition of income without a corresponding receipt of cash each portfolio intends to monitor transactions make appropriate tax elections and make appropriate entries in its books and records to reduce the effect of these tax rules and avoid disqualifying the feeder fund as a ric under the code a portfolio that invests in obligations of nonus issuers such as premier institutional portfolio and institutional portfolio may be subject to taxes imposed on interest income paid by nonus issuers and withheld at the source the united states has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries that may entitle a portfolio to a reduced rate of tax or an exemption from tax on such income it is impossible to determine in advance the effective rate of foreign tax because the amount of assets to be invested in foreign countries is not known the code requires a ric to pay a nondeductible  excise tax to the extent that
