reference to the price at which the common stock was last sold or the average bid and asked price of such common stock as of the last business day of the registrant’s most recently completed second

 as quoted on the otc pink sheets of the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” there were  shares of common voting stock held by nonaffiliates valued in the aggregate at    outstanding

references to “bear lake recreation inc” “bear lake” the “company” “we” “us” “our” and words of similar import refer to bear lake recreation inc the registrant   this annual report contains certain forwardlooking statements and for this purpose any statements contained in this annual report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forwardlooking statements  without limiting the foregoing words such as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” “anticipate” “estimate” or “continue” or comparable terminology are intended to identify forwardlooking statements  these statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors many of which are not within our control  these factors include but are not limited to economic conditions generally and in the endeavors in which we may participate competition within our chosen industry technological advances and failure by us to successfully develop business relationships among others   part i   item   business   business development   bear lake recreation inc was organized under the laws of the state of nevada on october   with an initial authorized capital consisting of  shares of  par value common voting stock   our initial operations consisted of renting snowmobiles and allterrain vehicles atv’s we had also planned on organizing snowmobile rental packages which would have included lodging at ideal beach resort at bear lake utah on or about october  we abandoned the snowmobile atv and lodging plans our lack of success was attributed to entering the marketplace comprising this endeavor during a year that was the beginning of a drought cycle resulting in below average snowfall and competitive growth from one to three selfpromoting developmental properties our operations ceased due to depleted capital resources resulting from offering vacation packages lacking in demand   on june   we entered into a licensing agreement with alcorp an oregon limited liability company to purchase the right to manufacture use market and sell the “netcaddy” a backpack style bag used to transport fishing gear by the end of the first quarter of  we had also abandoned the “net caddy” operations we realized only minimal sales through our ecommerce site and  number infomercial advertisements additionally due to the exhaustion of our capital resources we could no longer maintain the infrastructure required for sales promotion while faced with limited consumer demand        all computations herein take into account a one for three and onehalf  for  share reverse split of our outstanding shares of common stock that was effective on or about october   and which is discussed below under this heading   the following is a summary of material business developments since our inception   ·  shares of our common stock were issued to our principal founder at inception for services valued at  · completed the offer and sale of approximately  shares of our common stock to public investors under rule  of regulation d of the securities and exchange commission the “sec” in march  for aggregate consideration of  · completed the offer and sale of approximately  shares of our common stock to persons who were “accredited investors” under rule  of regulation d in july and august  for aggregate consideration of  · issued our three directors and executive officers a total of approximately  approximately  shares each to todd l albiston wayne bassham and derrick albiston for services valued at an aggregate consideration of  in september  · issued the same three directors and executive officers a total of approximately  approximately  shares each for services valued at an aggregate consideration of  in september  · our common stock was granted quotations on the otc bulletin board “otcbb” on or about december   and we were assigned a trading symbol of “blkr” · on march   we amended section  of our bylaws to allow for written action to be taken without a meeting by less than all of the stockholders · amended and restated our articles of incorporation effective in april   the amended and restated articles of incorporation were unanimously adopted by our board of directors who then also constituted our majority stockholders collectively beneficially owning approximately  shares of our common stock or approximately  of our outstanding voting securities as board members and stockholders no other votes were required or necessary to adopt the amendments to our articles of incorporation and none were solicited  the following is a summary of the material changes to our articles of incorporation i five million  shares of preferred stock with a par value of  per share were authorized ii the minimum number of our directors was reduced to one iii our board of directors was authorized to change our name in certain circumstances without stockholder approval and iv our board of directors was authorized to effect recapitalizations in the form of forward or reverse splits in certain circumstances without a stockholder approval  we filed a definitive information statement with the sec on march   · we effected a one for three and onehalf  for  share reverse split of our outstanding shares of common stock that was effective on or about october   and our then otcbb trading symbol was changed to “blke” on or about october    all share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split   we have had no material business operations since  when we began the search for the acquisition of assets property or business that may benefit us and our stockholders   description of business   we are currently seeking and investigating potential assets property or businesses to acquire  we have had no material business operations for about eight years  our plan of operation for the next  months is to i consider guidelines of industries in which we may have an interest ii adopt a business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected industry and iii to commence such operations through funding andor the acquisition of a “going concern” engaged in any industry selected  we are unable to predict the time as to when and if we may actually participate in any specific business endeavor and will be unable to do so until we determine any particular industry in which we may engage   we are not currently engaged in any substantive business activity except the search for potential assets property or businesses to acquire and we have no current plans to engage in any other activity in the foreseeable future unless and until we complete any such acquisition  in our present form we are deemed to be a vehicle to acquire or merge with a business or company  we do not intend to restrict our search for business opportunities to any particular business or industry and the areas in which we will seek out business opportunities or acquisitions reorganizations or mergers may include all lawful businesses  we recognize that the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to us may be extremely limited and may be restricted as to acquisitions reorganizations and mergers with businesses or entities that desire to avoid what such entities may deem to be the adverse factors related to an initial public offering “ipo” as a method of going public  the most prevalent of these factors include substantial time requirements legal and accounting costs the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to publicly offer and sell shares the lack of or the inability to obtain the required financial statements for such an undertaking state limitations on the amount of      dilution to public investors in comparison to the stockholders of any such entities along with other conditions or requirements imposed by various federal and state securities laws rules and regulations and federal and state agencies that implement such laws rules and regulations   amendments to form k by the sec regarding shell companies and transactions with shell companies that require the filing of all information about an acquired company that would have been required to have been filed had any such company filed a form  with the sec along with required audited interim and proforma financial statements within four business days of the closing of any such transaction item a of form k and the recent amendments to rule  adopted by the sec that were effective on february   limit the resale of most securities of shell companies until one year after the filing of such information may eliminate many of the perceived advantages of these types of going public transactions  these types of transactions are customarily referred to as “reverse” reorganizations or mergers in which the acquired company’s shareholders become controlling shareholders in the acquiring company and the acquiring company becomes the successor to the business operations of the acquired company  regulations governing shell companies also deny the use of form s for the registration of securities and limit the use of this form to a reorganized “shell company” until the expiration of  days from when any such entity is no longer considered to be a shell company  this prohibition could further restrict opportunities for us to acquire companies that may already have stock option plans in place that cover numerous employees  in such instances there may be no exemption from registration for the issuance of securities in any business combination to these employees thereby necessitating the filing of a registration statement with the sec to complete any such reorganization and incurring the time and expense that are normally avoided by reverse reorganizations or mergers     recent amendments to rule  adopted by the sec and effective on february   codify the sec’s prior position limiting the tradability of certain securities of shell companies including those issued by us in any acquisition reorganization or merger and further limit the tradability of additional securities of shell companies these proposals will further restrict the availability of opportunities for us to acquire any business or enterprise that desire to utilize us as a means of going public     any of these types of transactions regardless of the particular prospect would require us to issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock that could amount to as much as  of our outstanding voting securities following the completion of any such transaction accordingly investments in any such private enterprise if available would be much more favorable than any investment in us   management intends to consider a number of factors prior to making any decision as to whether to participate in any specific business endeavor none of which may be determinative or provide any assurance of success  these may include but will not be limited to as applicable an analysis of the quality of the particular business or entity’s management and personnel the anticipated acceptability of any new products or marketing concepts that any such business or company may have the merits of any such business’ or company’s technological changes the present financial condition projected growth potential and available technical financial and managerial resources of any such business or company working capital history of operations and future prospects the nature of present and expected competition the quality and experience of any such business’ or company’s management services and the depth of management the business’ or the company’s potential for further research development or exploration risk factors specifically related to the business’ or company’s operations the potential for growth expansion and profit of the business or  company the perceived public recognition or acceptance of the company’s or the business’ products services trademarks and name identification and numerous other factors which are difficult if not impossible to properly or accurately quantify or analyze let alone describe or identify without referring to specific objective criteria of an identified business or company   regardless the results of operations of any specific entity may not necessarily be indicative of what may occur in the future by reason of changing market strategies plant or product expansion changes in product emphasis future management personnel and changes in innumerable other factors  further in the case of a new business venture or one that is in a research and development mode the risks will be substantial and there will be no objective criteria to examine the effectiveness or the abilities of its management or its business objectives  also a firm market for its products or services may yet need to be established and with no past track record the profitability of any such entity will be unproven and cannot be predicted with any certainty   management will attempt to meet personally with management and key personnel of any entity providing any potential business opportunity afforded to us visit and inspect material facilities obtain independent analysis or verification of information provided and gathered check references of management and key personnel and conduct other reasonably prudent measures calculated to ensure a reasonably thorough review of any particular business opportunity however due to time constraints of management these activities may be limited     we are unable to predict the time as to when and if we may actually participate in any specific business endeavor  we anticipate that proposed business ventures will be made available to us through personal contacts of directors executive      officers and principal stockholders professional advisors broker dealers in securities venture capital personnel and others who may present unsolicited proposals  in certain cases we may agree to pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who submit a potential business endeavor in which we eventually participate such persons may include our directors executive officers and beneficial owners of our securities or their affiliates in this event such fees may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential venture and accordingly may present a conflict of interest for such individuals  management does not presently intend to acquire or merge with any business enterprise in which any member has a prior ownership interest   our directors and executive officers have not used any particular consultants advisors or finders on a regular basis   although we currently have no plans to do so depending on the nature and extent of services rendered we may compensate members of management in the future for services that they may perform for us  because we currently have extremely limited resources and we are unlikely to have any significant resources until we have determined a business or enterprise to engage in or have completed a reorganization merger or acquisition management expects that any such compensation would take the form of an issuance of shares of our common stock to these persons this would have the effect of further diluting the holdings of our other stockholders  there are presently no preliminary agreements or understandings between us and members of our management respecting such compensation  any shares issued to members of our management would be required to be resold under an effective registration statement filed with the sec or  months after we file the “form  information” about the acquired company with the sec as now required by form k these provisions could further inhibit our ability to complete the acquisition of any business or complete any merger or reorganization with another entity where finders or others who may be subject to these resale limitations refuse to provide us with any introductions or to close any such transactions unless they are paid requested fees in cash or unless we agree to file a registration statement with the sec that includes any shares that are to be issued to them at no cost to them  these expenses could limit potential acquisition candidates especially those in need of cash resources and could affect the number of shares that our stockholders retain following any such transaction by reason of the increased expense   substantial fees are also often paid in connection with the completion of all types of acquisitions reorganizations or mergers ranging from a small amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars or more these fees are usually divided among promoters or founders or finders after deduction of legal accounting and other related expenses and it is not unusual for a portion of these fees to be paid to members of management or to principal stockholders as consideration for their agreement to retire a portion of their shares of our common stock that are owned by them or to provide an indemnification for all of our prior liabilities  management may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of all or any portion of their shares of common stock as a condition to or in connection with a proposed reorganization merger or acquisition  it is not anticipated that any such opportunity will be afforded to other stockholders or that such other stockholders will be afforded the opportunity to approve or consent to any particular stock buyout transaction  in the event that any such fees are paid or shares are purchased these requirements may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential acquisition or merger by us and accordingly may also present a conflict of interest for such individuals we have no definitive arrangements or understandings respecting any of these types of fees or opportunities  any of these types of fees that are paid in shares of our common stock will also be subject to the resale limitations embodied in the recent amendments to rule    our directors and executive officers are evaluating potential merger targets but as of the date of this report no definitive plans for a merger are in force   principal products or services and their markets   none not applicable   distribution methods of the products or services   none not applicable   status of any publicly announced new product or service   none not applicable   competitive business conditions and smaller reporting company’s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition   management believes that there are literally thousands of shell companies engaged in endeavors similar to those engaged in by us many of these companies have substantial current assets and cash reserves  competitors also include thousands of other publiclyheld companies whose business operations have proven unsuccessful and whose only viable business      opportunity is that of providing a publiclyheld vehicle through which a private entity may have access to the public capital markets via a reverse reorganization or merger  there is no reasonable way to predict our competitive position or that of any other entity in these endeavors however we having limited assets and no cash reserves will no doubt be at a competitive disadvantage in competing with entities that have significant cash resources and have recent operating histories when compared with the complete lack of any substantive operations by us since    sources and availability of raw materials and names of principal suppliers   none not applicable   dependence on one or a few major customers   none not applicable   patents trademarks licenses franchises concessions royalty agreements or labor contracts including duration   none not applicable   need for any governmental approval of principal products or services   because we currently have no business operations and produce no products nor provide any services we are not presently subject to any governmental regulation in this regard  however in the event that we complete a reorganization merger or acquisition transaction with an entity that is engaged in business operations or provides products or services we will become subject to all governmental approval requirements to which the reorganized merged or acquired entity is subject or may become subject   effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business   emerging growth company   we may be deemed to be an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  or “jobs act”  as long as we remain an emerging growth company we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company”   under the jobs act emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies   we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years although we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” prior to such time if we have more than  billion in annual revenue more than  million in market value of our common stock is held by non “affiliates” or we issue more than  billion of nonconvertible debt over a threeyear period   smaller reporting company   we are subject to the reporting requirements of section  of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” and we are subject to the disclosure requirements of regulation sk of the sec as a “smaller reporting company”   that designation will relieve us of some of the informational requirements of regulation sk   sarbanesoxley act   we are also subject to the sarbanesoxley act of   the sarbanesoxley act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence  it also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies establishes clear statutory rules to limit       and to expose to public view possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors management assessment of our internal controls prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud among other provisions compliance with the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs   exchange act reporting requirements   section a of the exchange act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to section g of the exchange act to comply with the rules and regulations of the sec regarding proxy solicitations as outlined in regulation a matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in schedules a or c of regulation  preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the sec at least  days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our stockholders   we are required to file annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q with the securities exchange commission on a regular basis and are required to timely disclose certain material events eg changes in corporate control acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy in a current report on form k   research and development costs during the last two fiscal years   none not applicable   cost and effects of compliance with environmental laws   we do not believe that our current or intended business operations are subject to any material environmental laws rules or regulations that would have an adverse material effect on our business operations or financial condition or result in a material compliance cost however we will become subject to all such governmental requirements to which the reorganized merged or acquired entity is subject or may become subject   number of total employees and number of fulltime employees   none   additional information   you may read and copy any materials that we file with the sec at the sec’s public reference room at  f street ne washington dc   you may also find all of the reports or registration statements that we have previously filed electronically with the sec at its internet site at wwwsecgov  please call the sec at  for further information on this or other public reference rooms  our sec reports and registration statements are also available from commercial document retrieval services such as cch washington service bureau whose telephone number is    part ii   item a  risk factors   not required for smaller reporting companies   item   properties   we have no assets property or business our principal executive office address and telephone number are the business office address and telephone number of a stockholder duane s jenson and are currently provided at no cost because we have had no business our activities have been limited to keeping itself in good standing in the state of nevada and timely voluntarily filing our reports with the sec these activities have consumed an insignificant amount of management’s time accordingly the costs to mr jenson of providing the use of his office and telephone have been minimal        item   legal proceedings   we are not a party to any pending legal proceeding to the knowledge of our management no federal state or local governmental agency is presently contemplating any proceeding against us no director executive officer or affiliate of ours or owner of record or beneficially of more than

conjunction with the reverse split finra changed our trading symbol “blkr” to “blke”  there is currently no established trading market for shares of our common stock  management does not expect any viable market to develop in our common stock unless and until we complete an acquisition or merger in any event no assurance can be given that any market for our common stock will develop or be maintained   for any market that develops for our common stock the sale of “restricted securities” common stock pursuant to rule  of the sec by members of management or any other person to whom any such securities may be issued in the future may have a substantial adverse impact on any such public market  for information regarding the requirements of resales under rule  see the heading “rule ”

 forward looking statements   in this annual report references to “bear lake recreation inc” “bear lake” the “company” “we” “us” “our” and words of similar import refer to bear lake recreation inc the registrant   this annual report contains certain forwardlooking statements and for this purpose any statements contained in this annual report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forwardlooking statements  without limiting the foregoing words such as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” “anticipate” “estimate” or “continue” or comparable terminology are intended to identify forwardlooking statements  these statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors many of which are not within our control  these factors include but are not limited to economic conditions generally and in the endeavors in which we may participate competition within our chosen industry technological advances and failure by us to successfully develop business relationships among others   part i   item   business   business development   bear lake recreation inc was organized under the laws of the state of nevada on october   with an initial authorized capital consisting of  shares of  par value common voting stock              our initial operations consisted of renting snowmobiles and allterrain vehicles atv’s we had also planned on organizing snowmobile rental packages which would have included lodging at ideal beach resort at bear lake utah on or about october  we abandoned the snowmobile atv and lodging plans our lack of success was attributed to entering the marketplace comprising this endeavor during a year that was the beginning of a drought cycle resulting in below average snowfall and competitive growth from one to three selfpromoting developmental properties our operations ceased due to depleted capital resources resulting from offering vacation packages lacking in demand   on june   we entered into a licensing agreement with alcorp an oregon limited liability company to purchase the right to manufacture use market and sell the “netcaddy” a backpack style bag used to transport fishing gear by the end of the first quarter of  we had also abandoned the “net caddy” operations we realized only minimal sales through our ecommerce site and  number infomercial advertisements additionally due to the exhaustion of our capital resources we could no longer maintain the infrastructure required for sales promotion while faced with limited consumer demand   all computations herein take into account a one for three and onehalf  for  share reverse split of our outstanding shares of common stock that was effective on or about october   and which is discussed below under this heading   the following is a summary of material business developments since our inception   ·    shares of our common stock were issued to our principal founder at inception for services valued at  ·   completed the offer and sale of approximately  shares of our common stock to public investors under rule  of regulation d of the securities and exchange commission the “sec” in march  for aggregate consideration of  ·   completed the offer and sale of approximately  shares of our common stock to persons who were “accredited investors” under rule  of regulation d in may  for aggregate consideration of  ·   issued our three directors and executive officers a total of approximately  approximately  shares each to todd l albiston wayne bassham and derrick albiston for services valued an aggregate consideration of  in september  ·   issued the same three directors and executive officers a total of approximately  approximately  shares each for services valued at an aggregate consideration of  in september  ·   our common stock was granted quotations on the otc bulletin board “otcbb” on or about december   and we were assigned a trading symbol of “blkr” ·   on march   we amended section  of our bylaws to allow for written action to be taken without a meeting by less than all of the stockholders ·   amended and restated our articles of incorporation effective in april   the amended and restated articles of incorporation were unanimously adopted by our board of directors who then also constituted our majority stockholders collectively beneficially owning approximately  shares of our common stock or approximately  of our outstanding voting securities as board members and stockholders no other votes were required or necessary to adopt the amendments to our articles of incorporation and none were solicited  the following is a summary of the material changes to our articles of incorporation i five million  shares of preferred stock with a par value of  per share were authorized ii the minimum number of our directors was reduced to one iii our board of directors was authorized to change our name in certain circumstances without stockholder approval and iv our board of directors was authorized to effect recapitalizations in the form of forward or reverse splits in certain circumstances without a stockholder approval  our definitive information statement which was filed with the sec on march   is filed as an exhibit to this annual report  see part iv item  ·   we effected a one for three and onehalf  for  share reverse split of our outstanding shares of common stock that was effective on or about october   and our otcbb trading symbol was changed to “blke” on or about october                ·   on october   we announced the execution of a letter of intent to acquire vault technologies inc an alberta technology corporation which was subsequently amended on november  and december   and which expired on january     we have had no material business operations since  we have begun the search for the acquisition of assets property or business that may benefit us and our stockholders   description of business   we are currently seeking and investigating potential assets property or businesses to acquire  we have had no material business operations for about eight years  our plan of operation for the next  months is to i consider guidelines of industries in which we may have an interest ii adopt a business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected industry and iii to commence such operations through funding andor the acquisition of a “going concern” engaged in any industry selected  we are unable to predict the time as to when and if we may actually participate in any specific business endeavor and will be unable to do so until we determine any particular industry in which we may engage   we are not currently engaged in any substantive business activity except the search for potential assets property or businesses to acquire and we have no current plans to engage in any other activity in the foreseeable future unless and until we complete any such acquisition  in our present form we are deemed to be a vehicle to acquire or merge with a business or company  we do not intend to restrict our search for business opportunities to any particular business or industry and the areas in which we will seek out business opportunities or acquisitions reorganizations or mergers may include all lawful businesses  we recognize that the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to us may be extremely limited and may be restricted as to acquisitions reorganizations and mergers with businesses or entities that desire to avoid what such entities may deem to be the adverse factors related to an initial public offering “ipo” as a method of going public  the most prevalent of these factors include substantial time requirements legal and accounting costs the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to publicly offer and sell shares the lack of or the inability to obtain the required financial statements for such an undertaking state limitations on the amount of dilution to public investors in comparison to the stockholders of any such entities along with other conditions or requirements imposed by various federal and state securities laws rules and regulations and federal and state agencies that implement such laws rules and regulations   amendments to form k by the sec regarding shell companies and transactions with shell companies that require the filing of all information about an acquired company that would have been required to have been filed had any such company filed a form  with the sec along with required audited interim and proforma financial statements within four business days of the closing of any such transaction item a of form k and the recent amendments to rule  adopted by the sec that were effective on february   limit the resale of most securities of shell companies until one year after the filing of such information may eliminate many of the perceived advantages of these types of going public transactions  these types of transactions are customarily referred to as “reverse” reorganizations or mergers in which the acquired company’s shareholders become controlling shareholders in the acquiring company and the acquiring company becomes the successor to the business operations of the acquired company  regulations governing shell companies also deny the use of form s for the registration of securities and limit the use of this form to a reorganized shell company until the expiration of  days from when any such entity is no longer considered to be a shell company  this prohibition could further restrict opportunities for us to acquire companies that may already have stock option plans in place that cover numerous employees  in such instances there may be no exemption from registration for the issuance of securities in any business combination to these employees thereby necessitating the filing of a registration statement with the sec to complete any such reorganization and incurring the time and expense that are normally avoided by reverse reorganizations or mergers   recent amendments to rule  adopted by the sec and effective on february   codify the sec’s prior position limiting the tradeability of certain securities of shell companies including those issued by us in any acquisition reorganization or merger and further limit the tradeability of additional securities of shell companies these proposals will further restrict the availability of opportunities for us to acquire any business or enterprise that desire to utilize us as a means of going public            any of these types of transactions regardless of the particular prospect would require us to issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock that could amount to as much as  of our outstanding voting securities following the completion of any such transaction accordingly investments in any such private enterprise if available would be much more favorable than any investment in us   management intends to consider a number of factors prior to making any decision as to whether to participate in any specific business endeavor none of which may be determinative or provide any assurance of success  these may include but will not be limited to as applicable an analysis of the quality of the particular business or entity’s management and personnel the anticipated acceptability of any new products or marketing concepts that any such business or company may have the merits of any such business’ or company’s technological changes the present financial condition projected growth potential and available technical financial and managerial resources of any such business or company working capital history of operations and future prospects the nature of present and expected competition the quality and experience of any such business’ or company’s management services and the depth of management the business’ or the company’s potential for further research development or exploration risk factors specifically related to the business’ or company’s operations the potential for growth expansion and profit of the business or  company the perceived public recognition or acceptance of the company’s or the business’ products services trademarks and name identification and numerous other factors which are difficult if not impossible to properly or accurately quantify or analyze let alone describe or identify without referring to specific objective criteria of an identified business or company   regardless the results of operations of any specific entity may not necessarily be indicative of what may occur in the future by reason of changing market strategies plant or product expansion changes in product emphasis future management personnel and changes in innumerable other factors  further in the case of a new business venture or one that is in a research and development mode the risks will be substantial and there will be no objective criteria to examine the effectiveness or the abilities of its management or its business objectives  also a firm market for its products or services may yet need to be established and with no past track record the profitability of any such entity will be unproven and cannot be predicted with any certainty   management will attempt to meet personally with management and key personnel of any entity providing any potential business opportunity afforded to us visit and inspect material facilities obtain independent analysis or verification of information provided and gathered check references of management and key personnel and conduct other reasonably prudent measures calculated to ensure a reasonably thorough review of any particular business opportunity however due to time constraints of management these activities may be limited   we are unable to predict the time as to when and if we may actually participate in any specific business endeavor  we anticipate that proposed business ventures will be made available to us through personal contacts of directors executive officers and principal stockholders professional advisors broker dealers in securities venture capital personnel and others who may present unsolicited proposals  in certain cases we may agree to pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who submit a potential business endeavor in which we eventually participate such persons may include our directors executive officers and beneficial owners of our securities or their affiliates in this event such fees may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential venture and accordingly may present a conflict of interest for such individuals  management does not presently intend to acquire or merge with any business enterprise in which any member has a prior ownership interest   our directors and executive officers have not used any particular consultants advisors or finders on a regular basis   although we currently have no plans to do so depending on the nature and extent of services rendered we may compensate members of management in the future for services that they may perform for us  because we currently have extremely limited resources and we are unlikely to have any significant resources until we have determined a business or enterprise to engage in or have completed a reorganization merger or acquisition management expects that any such compensation would take the form of an issuance of shares of our common stock to these persons this would have the effect of further diluting the holdings of our other stockholders  there are presently no preliminary agreements or understandings between us and members of our management respecting such compensation  any shares issued to members of our management would be required to be resold under an effective registration statement filed with the sec or  months after we file the form  information about the acquired company with            the sec as now required by form k  these provisions could further inhibit our ability to complete the acquisition of any business or complete any merger or reorganization with another entity where finder’s or others who may be subject to these resale limitations refuse to provide us with any introductions or to close any such transactions unless they are paid requested fees in cash or unless we agree to file a registration statement with the sec that includes any shares that are to be issued to them at no cost to them  these expenses could limit potential acquisition candidates especially those in need of cash resources and could affect the number of shares that our stockholders retain following any such transaction by reason of the increased expense   substantial fees are also often paid in connection with the completion of all types of acquisitions reorganizations or mergers ranging from a small amount to as much as  or more these fees are usually divided among promoters or founders or finders after deduction of legal accounting and other related expenses and it is not unusual for a portion of these fees to be paid to members of management or to principal stockholders as consideration for their agreement to retire a portion of their shares of our common stock that are owned by them or to provide an indemnification for all of our prior liabilities  management may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of all or any portion of their shares of common stock as a condition to or in connection with a proposed reorganization merger or acquisition  it is not anticipated that any such opportunity will be afforded to other stockholders or that such other stockholders will be afforded the opportunity to approve or consent to any particular stock buyout transaction  in the event that any such fees are paid or shares are purchased these requirements may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential acquisition or merger by us and accordingly may also present a conflict of interest for such individuals we have no present arrangements or understandings respecting any of these types of fees or opportunities  any of these types of fees that are paid in shares of our common stock will also be subject to the resale limitations embodied in the recent amendments to rule    none of our directors executive officers founders or their affiliates or associates has had any negotiations with any representatives of the owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition reorganization merger or other business opportunity with us   principal products or services and their markets   none not applicable   distribution methods of the products or services   none not applicable   status of any publicly announced new product or service   none not applicable   competitive business conditions and small or reporting company’s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition   management believes that there are literally thousands of shell companies engaged in endeavors similar to those engaged in by us many of these companies have substantial current assets and cash reserves  competitors also include thousands of other publiclyheld companies whose business operations have proven unsuccessful and whose only viable business opportunity is that of providing a publiclyheld vehicle through which a private entity may have access to the public capital markets via a reverse reorganization or merger  there is no reasonable way to predict our competitive position or that of any other entity in these endeavors however we having limited assets and no cash reserves will no doubt be at a competitive disadvantage in competing with entities that have significant cash resources and have recent operating histories when compared with the complete lack of any substantive operations by us since               sources and availability of raw materials and names of principal suppliers   none not applicable   dependence on one or a few major customers   none not applicable   patents trademarks licenses franchises concessions royalty agreements or labor contracts including duration   none not applicable   need for any governmental approval of principal products or services   because we currently have no business operations and produce no products nor provide any services we are not presently subject to any governmental regulation in this regard  however in the event that we complete a reorganization merger or acquisition transaction with an entity that is engaged in business operations or provides products or services we will become subject to all governmental approval requirements to which the reorganized merged or acquired entity is subject or may become subject   effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business    smaller reporting company   we are subject to the reporting requirements of section  of the exchange act and we are subject to the disclosure requirements of regulation sk of the sec as a “smaller reporting company”   that designation will relieve us of some of the informational requirements of regulation sk    sarbanesoxley act   we are also subject to the sarbanesoxley act of   the sarbanesoxley act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence  it also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies establishes clear statutory rules to limit and to expose to public view possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors management assessment of our internal controls auditor attestation to management’s conclusions about internal controls prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud among other provisions compliance with the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs    exchange act reporting requirements   section a of the exchange act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to section g of the exchange act to comply with the rules and regulations of the sec regarding proxy solicitations as outlined in regulation a matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in schedules a or c of regulation  preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the sec at least  days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to the our stockholders              we are required to file annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q with the securities exchange commission on a regular basis and are required to timely disclose certain material events eg changes in corporate control acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy in a current report on form k   research and development costs during the last two fiscal years   none not applicable   cost and effects of compliance with environmental laws   we do not believe that our current or intended business operations are subject to any material environmental laws rules or regulations that would have an adverse material effect on our business operations or financial condition or result in a material compliance cost however we will become subject to all such governmental requirements to which the reorganized merged or acquired entity is subject or may become subject   number of total employees and number of full time employees   none   additional information   you may read and copy any materials that we file with the sec at the sec’s public reference room at  f street ne washington dc   you may also find all of the reports or registration statements that we have previously filed electronically with the sec at its internet site at wwwsecgov   please call the sec at  for further information on this or other public reference rooms  our sec reports and registration statements are also available from commercial document retrieval services such as cch washington service bureau whose telephone number is    part ii   item a  risk factors   not required for smaller reporting companies   item   properties   we have no assets property or business our principal executive office address and telephone number are the business office address and telephone number of a stockholder duane s jenson and are currently provided at no cost because we have had no business our activities have been limited to keeping itself in good standing in the state of nevada and timely voluntarily filing our reports with the sec these activities have consumed an insignificant amount of management’s time accordingly the costs to mr jenson of providing the use of his office and telephone have been minimal   item   legal proceedings   we are not a party to any pending legal proceeding to the knowledge of our management no federal state or local governmental agency is presently contemplating any proceeding against us no director executive officer or affiliate of ours or owner of record or beneficially of more than  of our common stock is a party adverse to us or has a material interest

conjunction with the reverse split nasdaq changed our trading symbol “blkr” to “blke”  there is currently no established trading market for shares of our common stock of  management does not expect any viable market to develop in our common stock unless and until we complete an acquisition or merger in any event no assurance can be given that any market for our common stock will develop or be maintained   for any market that develops for our common stock the sale of “restricted securities” common stock pursuant to rule  of the sec by members of management or any other person to whom any such securities may be issued in the future may have a substantial adverse impact on any such public market  for information regarding the requirements of resales under rule  see the heading “rule ”

shell companies   “i  unavailability to securities of issuers with no or nominal operations and no or nominal noncash assets               this section is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by an issuer defined below    i    an issuer other than a business combination related shell company as defined in § or an assetbacked issuer as defined in item b of regulation ab §b of this chapter that has   a           no or nominal operations and              b           either        no or nominal assets     assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents or     assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets or   ii           an issuer that has been at any time previously an issuer described in paragraph ii              notwithstanding paragraph i if the issuer of the securities previously had been an issuer described in paragraph ii but has ceased to be an issuer described in paragraph ii is subject to the reporting requirements of section  or d of the exchange act has filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by section  or d of the exchange act as applicable during the preceding  months or for such shorter period that the issue was required to file such reports and materials other than form k reports § of this chapter and has filed current “form  information” with the sec reflecting its status as an entity that is no longer an issuer described in paragraph ii then those securities may be sold subject to the requirements of this section after one year has elapsed from the date that the issuer filed “form  information” with the sec              the term “form  information” means the information that is required by form  or form f §f of this chapter as applicable to the issuer of the securities to register under the exchange act each class of securities being sold under this rule  the issuer may provide the form  information in any filing of the issuer with the commission  the form  information is deemed filed when the initial filing is made with the commission”   securities of a shell company cannot be publicly sold under rule  in the absence of compliance with this subparagraph though the sec has implied that these restrictions would not be enforced respecting securities issued by a shell company while it was not determined to be a shell company    section  of the securities act   since we are a “shell company” as defined in subparagraph i of rule  our shares of common stock cannot be publicly resold under rule  until we comply with the requirements outlined above under the heading “shell companies”  until those requirements have been satisfied any resales of our shares of common stock must be made in compliance with the provisions of the exemption from registration under the securities act provided in section  thereof applicable to persons other than “an issuer underwriter or a dealer”  that will require that such shares of
