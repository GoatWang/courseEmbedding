support for advanced power management required in many of today’s electronic products from mobile device to servers and networking advanced low power techniques such as power gating retention lowvdd standby and dynamic voltage scaling dvs employ voltage control to enable finegrained power management and are seeing increasingly prevalent adoption due to the nature of low power design architectures and behavior low power verification complexity is exponentially more challenging than for alwayson verification native low power simulation and advanced low power static verification and signoff must manage this increased complexity and still attain all verification objectives download datasheet static checking challenges for low power designs advanced intentdriven low power design flows requires complete and rapid checking of low power implementation and behavior validity at every stage in the flow in addition analyzing debugging and fixing violations must be easy and efficient in order to effectively enable designers to eliminate possibly designkilling low power bugs early in the design flow   low power soc designs are partitioned into power domains that can be separately controlled by one or more low power design techniques and verification complexity increases exponentially with the number of power domains also increasingly stringent power requirements have necessitated the use of multiple supply voltages adding another dimension to verification complexity finally low power designs typically operate in multiple modes with each mode corresponding to one or more power states—yet a third dimension of additional complexity comprehensive verification of low power designs requires verification not just in all the power domains all combinations of supply voltages and all power states and modes but also of the specified transitions and transition order within these power states as the design moves from one operating mode to another a single bug in any of these incredibly complex scenarios may cause functional failures in silicon   low power design techniques add new design elements at different stages of the design flow architectural design bugs that violate the principles of low power design may exist even at rtl isolation cells are typically synthesized automatically retention register connections need to be validated after synthesis and again after place and route multivoltage designs require the appropriate power and ground pins to be connected to the specified supply rails low power static checking must operate comprehensively in all stages of the design flow in order to accurately verify correct implementation and behavior in all of these cases  features and benefits power intent consistency checks syntax and semantic checks on upf that help validate the consistency of upf prior to implementation incorrect power intent will result in incorrect low power design implementation the upf consistency checks ensure that the power intent specification driving low power implementation is syntactically and semantically correct architectural checks global checks at rtl for signals violating power architecture rules vc lp validates the design in its entirety and checks the critical signal networks in the design for the various power modes these checks help find connectivity related bugs which would cause functional issues very early in the design cycle structural and power and ground pg checks validation of insertion and connection of isolation cells power switches level shifters retention registers and alwayson cells

derivation of a hierarchical power state table vc lp understands the power intent and is able to prune a large number of power states to a few distinct ones thus reducing the effort involved to

to cortical and subcortical structures previous studies demonstrate two l pyramid types corticocortical cc and corticosubcortical cs we characterize connectivity and function of these cell types in mouse primary visual cortex and reveal a new subtype unlike previously described l cc and cs neurons this new subtype does not project to striatum corticocortical nonstriatal ccns and has distinct morphology physiology and visual responses monosynaptic rabies tracing reveals that cc neurons preferentially receive input from higher visual areas while cs neurons receive more input from structures implicated in topdown modulation of brain states cs neurons are also more directionselective and prefer faster stimuli than cc neurons these differences suggest distinct roles as specialized output

investor login secondary investments partnership holdings ← back limited partner secondaries and signals of defaults february   as featured in secondaries investor subscription on    the recent stock market correction and ongoing volatility signal that another cycle of increased secondary volume driven by limited partner “lp” sales may be imminent  it has been over seven years since the industry has experienced defaults in any meaningful volume and we are now starting to see an increase in this activity  this primer identifies the market dynamics that lead to lp defaults and the criteria that gps employ to fill in the gaps with appropriate valuable investors how the lp secondary market works transactions in the secondary market for company shares and limited partnership interests are much less public than in the primary venture market  when a vc invests in a company both the company and the venture fund typically promote the investment via social media and a press release  secondary transactions seldom get announced and oneoff lp interest transfers are never publicized by venture capital funds  it’s not surprising that general partners and their respective limited partners want to keep this activity quiet  an lp interest transfer resulting from a very practical reason could unnecessarily be misconstrued as a vote of no confidence by the lp or a signal of an lp’s poor financial health contrary to popular belief almost every venture capital fund experiences lp transfers lp defaults on the rise and transfers like a vcbacked company has investors a venture fund has investors ie the limited partners or “lps” who sign limited partnership agreements “lpas” that legally bind them to fund a certain amount of money ie commitment amount  unlike vcbacked companies limited partners do not fund the entire commitment amount on day one   typically the general partner of a venture fund draws down capital over a three to seven year period on an asneeded basis  lpas usually state that if a limited partner does not fund a capital call ie a request for part of the commitment amount as part of an investment in the portfolio then the limited partner may be placed in default  when an lp default occurs the general partner will seek to find a new limited partner to buy out the defaulting lp and take over the unfunded liabilities the secondary market typically experiences increased selling and transfer activity in venture funds after a public market correction or a liquidity crunch ie the current energy market crisis  when investors lose large amounts of capital in the public market eg more than a  to  correction in the nasdaq individual and nontraditional limited partners in venture funds traditionally start to sell or reduce their stakes to reduce or eliminate their unfunded liabilities ie future capital calls  suitable secondary lps what type of new limited partner does a venture fund want assessing over  venture capital fund secondary transfers where our firm acquired interests we identified several criteria that venture capital managers use to find a new limited partner  a stable balance sheet and understanding of the asset class and company risk levels  a  longterm capital source with prior experience in the asset class  an existing limited partner relationship with the desire to increase fund ownership  ability and predisposition to invest into new partnerships in the future  ability to help portfolio companies with valueadded introductions strategic advice and direct coinvestment dollars  straightforward internal processes  a proven commitment to the asset class through both up and downcycles  diversified capital sources ie not only invested in one area  prior experience with secondary transactions  quickly identifying appropriate lps can help minimize the inevitable negative impact of defaults on venture capital funds and portfolio company management teams  working with an experienced and trusted partner solves this problem and allows the industry to function in a healthy way regardless of fluctuating market cycles hans swildens and amir malayery industry ventures share industry ventures was formed in  by hans swildens to make seed stage investments in startup technology companies shortly after making our first investments the nasdaq collapsed and the venture business entered a very difficult liquidity period in  we pivoted the investment focus to purchase shares in venture backed companies in secondary transactions our first secondary investment was the purchase of shares in speedera networks from a publicly traded corporation hans helped his brother eric start speedera networks with rich day and ajit gupta together the era speedera networks was acquired by akamai in  prior to speedera eric and hans founded microline software after eric wrote various user interface components of netscape navigator  in  microline was acquired in  by neuron data and the combined company rebranded blaze software blaze went public in  and was subsequently acquired by fair isaac a few months after buying part of speedera the firm acquired the venture capital division of electronic data systems eds during the period of  the firm acquired over  million of invested capital from various sellers of venture capital portfolios including bowman capital enron broadband ventures and infospace this investment activity was instrumental in the early formation of the secondary market for venture capital investments in  we launched our fund of funds effort with the acquisition of little hawk capital management we saw inefficiencies and investment outperformance in small venture capital funds we have subsequently built a portfolio of over twenty small venture capital funds with leading early stage investors today we coinvest alongside these funds in their highgrowth businesses over the last decade the firm evolved from being a pioneer of secondary investments into the leading provider of liquidity for the venture capital market we manage over  billion from institutional investors and operate with one of the largest investment teams in the
