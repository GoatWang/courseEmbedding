startupthe bizfilings blog covering business tips and trends corporation or llc published on apr   summary read corporation or llc at time to start up the small business blog by bizfilings perhaps the most common advice a new small business owner hears is to incorporate there are advantages as well as complications but even if you decide to go ahead with incorporation thats only the first of many choices youll need to make the next step is deciding whether to form a corporation or llc the two are similar in many ways both are legally a bit like individuals its as if youve given birth – suddenly theres this new entity with rights of its own like that new baby the new entity is not equivalent to you and youll get yourself in hot water if you pretend otherwise even if you are the only employee writing a check for billys braces out of the company account is just like writing it out of your next door neighbors checkbook so long as you are in compliance with state law both types offer full limited liability to all of the owners of the business in every state but neither a corporation nor an llc will protect you in the event of your own malpractice or malfeasance in both cases youll want business insurance to protect yourself neither will take on your own personal debts—nice try—but in most states and industries both will protect your personal assets in cases such as legal malfeasance by an employee so if theyre similar in all those ways how are they different most of it comes down to the way theyre treated at tax time an llc is a passthrough type of business profits and losses of the organization go straight through to the owners business income equals personal income so the owner pays the tax on his or her personal return and its taxed at the individual rate corporations are separate businesses entities with profits and losses taxable to themselves not to the owners as a result corporations are taxed at the corporate rate llcs are generally simpler in structure and in reporting requirements but in some circumstances proprietors can earn a substantially increased tax bill through the addition of the selfemployment tax currently at a painful  percent in some situations corporations can bring their own tax headaches as mentioned above the corporation is taxed on its profits but the owner is also taxed on any dividends and salary from the company its a double tax and it can seriously cut into the real dollars earned in the end this is the beginning not the end of a branching tree of decisions your attorney or tax accountant can help you find the right path to making your entrepreneurial dream a reality see additonal info in our learning center on both starting an llc starting a corporation tags business incorporation corporation form a

startupthe bizfilings blog covering business tips and trends corporation or llc published on apr   summary read corporation or llc at time to start up the small business blog by bizfilings perhaps the most common advice a new small business owner hears is to incorporate there are advantages as well as complications but even if you decide to go ahead with incorporation thats only the first of many choices youll need to make the next step is deciding whether to form a corporation or llc the two are similar in many ways both are legally a bit like individuals its as if youve given birth – suddenly theres this new entity with rights of its own like that new baby the new entity is not equivalent to you and youll get yourself in hot water if you pretend otherwise even if you are the only employee writing a check for billys braces out of the company account is just like writing it out of your next door neighbors checkbook so long as you are in compliance with state law both types offer full limited liability to all of the owners of the business in every state but neither a corporation nor an llc will protect you in the event of your own malpractice or malfeasance in both cases youll want business insurance to protect yourself neither will take on your own personal debts—nice try—but in most states and industries both will protect your personal assets in cases such as legal malfeasance by an employee so if theyre similar in all those ways how are they different most of it comes down to the way theyre treated at tax time an llc is a passthrough type of business profits and losses of the organization go straight through to the owners business income equals personal income so the owner pays the tax on his or her personal return and its taxed at the individual rate corporations are separate businesses entities with profits and losses taxable to themselves not to the owners as a result corporations are taxed at the corporate rate llcs are generally simpler in structure and in reporting requirements but in some circumstances proprietors can earn a substantially increased tax bill through the addition of the selfemployment tax currently at a painful  percent in some situations corporations can bring their own tax headaches as mentioned above the corporation is taxed on its profits but the owner is also taxed on any dividends and salary from the company its a double tax and it can seriously cut into the real dollars earned in the end this is the beginning not the end of a branching tree of decisions your attorney or tax accountant can help you find the right path to making your entrepreneurial dream a reality see additonal info in our learning center on both starting an llc starting a corporation tags business incorporation corporation form a
