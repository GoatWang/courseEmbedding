and wide selection of product and its highend positioning drove growth at the dixie group tdg for the last decade allowing it to recover and thrive sooner than perhaps other carpet firms “we recovered more quickly because we were positioned at the higher end and even during the worst of the downturn we were investing in new products” daniel k frierson chairman and ceo told fcw “retailers want more choices and we do a good job of offering retailers more on the commercial side we also offer more options to specifiers” dixie also maintains significant inventory so that it can deliver what its dealers need quickly with a history that began in  tdg continues to grow and thrive through its ability to evolve to suit changes in environment made up of dixie home masland residential fabrica and masland contract increased tdg’s carpet sales grew  percent from  through  as reported in last year’s annual report residential carpet sales were up  percent while commercial sales grew  percent the growth was driven by extensive investment in “product processes and people” said daniel frierson once the recovery started dixie began to look for acquisition opportunities and has made key additions every year since  “there were no prospects from  until ” noted kennedy frierson vice president and coo “but in the last two and half years opportunities have come and we have taken advantage of them we wanted to be differentiated across the commercial and residential markets in late  we purchased colormaster a continuous dye operation and crown rugs we moved the crown rugs business to california and merged it into masland residential” in  dixie purchased robertex a manufacturer of tufted wool carpets with skein dyeing facilities the acquisition included carousel carpet which had been acquired by robertex in  “robertex was a good fit with dixie’s complimentary strengths because we have the marketing and sales network” kennedy frierson explained “robertex is sold through masland and within the next  to  months the robertex brand will transition to masland” he added also in  dixie entered agreements with desso a major european manufacturer of broadloom and modular carpet based in the netherlands “the two companies which have complementary strengths began working together in october ” said kennedy frierson “we have a hospitality joint venture that combines desso’s woven axminster products with tufted products from masland hospitality that also includes some printed broadloom lines dixie and desso sales teams are selling the products together for a complete package” he said desso a leading modular tile supplier in europe did not have distribution in the us its second agreement with dixie has the masland contract sales force selling a selection of desso modular tile products “some of the products are very ‘green’” kennedy frierson said “masland is about design excellence while desso has technical expertise” kennedy frierson stated looking for a way to grow its commercial business internally dixie launched avant carpet a new brand in  looking to fill a need for a more fashion brand some avant products launched in  but more are being introduced this year kennedy frierson said “we have built a sales force from agents already in the marketplace to cover the us and canada” in march of this year dixie acquired atlas carpets “it fits the dixie culture and position in the commercial market” said kennedy frierson both companies are style driven for the most part atlas continues to operate as it did before the acquisition but its dyeing operations have been consolidated into dixie’s susan street fabrica facility located in santa ana calif “our plan is to leverage atlas design strengths with dixie’s manufacturing capabilities to be able to bring its highfashion products to market with better price points” said kennedy frierson “atlas has a very strong sales force and excellent brand equity in the market place which should maximize our opportunities for growth investments in equipment and services are also ongoing “we have increased yarn production by  percent” kennedy frierson said adding “we reopened tufting in eton ga in  we ran out of capacity at colormaster so we are also continuing to invest in dyeing capacity we also ran out of space for distribution so are leasing space in adairsville ga and are moving the residential products to that facility” an essential part of dixie’s position in residential carpet is its continuing partnership with stainmaster daniel frierson explained that dixie had been a manufacturer partner with dupont during its textile days and is now committed to invista for branded nylon  — stainmaster for residential and antron for commercial “invista has the most stylish yarns for differentiated beautiful carpet” stressed daniel frierson going forward dixie will continue to be open to opportunities but is not planning any new acquisitions soon “right now we need to absorb and stream line all operations to take top line growth to the bottom line” said kennedy frierson the frierson tenure at dixie while the frierson family has never been sole owner of dixie the two names have a long history j burton frierson daniel frierson’s father joined the original dixie in  and in  he became a coowner of the business j burton frierson was active in the business until he retired in the s daniel frierson joined dixie in  after graduating from the university of virginia “i worked every job in the plant and operations at first” he recalled “i started working in dalton in the candlewick carpet yarn business in the 7s and then became ceo of dixie in  and chairman in ” dixie held its first public trade offering in the mids daniel frierson explained that today the frierson family has significant investments in dixie and voting control over the management of the company kennedy frierson the third generation spent some time in chicago after graduating from princeton in  where he earned a master’s degree and cpa from depaul university “in  he came to work in dixie’s textile business but when we sold that in the  he went back to school for a graduate degree in business and rejoined the company in  since then kennedy frierson has served as president of masland residential general manager of dixie home president of bretlin as well as other positions in operations
