had a leasehold on davidsimoncom for years now  people smarter than i am told me that even if i had no sense of its use at present i should throw a few shekels down in case  but until recently i saw no reason to do much of anything with the site my ambivalence rests on a couple basic ideas   i’m a writer and while i’m overpaid to write television at present the truth is that the prose world from which i crawled — newsprint and books — is beset by a new economic model in which the value of content is being reduced in direct proportion to the availability of free stuff on the web in short for newspapers and book publishers it has lately been an erace to the bottom and i have no desire to contribute to that new economy by writing for free in any format  not that what is posted here has much prolonged value — or in the case of previously published prose hasn’t soured some beyond its expiration — but the principle in which i genuinely believe holds  writers everywhere do this to make a living and some are doing fine work and barely getting by for their labor  anything that says content should be free makes it hard for all writers everywhere   if at any point in the future this site offers more than a compendium of old prose work and the odd comment or two on recent events — if it grows in purpose or improves in execution — i might try to toss up a small monthly charge in support of one of the c charities listed in the worthy causes section  and yes i know that doing so will lose a good many readers but to me anyway the principle matters   a free internet is wonderful for democratized unresearched commentary and it works well as a library of sorts for content that no longer requires a defense of its copyright  but journalism literature film music —  these endeavors need people operating at the highest professional level and they need to make a living wage  copyright matters  content costs this stuff takes time  and those who know me understand that while it is refreshing to meet people with no opinions i am not that fellow i like to argue  i don’t take the argument itself personally — and i am often amazed at so much outsized commentary that assumes otherwise — but rather i delight in pursuing a good ranging argument  it’s why i value a writer’s room so much  it’s why i used to love a healthy newsroom which i have described as a magical place where everyone disagrees with everything all of the time  arguments make the work better when people stop arguing or at least arguing intelligently absent the usual halfassed rhetorical cheating the work invariably suffers  so for me any dialectic is a temptation  and i may find that given so much work i owe already even a brief sortie into an issue or two or a stray comment on current events will sound as a siren song  i may want to shut this venue down three weeks after anyone finds it if they do  i may forgive me find that i need to disable the comments and simply use the blog to highlight stuff and then run like hell  apologies in advance if it comes to that on the positive side of the ledger every now and then over breakfast or in the office or late at night i read something or hear something that impresses or infuriates or amuses or that provokes an interesting backandforth between family members or colleagues  an argument or discussion gets good a joke ripens nicely  it’s stuff that isn’t going into a script or into any shard of published prose and its shelflife is often short  maybe that’s what a blog is for it’s nice to have a small billboard with which one can highlight and link to the work of others we admire to simply recommend the good stuff and similarly it helps to highlight the nonprofit affiliations supported by the projects that we’re working on in baltimore and new orleans  maybe a bit more good comes from such in these later years i’ve come to discover that from time to time media folk call me to ask a question or two  being exactly who the hell i am i actually haven’t done much until now to filter my answers  i speak bluntly but speaking alas isn’t writing and very recently i had to waste half a weekend swimming through some foment of my own creation  for lack of clarity i managed to say something that i not only don’t believe but that is contradicted by every other interview that precedes it  the fault was largely my own but a remedy i realized was problematic calling back the reporter who had used what i thought was a specific critique in the most general and absurd way i found that i was either obliged to continue working through him to correct the record — and trusting in a dynamic that had failed already or alternatively i had to offer myself up in another interview to a reporter who i knew for certain would endeavor to deliver my answers in context but who was more interested in other topics than the one which concerned me and in the middle of this my wife — who uses both words and the internet better than i do — reminded me of the long fallow field of  davidsimoncom if that thing was up and running she pointed out you could simply say in your own words precisely and carefully what you intended to say in the first place without having to rely on a filter  this is the grand triumph of the internet after all there’s no arguing with the democratization inherent  you could she told me simply say what you meant and have that on the record  the simplicity of this had considerable appeal so here goes don’t send screenplays or manuscripts for quotes or actor glossies  please  there are professional venues for such and if stuff comes to me correct i do the best i can  promise  if it comes at me through this venue i won’t — can’t — respond  counterarguments and counterprovocations on any given issue — let’s say that again issue — are entirely welcome whether i have time to respond or not ad hominem rage flattery and posted links for cheap timeshares naked photographs of your exgirlfriend at a small monthly fee and invitations to a larger penis in just weeks are politely discouraged unless your exgirlfriend is notably hot of course best david simon    commentsposted in blog by david simon ← oh

minor drug offenses i thought of your documentary “the house i live in” and how much your research and voice are necessary especially now i was hoping to read your insight on the state of our democracy here that is worth your time and trouble and frankly necessary when chaos and ineptitude is on the rise reply lee carney says november   at  pm i am sure you will disagree with me on this mr simon and i am probably wrong just writing out of spite and anger but this is how i feel today and i am an australian living in sydney none of the ryan budget ultra nasties will even direct impact me anyway as of this moment i genuinely wish everyone on the left would follow my advice below when the inevitable economic meltdown of the trump presidency and ryan budget arrives it is going to cause pain for huge numbers of ppl being decent ppl who care deeply for their fellow humans and social justice ppl on the left will feel compelled to give to charities and support laws and causes that help the less fortunate however when that time comes there will be many ppl and groups in need so with limited resources to give never forget who caused this catastrophe the white male so give to planned parenthood give to the naacp fight to ensure continued funding for minority outreach programs refugees and the southern poverty law centre what you don’t do is support any group or charity who have as their beneficiaries white working class men they sowed the wind let them reap the whirlwind they voted against an increase in the minimum wage they voted against universal prek they voted against free college tuition they voted for sweeping deregulation of wall st do not give your support to farming communities who voted for climate change denial and more droughts who voted for oil pipelines through arable land the white male voted for catastrophic policies so let them bear the brunt use your resources to help the ppl who did not ask for this reply lawrence grandpre says july   at  pm …i understand why this narrative would make sense to david simon disaffected youth finds solace in a community where he literally “finds” his voice and can engage in the sort of dialogue and mutual sharing of ideas so often missing on “the corner” the complex and nuanced reality of black life in baltimore is omitted in the bleak european tragedy narrative “the wire” is locked into and with so many people theorizing about how to “save” baltimore now it seems important for there to be a deconstruction of “the wire’s” problematic tacit political assumptions on race “the wire” is a fine piece of art—it truly stands alone in american television—but as a political text it reflects the problems in much of leftist american political discourse with oldhat union politics and white liberalism being the only life rafts thrown to the audience in a sea of pessimism the disjunction between the portrayal of namond being saved by debate and an analysis of how debate actually works in baltimore is just the clearest example of the problem with this debate does save lives in baltimore but not the style of debate simon portrays on “the wire” namond reads a prepared speech about the ravages of aids in africa calling for africans to be saved by foreign aid the way he in theory has been saved by this nonprofit organization in his style and content whiteness and respectability are grafted onto his black body and in this context his moment of being “saved” takes on a much more nefarious quality in reality dressing in suits and talking about foreign policy have not appealed to youth on the corner at least not until rogue bands of black debaters began bucking debatecommunity convention and explicitly focusing on racismwhite supremacy using abrasive confrontational hiphop styles the rogue debaters have ruffled the feathers of the liberal “nonprofit professionals” who control urban debate leagues around the country but have helped produce a decade of black policy debate champions with the agency and training to take on the unique challenges of being black in america this includes the current and former debaters who helped to lead a key protest in baltimore in the aftermath of monday april ’s violence the people who advised simon on his debate scenes represent the standardbearers in the traditional world of debate if they had their way namond would have been “saved” in the traditional sense of getting access to vestiges of institutional privilege but would never have gotten the training he needed to help play his role in “saving” this city in the midst of turmoil and uncertainty to simon the namonds of the world may be skilled in holding another banal public forum but they lack the connection to grassroots activism and the historical context to choose to take to the streets and take their place as leaders of a growing social movement this is not to accuse simon of anything nefarious but he was shooting a show in the middle of the debate community’s civil war and he chose the wrong side of it which can be chalked up to the unknown unknowns inherent in white liberal attempts to engage black suffering which is an inherent problem “the wire” “the wire” packages black suffering so that it is digestible to a white public a  course on urban decay but the ground it makes up in appealing to hbo’s white professional demographic it loses in its inability to focus on everyday black people surviving and thriving in the face of the “tragic” conditions simon and company thrust upon them the closest the show gets to presenting an autonomous black solution to black problems is cutty’s boxing gym and the fate of the young people who cycle through there frame the effort largely as a failure this is in stark comparison to the portrayals of the illfated efforts of frank sobotka who despite engaging in criminal activity is seen as the fulcrum in interracial solidarity and is selfsacrificing for allocating smuggling money to a political campaign to increase jobs at the port the limitations of this labor activism is framed by the most problematic bit of language in the show’s five seasons which is not anything bird says to kima in an interrogation chamber but when sobotka in effect says to nat a black colleague that without the extra jobs dredging would bring “we’re all niggers” in a country that simply refuses to grapple with the reality of its legacy of slavery the show fails to mention slavery in any serious way in five seasons or the distinction between white poverty and black poverty to uncritically collapse the centuries of black suffering in baltimore to essentially the same as that of an unemployed white person shows the fundamental inability to grasp the reality of antiblack racism in baltimore in fact whether it be the tacit framing of black union folks as “irrational” in wanting to have black leadership of the union or portraying the citizens of baltimore falling for mayor royce’s transparent racebaiting tactics including dressing in kente cloth to make himself appear more authentically black the show most vaunted by the white liberal academy for its engagement with race seems to believe there is no legitimate way in which racism can be presented in political contexts unless you’re a welldressed former corner boy at a debate tournament calling for more white saviors to be sent to africa maybe this is why over its five seasons there is hardly a whiff of a “black lives matter”type movement in response to conditions in baltimore for that would require a a realistic portrayal of police brutality which the show largely avoids in deference to its “good polease” mythology and b a show runner that would embrace the belief—which their vestigial marxism and white liberalism both stand in contrast to—that black people have the power to come up with their own solutions and ultimately save themselves filling those requirements however would lack the satisfying catharsis of seeing namond in his suit giving a speech perhaps it’s time for our vision of race to reach beyond relatively antiseptic and twitterfriendly popculture analysis and actually get to the depth of issues around race in america for despite how challenging this is after the credits roll we’re all brought back to the real baltimore the insight we find when we consider real baltimore will actually determine whether our future is a rerun of the same false promises and neoliberal decay of the past  years or if through investing in grassroots indigenous institutions baltimore has even the slightest chance at the happy ending “the wire” consistently denies us reply happy walters says august   at  pm think more hemingway less faulkner reply lawrence grandpre says july   at  pm the wire very intentionally attempts to position itself outside of the american tradition of police dramas employing hbo’s free subscriberbased model and the subsequent freedom from corporate sponsors the wire attempts to complicate if not eschew the notion of police as the unambiguous “good guys” taking down the forces of evil that continues to dominate network tv cop dramas as such the show attempts to mirror the real life multiplicity of cops fictional depictions of police violence go beyond what viewers typically see on screen while the show’s depictions of police violence are advanced the liberal and marxist foundations of the wire too often prevent the racialized reality of police violence from becoming evident the show seeks intellectual resolution for its educated white audience over integrating power relations that locate the police force as an institution— good intentions of individual police aside— as a critical force for perpetuating structural racism and white supremacy in the baltimore of the wire police bias is an aberration an individualized moment where cops can fall from grace and fail to attain the vaunted label of “good polease” by succumbing to their own egos the pressures of a system driven by statistics and political posturing or at times their own personal biases the show’s two most prominent instances of police violence fit into this template when police detectives “hurc” prezboluski and carver drink to do “field interviews” in season  they are framed as victims of institutional obsession with statistics they are trained to “take bodies” in order to up arrest rates and thus develop into the soldiers of a failed drug war the subsequent assault of a young black youth by the white officer prezboluski which cost the youth his eye is portrayed as a moment of drunken bravado the incident precipitates angry responses from the residents of the baltimore apartment complex throwing bottles and even a television at the cop below which incites gunfire from the fearful inebriated police officers from the perspective on an academic many interesting things are being portrayed here the subtle sense of white privilege prezboluski and herc show how carver reluctantly acquiesces to their calls to go into the black baltimore and “let them know we’re here” the dynamic of power and resistance between the cops and the citizens and the nature of institutional accountability after their supervisor the black police lieutenant daniels instructs his officers on the usage of technical language to avoid consequences for their actions but as a citizen of baltimore i am overwhelmed by the sense of complete inadequacy there is the portrayal of wanted drunken antiblack police violence the inability to discuss the disproportionate police force used by the cops and the bulleted response to beer bottles after violently instigating a conflict with innocent citizens one of whom is made to remove his pants during a search furthermore the ridiculousness of the dramatized moment where the people in the apartment return fire at the police is so unlikely as to be inconceivable given the widespread understanding of the consequences of even touching an officer yet alone shooting at one the complete lack of accountability allows a white officer who commits a violent act on a black youth to be unpunished yet the show has no time to flesh out any of these dynamics despite its vaunted “slow meandering” style as the plight of black “civilians” black baltimore’s not in the drug trade or part of the police force is sublimated in the name of advancing the narrative battle between the cops and the dealers the show’s socalled intellectual complexity and boasted moral ambiguity fail to provide a space for a stance against systematic police violence that would be necessary for the show to actually meet some of the social justice goals that the creators david simon and ed burns set out to meet the show limits its notions of justice to macrolevel marxistinspired intuitional analysis and liberal individualism the individuals in this instance are essentially “vindicated” throughout the next  seasons hurc eventually becomes a successful private investigator who eventually helps the police crack a big case prez becomes a loving and compassionate teacher and carver evolves into an effective investigator who exemplifies “good polease” by learning about the personal lives of the “hopers” in his district as well as caring for randy a youth targeted after being labeled a “snitch” for talking to the police nowhere is the societal pressure behind the obsession with crime statistics interrogated nor the reality of the racialization of the war on drugs assessed and neither still the deep american desire to see law enforcement as statesanctioned control of the black body interrogated this would violate the deeply rooted white liberalism and marxist tendencies which demand a colorblind classcentered analysis of the problem indeed the reality of baltimore policing shows the ubiquity of racial bias in the shooting of unarmed black men by local cops which despite the show’s claims of “gritty” realism never appear once in the  seasons of the wire the questions of subconscious bias are subsumed by the shows liberal individualism in ways that make the show palatable to a largely white liberal audience but ultimately obscure the racialized reality of policing prez’s shooting of a black cop is the closest the show comes to broaching the subject of subconscious bias but prez’s subsequent relationship with black students as well as his narrative portrayal as a “goof” absolve him from a substantial amount of assumed bias moreover his recognition of the possibility of racial bias fits within the show’s white liberal narrative to simply see a character acknowledge that they could have subconscious racial bias is counted as a win within the liberal sensibilities of the audience forestalling any substantive social justice question about the larger system of police tactics in this individualized moment similarly the season  portrayal of the white cop colicciho dragging a black teacher out of his car is portrayed as a rogue police officer the audience is instructed to praise the courage of carver for being willing to report him and not follow standard operating procedure of instructing his subordinate how to “write” the incident using technical language and favorable narration of the facts help to absolve the officer of institutional or legal reprisal as daniels does in season  with his officers again police violence is shown as a personal failing the solution to which is not to question the nature of hyperpolicing the lack of community control and the cultural relationship of white cops in a predominantly black city but more “good polease” with the strength and fortitude to stand up to the pressures within a corrupt system in the name of truth and justice there is a consistent theme with the wire the show’s socalled realism really stems from it producing a vision of baltimore that represents what the audience thinks baltimore is like not what it is actually like the reality is in a city like baltimore whose political dynamics demand performances of control over black bodies to assuage the deep seated racial fears of a white electorate too often “crack heads taken bodies” is not an aberration the personal failing and affront to the notion of “good polease” is its very definition the show attempts to portray a heroic deputy commissioner daniels refusing political pressure from the white mayor tommy carcetti to “juke the stats” or fudge numbers as to falsely improve crime statistics in reality the political moment of the wire’s last season coincided with martin o’malley the baltimore mayor then maryland governor on whom carcetti is loosely based on precipitating a rash of mass arrests of predominantly black men in baltimore in order to “juke the stats” and help him in his eventually successful gubernatorial run that the wire fails to present this reality is an affront to its so called “realism” and furthers the notions that “civilians” don’t matter in the representational world of the wire too often those who are “jacked up” by police are portrayed as guilty even as the wire has mixed messages about drug prohibition and tries to humanize the baltimore’s drug users the reality of the utter capricious nature of police harassment is obscured behind the wire’s inability despite its desire to shake the legacy of the traditional cop drama of its “good polease” mythology in reality the mass arrests of  lead to untold numbers of innocent men receiving violent contact with the police the trauma of which the wire simply refuses to acknowledge to inhabit a body perpetually open to police search to be violated by those given state authority to deem you as a threat to be physically molested with searches and to even be killed with essential impunity the show’s own logical reveals how easy it is for cops to get away with violence produces a relationship to the world that the show with its white liberalism and marxism simply cannot accommodate or represent perhaps this is why nowhere in the show does public resistance to policing even become part of the plot like a good marxist simon views the “citizens” of baltimore as simply cogs in the machine of capital not autonomous cultural grounded subjects with the ability to theorize outside of the intuitions the school the union the police which for simon essential brings black folk worth representing it is no surprise thus that nothing akin to the blacklivesmatter movement is seen in the wire it operates outside the ideological framework of the show’s framing vibrating “on the lower frequencies” of black social institutions that operate outside the show’s conceptions of resistance regards lawrence grandpre reply bob condon says july   at  am the genius of audacity i was looking for something to lift up this evening and treme is it it captured the feel of the city even though i didn’t know it at the time all i heard at first was the music which brought south me like a siren song then i got the feel in the air that i never got anywhere else in this world i was more than just a little overcome kermit’s birthday in the treme a band on the street in the marigny i’ve tasted langiappe and i owe you we should all be so lucky reply donell doyce says may   at  am mr simon are there any books on port unions and the decline of their influence over the years that you would consider recommended reading admittedly i was influenced in my question by the second season of “the wire” reply larry johnson says march   at  am mr simon this thread is more current than the one i just posted at regarding the wire i just wanted to thank you again for the series i just watched the entire run on dvd over the last five weeks or so never having had cable tv it was all remarkable and fulfilling on a few occasions i watched five or six episodes through the night though it was way past bedtime but i kept hitting the play button until the sun came up it’s one of the best things ever on television and it was like discovering a new author and having to read everything they ever wrote i’m looking forward to going through the whole thing again someday just the way i reread my favorite books reply ben merliss says december   at  pm rest in peace melvin williams  an utterly fascinating human being who gave an unforgettable performance on “the wire” reply lee carney says november   at  pm hey david do u remember writing this  years ago and this may be the last election in which anyone but a fool tries to play — on a national level at least — the cards of racial exclusion of immigrant fear of the patronization of women and hegemony over their bodies of selfrighteous discrimination against homosexuals now i admit they are fools so u could still argue you were right i guess but the gop are determined to prove you wrong it seems 🙂 reply david simon says november   at  am they are indeed fools we’re not manufacturing white men at a sufficient rate that they can run a national candidate without beginning at an extreme disadvantage and the things said to secure the gop nomination will have to be discarded and renounced after the primaries or defeat reply goat says august   at  am do you also recall writing that if you were in the shoes of a black person in this country you would resort to violence congratulations mr simon – many are heeding your advice reply david simon says august   at  am is this a matter of reading comprehension or just basic dishonesty i know exactly what i wrote is meaning has either eluded you or you enjoy dissembling reply malik siraj akbar says september   at  pm dear david the national low income housing coalition in washington dc which annually publishes the unique housing affordability and minimum wage report “out of reach” wishes to invite you to speak at our annual housing conference in dc in april  what is the best way to send you an invitation my email is email protected and twitter is maliksirajakbar thank you in advance and congratulations over “show me a hero” i look forward to seeing you at the talk in dc with hud secretary castro reply bekah says september   at  pm david fine piece of work with show me a hero hope things are coming along on potential taylor branchmlk project now that i really want to see in your able hands reply lakshman says august   at  am high praise from a respected in my opinion anyways for show me a hero i especially like this line “directors such as elia kazan sidney lumet and spike lee dealt with serious moral questions and made urban realism riveting messrs simon and zorzi are their successors but their work is richer more sophisticated—and better” httpwwweconomistcomnewsbooksandartsnewseriescreatorwiredownanddirtycityhall reply lakshman says august   at  am mr simon congratulations on show me a hero i haven’t watched it yet but the critics’ reviews are glowing and not that i would expect any less thank you lakshman reply kevin stewart says august   at  pm hello david i have been gathering research for four days now i blog on movie pilot and when i learned of the upcoming miniseries show me a hero i came here as part of that research first off i did and do not watch much television i tend to be a rolling stone i found the wire during its first season just walking past someones tv set who had a subscription to hbo it was refreshing to have a show arrest my interest not having a television set i think i orchestrated a relationship with a woman who had one and who also subscribed to hbo just so i could cuddle and catch each episode years later and season later i would find family members who came to love the show thus i kept up with it sporadically now that i find myself trying to write about you i allowed my mind to go back and see what images come to mind about new york and the ’s i saw archie bunker i later clicked another writer producer named norman lear i will not belabor you with his contributions as i am sure you know more about him than i do in  words or less can you share with me the differences or similarities if any to your and his approaches i know he worked with networks and you abhor the limitations they offer your kind of storytelling but toss me a bone would you reply eric the mike of kocherton says july   at  am dear david ” beloved by all as the bible dictates… ” i have been captured again but us forces part of a program that is more magical than real i was hoping you would join this “free” internet writing thingy your boy obama got going on more people read this shit than you think for fuck sakes i had all the queens men arrive at my door minutes after trying to digitaly kiss ole barry using choose words and hashtag’esk mockery that ‘type’ that just wouldn’t translate in todays court of law backstopped by a jury of monkeys … ya i get it things got weird but lol wtf can a nigga do i mean lions are dying all over the place cecil forget about the drone strikes those people don’t have names its all about how you name it keep your head up there is a war going on  your good friend eric ps keep the god damn comments open reply roy boythorn says july   at  pm the “goddamn comments” look about as open as they could be reply ben merliss says july   at  pm so you’ve finally joined twitter eh well all i will say is this… beware the haters and the trolls not that you don’t already know that but i just thought i’d put it out since they have a far more easier time of it there than they do here reply david simon says july   at  am the twitter account is for posting links and announcing stuff only unmonitored by me and no replies to argument or rhetoric posted there will be forthcoming at  characters it is a disengaged bulletin board reply lakshman says july   at  am not that you asked or need advice but it does carry your name but doesn’t have the verified tick mark so a little attention to what gets posted under your name would be prudent i think in any case i am following you and so are  plus other people welcome to twitter reply david simon says july   at  am tick mark reply lakshman says july   at  am that your account is verified and is the legit david simon reply lakshman says july   at  am you are already pushing  followers so you may want to look into getting a verified account so people that want to follow david simon actually follow the real one and not some random dude posing as you… reply david simon says july   at  am will let the nice lady managing it know unless it is something i can do myself easily reply kt says august   at  pm this is an accurate summation couple of things  i feel like an ass that i said on here during curfew week in bmore that treme and the wire don’t have twitter accounts and now you’re on twitter well egg’s on my face as a venue i agree it is shit for discourse but it is good for brand promotion and i think you’re very smart to get on there in advance of show me a hero  dunno if you even remember but i’m very sorry that i was an ass to you on here in general during curfew week i did not actually throw your books  movies away i calmed down and got some sleep finally instead in my defense i was and remain under a fair amount of stress as i’m sure the whole city did seeing an armored humvee convey rolling down biddle street is not good for the nerves i also screamed at my own mother and didn’t speak to my best friend for a month if that gives it any context  i’m boycotting hbo right now for a number of reasons but i want to watch smah of course i don’t like to bootleg bc i believe in the value of intellectual property do you get a bigger percentage of the royalties if i buy on dvd as opposed to just watching the channel i might be willing to give hbo my money if the creators get more cash out of the deal thanks in advance… reply rosie says july   at  am this is unrelated but i just wanted to make sure you see this times union dig on the guys who will inherit the medical marijuana industry it’s missing only clay davis httpwwwtimesunioncomtupluslocalarticlecuomoliaisonquietlypushesmarijuanabidphpcmpidtwittermobile reply matt moon says may   at  pm hi david i understand your reticence about publishing free content but i don’t think copyright for the sake of artificial scarcity is as important for the livelihood of artists as you think it is a paradox of markets is that consumption is not necessarily a zerosum game and the “freemium” model of giving something away in order to build a community that generates profits has been one of the most wellproven new economic models of the digital era although for years we were subjected to the droning complaint that the internet and file sharing was killing the music industry an interesting economic study points out that the music industry and pretty much all other entertainment industries have actually continued to grow dramatically since  the only thing that has shrunk in the music industry is the oligopoly of the major record labels—rentseeking middlemen between musicians and their audience—and i consider that a good thing the wonderful thing about “intellectual property” when it is not greedily overpoliced in the name of copyright is that it creates a commonwealth for the people which can be shared by all without anyone losing moreover an old social norm still enshrined in some professional guilds like the american bar association dictates that professionals ought as a duty to give away at least a fraction of the very same labor that they do for a fee to enable those without means to benefit from their skills while i’m on the subject of capitalism i just finished reading a piece you wrote in the guardian in  on the dangerous imbalances in capitalism and the “two americas” in our country it was funny then to read your controversial comment that “if you can’t seek redress and demand reform without a brick in your hand you risk losing this moment for all of us in baltimore” because you probably recall that in that article you ended by saying “i don’t know what we do if we can’t actually control the representative government that we claim will manifest the popular will even if we all start having the same sentiments that i’m arguing for now i’m not sure we can effect them any more in the same way that we could at the rise of the great depression so maybe it will be the brick” now that the brick has been launched at capitalism’s first line of defense—after the obvious lack of effect from all of the mass mobilization this year against racist police authoritarianism—you seem awfully quick to dismiss not only its potential to compel any change but any moral right to even consider its use if not now in the face of such wanton police brutality in a city you know all too well is infamous for racism both de facto and de jure in a year marked by so many public and videodocumented cases of racist police murders across the country then when is that brick ever to be considered even possibly justified or at the very least understood and tolerated without condemnation i’m curious why did you even mention the brick before if you don’t actually ever believe in its use it’s interesting that in the  article you spoke of marx and the existence of “two americas” but made no mention of another famous german political thinker rather more appropriate to the topic ernst fraenkel his work is apropos in the case of baltimore’s current predicament as well because what’s happening is an example and a result of what fraenkel called the “dual state”—a concept originally applied nazi germany—in which there exists a “normative state” dedicated to the preservation of a regularlyfunctioning capitalist society whose members remain generally unthreatened by and unconcerned about the other “prerogative state” which uses brutal violence and arbitrary and restrictive legal controls against a deliberately marginalized and oppressed sector of society the  article and perhaps your response to the baltimore rioting demonstrated a failure to fully understand this dual state leading to some interesting lacunae and rather fuzzy reasoning though you failed to mention it the “two americas” you observed are indeed the normative state– the one you said “is part of the viable america the america that is connected to its own economy where there is a plausible future for the people born into it”—and the prerogative state—which has been “utterly divorced from” your normative experience and which has “no barbed wire around” it but “might as well” perhaps we can say that the “barbed wire” in this case has a human face and a badge and a whole lot of guns and quite obviously the will to use them but your superficial reading of marx made these “two americas” out to be a simple consequence of capitalistic greed not a capitalist necessity enforced by the dual state maintained in subjection by the prerogative state are those individuals who make up “ or  of my country that is no longer necessary to the operation of the economy”—although it would be wrong to discount the role they play in justifying the very large growth sectors in the economy of law enforcement surveillance and incarceration as a result of this blind spot regarding the dual state you were led to conclude that “we’ve somehow managed to march on to two separate futures” without really investigating that “somehow” this quickly made both your reading of history and your beliefs about capitalism problematic when you concluded that american capitalism after world war  was the system that “worked the best” “provided a lot more freedom” and was extremely successful at “creating mass wealth” the caveat is that to the extent that we can even say these statements are true they are true only of the normative state and not of the prerogative state let’s bracket and put aside us foreign policy after world war  which was obsessively dedicated to toppling democratic states all over the world and supporting brutal dictatorships and corrupt cronycapitalist quasidemocratic vassal states in the name of selling “the best product” even inside the united states the claim that the country “provided a lot more freedom” than anywhere else in the aftermath of ww would be looked upon with contempt by those in the prerogative state–the mexicanamerican farm workers for instance who organized marches and boycotts to push back against the exploitation and brutality they faced from their bosses and from the police state or the africanamericans who not only marched boycotted and satin but also responded to the oppression of the white power state with violence and paramilitary organizing i am confident in the contention that the violence and rioting which dr king said was the “language of the unheard” was a central reason why the white power state capitulated and negotiated with king’s nonviolent arm of the “civil rights movement” the history of these activists must not be seen as simply part of america’s glorious struggle for freedom theirs was a desperate response to unfreedom and brutality an act of necessity and one that was inevitably confronted—as the photographic history vividly shows—by the overwhelming presence of armed police secretly they were confronted by the diabolical activities of much more sinister authorities such as the fbi’s cointelpro capitalism is protected from democracy by the police and looking at the state of things today it must be admitted that chavez and king ultimately lost their battles chris rock’s mordant observation that mlk boulevard is the most dangerous street in every american city reveals a darker design at work the movements represented by king and chavez and many other social justice movements were coopted infiltrated and destroyed by the state and this was not incidental to capitalism but in its service there’s a reason beyond effective rhetoric why progressive activists were branded communists by state authorities worldwide today it can be argued that the prerogative state is stronger than ever as you pointed out “the underclass hunted through an alleged war on dangerous drugs that is in fact merely a war on the poor and has turned us into the most incarcerative state in the history of mankind” unfortunately you did not conceptually connect this state authoritarianism and the state of capitalism which it serves which is how you come to the conclusion that the “argument’s over” about capitalism’s necessary goodness that “capitalism has to be the way we generate mass wealth in the coming century” perhaps its a semantic dispute that must be resolved but the “capitalism” that exists today demands the authoritarianism of the dual state and necessarily does not “create mass wealth” broadly for all members of society it’s no coincidence that riots have targeted massive stores like cvs which make their extraordinary profits in direct proportion to the amount they exploit their workers and there is no shortage of baltimoreans speaking out in the same breath about the economic oppression of limited job opportunities and the physical oppression of police harassment violence has surged and will continue to flare up because those within the prerogative state realize what you and others in the normative state cannot believe—there are no legal orderly mechanisms for social justice to triumph over authoritarian capitalism i wouldn’t necessarily condone any particular act of violence but if you’re going to get on your blog and condemn the violent public response to onetoomany flagrant acts of racist police murder you might at least consider what king said when he made the comment about the “language of the unheard” “it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots it would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without at the same time condemning the contingent intolerable conditions that exist in our society these conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention and i must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard” best matt moon reply david simon says may   at  am we all have the king quote memorized me in particular as i am currently developing a miniseries based on the last of the taylor branch trilogy on king for hbo my posted plea against rioting and in favor of mass civil disobedience is consistent with king’s understanding of the root circumstances of a riot and his empathy for the disposessed but inevitability and empathy do not equal approval not to king not to a whole lot of people not to me my opposition is as much strategic as it is moral i believe that civil disobedience — and not unrest violence undercuts progress — is about to become a transformational force in this country but again the thread on this is closed another post rather than this intro thread will advance the discussion soon i hope reply ben merliss says may   at  am you certainly kicked up a lot of dust with that last post mr simon i myself am still struggling with my own perspective on the matter and i don’t think i’ll be at ease with it anytime soon i’m sure it was not easy not only to find the words you wanted to say but also to deal with everyone who took issue with your words i have encountered people calling you “hypocritical” for more than one topic you have addressed i personally feel that while some may genuinely feel they are coming from the right place in doing so others only serve to erode meaning from the word in their own poor judgements it’s a charge that can often be very hurtful and i have been wondering when someone calls you that how do you deal with it how do you deal with the potential feelings that may come with such a charge reply david simon says may   at  am the blog is for argument if we all agreed with each other there would be little purpose in the debate the best debate is that which avoids the worst logical and rhetorical fallacies and focuses on the content explicitly it’s disappointing when people are overcome by personal rancor and fall into namecalling it’s always enough i think to abuse the other fellow’s arguments no need to take it further than that outside of some extreme provocations when it happens here i’m obliged to play defense if i think the personal charge is unwarranted and not let a claim stand if i believe it to untrue but the stakes are small right a blog isn’t exactly a forum where the insults are deep and lasting we are all here digitally as casual acquaintances seeking discussion and debate i’m aware that none of it is personal in the sense that few here know me personally and i assume that if other people or their arguments are similarly bumped it doesn’t exactly cut to the core either for the same reason at least i hope so as there is nothing in this experiment that i want to be purposely hurtful i guess i just assume that those who engage here are interested in a good argument in the first place reply ben merliss says may   at  am well since you find it merely disappointing as opposed to upsetting when people allow their emotions to control their comments you clearly know who you are where you’re coming from and what you are saying whenever you say it that is a strength that many people do not have and i admire you for it it’s certainly something i could learn from my sister once used the term “hypocritical” to describe my inclination to not vote during last years gubernatorial elections when there was so much at stake and so much that could affect me personally although she did know that i had been under extreme stress wondering both if i could truly affect anything by voting and if i could avoid the feeling of having been manipulated by choosing one candidate over the other i just did not know if i could vote without avoiding any fear of negative consequences to myself given that i was skeptical of both candidates so my sisters words did nothing to improve my already troubled conscience only when my father assured me that i must only make the best decision for myself was i able to relax but sometimes my sister’s words still trouble me i do think that your status on the current crisis in baltimore brought out both the best and the worst of those who disagreed with you take a guy like “goat” for instance i’ve never really liked the way he’s put things down in words here because they usually seem rhetorical bordering on silly yet i still wondered if you felt anything came to mind when he claimed instances where he viewed hypocrisy on your part and then there was ned ludd who though ultimately respectful enough in his firm opposition to you could not avoid pulling the “liberal” card on you which always makes me shake my head in bewilderment to me it neither gets to the heart of a matter nor does it make a strong case for the other person’s ideology excusing his or her own rhetorical shortcomings then there were people who relied on rhetoric alone while others tried to defend you when you didn’t do so yourself my assumption was that you felt their word choices spoke for themselves on the other hand others like ellis for instance may not have shared your viewpoints but at least it was clear that their own were well thought out and that they too genuinely believed where they were coming from however there were also a few here and there like kt who…well…i just don’t know what to say hopefully you get my point anyway i appreciate that there are people in the world such as yourself who are confident in your own perspectives and personhoods to the point where you can stand your ground in the face of such opposition perhaps it ought to be this recent peabody conservatory of music graduate’s next big lesson in life reply david simon says may   at  am maybe i’m just a sonofabitch reply kt says may   at  am no offense but i sure do wish you had voted in the state elections if you don’t think ending up with larry hogan was a problem then i encourage you to look more closely at how he is handling the situation now and the fact that he slashed education money the second he got into office that’ll really help baltimore’s problems it shoulda been heather mizeur the only good thing about that election is that i’m pretty sure it shot marty o’malley’s credibility with the dnc to hell and i haven’t heard a peep about his presidential ambitions since reply ben merliss says may   at  am kt i don’t actually live in maryland i was just a music student there for the past four years of my life i did not say where i actually live because i did not think it it was important enough to mention given how much stress i was under thinking about election processes in general i’m not sure it would have made any real difference regardless of whatever state i lived in reply kt says may   at  am that’s cool  i’m not pucking on you i’m just saying the simpld truth lack of voter turnout made a significant difference in the last state election  not a good one reply kt says may   at  am picking not pucking hate the lack of edit ability here reply ben merliss says may   at  am well i appreciate you telling me you’re not trying to pick on me i am sorry about the perceived lack of voter turnouts in maryland during the elections i did develop an affinity for baltimore and i do miss the place but not truly being a citizen of the city or state there was nothing i could have done regardless reply kt says may   at  am now that you put it that way i guess when young men end up “accidentally” deaded by the police in my city and i see harassed schoolchildren being called thugs not by you but avoiding the word doesn’t necessarily avoid the implication i do take it awfully personally that’s just me sorry but i’ll stop bugging you it’s clearly pointless and anyway i already have to go into work on saturday because of this reply kt says april   at  pm just fyi homey no point in shutting down your blog comments to avoid the t i’m serving you i’ve been screencapping everything i’ve said since monday bc i already didn’t trust you turns out i was right may drop them bombs on twitter later but we’ll see if you act right first  made it home safely despite busting the bullshit curfew how’s everybody else doing xoxo reply david simon says may   at  am shut down that thread because of overall redundancy and because i needed to get back to work that’s all the blog requires monitoring of threads because i don’t want it to devolve into the commentary sites of unmonitored shitholes like yahoo or foxnews or whatever so i can only screen so much a day and still get other work done when stuff gets big i go for as long as i can and then when there doesn’t seem to be much fresh stuff coming in i call it after almost  back and forths i called it the last few things that came in were an additional complaint or two from you and others against your point of view and a couple unrelated but repetitive points the webmistress actually posts the terminal message after i call her and tell her it’s done and i did so when the wordpress message list read “” comments remained in the inbox it’s impersonal though clearly you imagine otherwise sorry we all had our say we can’t agree i’m sorry if you feel this blog or its content or its author are not what you would like them to be i have no concerns or issues with that the blog its content and its author are what is intended post anything anywhere else you feel the need that is no concern or issue of mine reply kt says may   at  am oh also overturnthecurfew any onlookers who want to rep that on social media are a blessing sales are down  this week in some small bmore businesses this week and god knows there ain’t no jobs but service jobs in this city and rent’s due reply remina says april   at  pm did you have to add the sexist line about how it’s ok to violate your exgirlfriend’s privacy especially if she’s “notably hot” reply david simon says april   at  pm tongue in cheek sorry i haven’t received a single photograph and would be upset if i did reply remina says april   at  pm that’s good to hear i had to say something especially because of how it was emphasized on its own separate line and as your very last remark i don’t think sounding clever should come at the expense of appearing to condone violations of trust and privacy as well as objectification of women reply david simon says april   at  pm i confess that i’ve made a lot of ugly remarks without intent or from within the context of selfmockery i was raised in a newsroom we did it all the time reply remina says april   at  pm especially considering that revenge porn and harassment of women online are huge problems and women face much more devastating consequences in terms of career reputation and personal safety when their privatepornographic materials are leaked i did find the remark to be very ugly i also wouldn’t say that mistakes in the past are an excuse for mistakes in the present anyway i’m glad you apologized i would prefer to see the line removed but recognize your right to publish what you will and have your work speak for and represent you reply jw says april   at  am shut the fuck up and learn to take a joke reply remina says april   at  pm this is exactly the kind of violent silencing harassment targeted towards women online that i am talking about and part of the reason why i find jokes about the dissemination of their personal materialsinformation online to be unfunny thank you for proving my point jw to be honest i find the topic to be extremely exhausting and depressing and would really much prefer to not have to talk about it at all but as long as it continues i feel very strongly that it cannot be ignored and i will not be silenced reply c says october   at  pm it’s a grueling crusade for the ironyimpaired reply remina says april   at  pm here’s a great video if you’re curious to learn more httpswwwyoutubecomwatchtvbgrlkkevi reply rich says april   at  pm david the familiar sad drama we’ve watched unfold in ferguson and ny has now come to baltimore you have a gift for explaining the tension between law enforcement and the black community and for humanizing both “sides” there’s a reason “inside the interrogation room” is included in crim law textbooks and the wire won so many awards i’m not asking for your position or your solution — just your observations reply sam says march   at  pm you are an excellent writer i find it true that the best writing often comes from some personal experience i’d have to watch the wire to truly see your magnum opus at work of course thanks for your inspiration reply chris says march   at  pm hey david i don’t know if this is something that interests you or if it’s something that those reporters or other readers have asked you about but did you happen to listen to the serial podcast that was released late last year it covered a murder case in the woodlawn neighborhood of baltimore i’m wondering if you have an opinion on it or any insight on the investigation or prosecution based on your experiences and of course your genius insight i will kill … to hear your thoughts thanks chris reply david simon says march   at  pm i haven’t heard it reply chris says march   at  pm thanks david you’re one of my heroes keep fighting the good fight reply amy goodwin says february   at  am iif you are taking requests i’d like to hear about david carr so sad reply brad s says december   at  am david my name is brad and i am currently a second year graduate student in applied sociology at wvu i am originally from harford county md and became hooked on sociology after doing an internship with the baltimore city pd and doing countless hours of ride alongs with them it was fascinating and a life changing experience anyway i am in the middle of reading your book “the corner” and i was just wondering how you obtained that all that datainformation i read somewhere you spent three years working with the community members but couldn’t find much else did you live with them hangout with them etc thanks brad reply chris says november   at  am httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvpcjtedpo – so this apparently happened regarding our discussion about the wire in hd and hbo any clue as to when and how this happened and how it’s going to look some people caught the show in widescreen on amazon streaming httpwwwtivocommunitycomtivovbshowthreadphpt that means they went back to the film elements and got the full frame from it apparently it’s not there anymore reply dea d says september   at  pm after reading a very compelling article at the guardian about david simon where they link this blog i got here only to find david stating verbatim in long anguished prose that he is motivated in this blog by  money and  fear now david being a human and suffering in a personally documented confession i might add from what all humans suffer from will not have the tom because we are not there we are here to appreciate the utter irony or will he david reply david simon says september   at  pm whhaaaat i am motivated by neither money nor fear in regard to this blog indeed this isn’t even my day job given the parttime nature of the thing it could more accurately be said that i am insufficiently motivated at all reply whatmaisieknew says september   at  pm just finished reading the interview in the guardianuk with you regarding your new hbo program show me a hero i happen to live in yonkers very integrated and great coop on rumsey road  and consider the wire the most important and enjoyable drama created for tv i just want to pose a question the guardian headlines your interview “american politics no longer works” while i might slightly disagree in that it rarely ever worked people had to fight and die to change things especially the laborcapital equation slavery women’s rights i think the main question is what do we do to change it granted people may not yet understand that it does not work won’t get better or why it does not work there are a lot of people who instinctively know something is wrong but have no example on what to do about it other than individual solutions usually bad ones that do nothing to change the situation or they just blame themselves for the problem — not the social forces at work i think the main obstruction is the faith that labor leaders black leaders women’s leaders liberals etc put in the democratic party to bring about change i mean i have been following this belief since the ’s and have seen it continuously fail – and look where we are now with “change we can believe in” i do not think the solution is the british labor party model or the social democratic parties in europe but i do think we need to break with both the big business parties whose interests are not with us they are the instrument of the disastrous changes since  both of them they cannot be reformed from within look at the pathetic minor reform ideas of elizabeth warren and how will minimum wage be increased she says thru legislation electing democrats to congress and maybe electing her president legislation may be the mechanism in which the change occurs like civil rights legislation or the once  hour day was passed thru legislation but the real engine of change will be a fight to change the relation of forces as has been done thru out our history but this time the changes needed are so great that nothing less than a political party based upon these struggles these movements — not just an electoral waste of time– will be needed –i think this can only be done with new leadership in labor and all the sections of society that need big changes if we are to prevent ourselves from sinking further when how who well things are beginning to warm up a bit ferguson latest environmental actions fight against right wing maybe not too far away  reply david simon says september   at  pm we are going to have to fight the great economic and sociopolitical battles of the late th and th century all over again and worse because of the inevitability of globalization of both capital and labor we are going to have to do it on an international basis is there consensus for such a fight no will consensus be achieved only when the middle classes fully perceive the long term threat to their viability and begin to restructure their political commitments accordingly will it be too late good question reply whatmaisieknew says september   at  pm i thoroughly agree with you these were the big battles of labor against the injustices of the industrialcapitalist economy on the eve of wwi and thru wwii across europe and to a smaller extent in the us sadly the us failed to build a labor party but instead thanks to roosevelt and the workers organizations that backed him the democratic party became the party of workers minorities etc and we see what happened then though todays european labor parties are for workers in name only i was surprised to learn in a class on european history that the radical workers parties of the th century were huge especially in germany and was one of the reasons the liberal parties become more in favor of reform schools conditions etc in germany for example but as you say all of that is undone which is why we are loosing all those gains we are also in a different world as you say i am not unhappy that this is a global economy with the bulk of industrialization in china i sometimes think that for europe the engine of change is gone it was a result of industrialization social and political turmoil and will pass to the new big industrial enclaves but one never can predict but it is also interesting to see the relationship of the corporations both nationally and globally they really have broken the national boundaries that they fought for in the nineteenth century against the old feudal structure they are really global and the workers are global too things can happen anywhere and they reflect around the world like “hands up don’t shoot” has become a global symbol “our fights are their fights” etc and cannot forget instant information world wide i am generally optimistic barring an environmental or world war catastrophe reply ausin krauss says february   at  pm as you will quickly deduce i am quite naïve and of a fairly modesteducation however in my own personal search for a free just sensibly organized and fully realized life and necessarily the mode of society that would allow for it there is only one avenue that i can think of though i acknowledged the provisional usefulness of socialism and a fairly strong state to implement it i would argue that this cannot be the end state socialism has been illustrated to be if not as alienating as liberal capitalism just as mean and probably more crippling to the realization of a fully realized individual if statesocialism has any usefulness at all and the “if” is stressed it could only be—to my mind—in preparing the soil for or in a dual capacity with the emergence of that peculiar dream of jefferson’s direct democracy i don’t believe that parties or unions are the answer the first political parties emerged in this country in order to defuse the nearly ubiquitous system of townhall democracy that prevailed and the party was similarly employed during the french and late soviet revolution in order to stifle the spontaneous rise of councildemocracy being practiced by common people likewise i feel that unions while provisionally useful only ever end up stifling the original democratic impulse that gave them rise—the most explicit example being the antagonistic role of unions in may  paris i wonder what your thoughts are on this or on the single most successful manifestation of these ideas in modern history the spanish revolution for my part though i personally empathize with the anarchosyndicalist structure in lieu of an industrial proletariat i think that modern councildemocracy would need to be based on the community in which one resides rather than one’s labour affiliations i have never been accused of being a realist yet in many ways i do not think that any of this is possible under current or any conditions at the same time notwithstanding its impossibility it is the only way i see of that is worthy of any earnest human enthusiasm reply brock landers says april   at  pm it will take more than the global middle class to see it’s existence threatened only when the majority of the ownership class finally realizes that it is in their long term best interest to pay working people well reinvest in their businesses before siphoning money to shareholders shore up infrastructure and be held responsible for maintaining the environment will any consequential progress be made as rich as the  are currently they actually stand to gain dramatically if only they realized how important it is to raise the living standards for everyone reply kevin says may   at  pm mr simon i am writing seeking your opinion on the piece “the case for reparations” by tanehisi coates as a black man i feel a weird obligation to defuse things quickly by saying that the reparations argument doesn’t interest me the piece though was disheartening as a black man to read the history of racist practices by the federal government and private industry with regards to housing policies which basically ensured many advantages whites still today benefit from in the article there is the following passage  “in  half the properties in baltimore whose owners had been granted loans by wells fargo between  and  were vacant  percent of these properties were in predominantly black neighborhoods” is there any anecdotal evidence you could provide if possible that could go along with that statistic and the effects it along a history of racist housing practices has had on the communities for which you worked in for and i assume were inspired by i thank you for your time and consideration reply mohamed farhat says may   at  am hi david i’m big fan from libya loved your shows coming from the middle east technically north africa can’t help but talk about foreign politics my question here what’s your take on us foreign politics and war on terror i know it’s very broad question looking forward to your reply regards mohamed reply aaron mirenzi says april   at  am hey david i work at the national institute of drug abuse at their satellite campus at jhu medical center i’ve been given a cool opportunity to host “the house i live in” as a part of nida’s “reel drug” film series i’m excited to be pushing the conversation within the community of the federal government from speaking briefly with nora volkow nida’s director it seems like on a federal level drug research nida and drug enforcement dea function completely independently basically volkow has no political influence over how enforcement actually plays out my aim here is to get folks at nida interested in how the drug war plays out on the ground as opposed to solely in the laboratory anyways i just wanted to share that positive things are happening thanks aaron reply dan says march   at  pm i just caught the last few minutes of you interview on dangerous ideas at the sydney opera house what you said about teaching logical fallacies in school “they really should” really made sense if they did it could massively change the nature of the whole internet people who used the fallacies would be recognised and ignored more often and more meaningful discussions would result and possibly a more meaningful internet ironically everything i know about logical fallacies i have learned from the internet learning some of them has made me a more effective arguer and provided me with more tools to analyse my own thinking reply ag says february   at  pm mr simon i’m africanamerican and was in college at george washington university when the wire first aired that show has had such a massive impact on my life i can’t even quantify it adequately i credit you and howard zinn for really shaping a lot of my views anyway it inspired me to pursue writing and i recently just signed with uta based of a pilot i wrote which is heavily influenced by the wire and the corner i just wanted to say thank you your influence reaches further than you can ever imagine ag reply trackbacks  pingbacks nyc  tv series   priced out says february   at  am …
