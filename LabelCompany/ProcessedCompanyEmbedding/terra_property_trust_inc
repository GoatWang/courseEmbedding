traded common stock of  reits with a value of  we believe that investing a portion of our proceeds from our offering into a diversified portfolio of common and preferred shares of reits and other real estate operating companies will provide our overall portfolio flexibility with nearterm liquidity as well as potentially enhance our nav over a longer period the real estate equity securities portfolio is regularly reviewed and evaluated to determine whether the marketable securities held at any time continue to serve their original intended purposes the following chart summarizes our marketable securities by property type as of december   table of contents image removed rptqchartxaajpg as of december   our top ten holdings in our real estate equity securities portfolio were as

properties inc  alexandria real estate equities inc  essex property trust inc  avalonbay communities inc  total   market outlook commercial real estate had a strong year during  for the most part demand continued to outstrip supply pushing vacancy rates lower and rents higher commercial real estate prices generally ended the year above where they started delivering total returns to core real estate in line with the historical average for commercial real estate in more subtle ways however we believe the landscape began to shift while fundamentals were strong financialmarket volatility curbed the decline of capitalization rates that had powered capital gains since  total annual returns on an unleveraged basis slipped into the single digits for the first time since the recent financial crisis we believe that commercial real estate will deliver a similar return profile over the next five years given that supply is generally moderate and shows tentative signs of peaking we believe that real estate is positioned to generate healthy net operating income growth at the same time rising interest rates and temperate capital flows directly into commercial real estate are expected to put modest upward pressure on capitalization rates slowing the pace of appreciation we expect table of contents total annual unleveraged returns on commercial real estate will be primarily income driven averaging  annually through   over the next two years while a more normalized return profile may be disappointing to some investors in our view it represents a soft landing that should be welcomed we believe the us economy does not suffer from overt excesses such as inflation or asset bubbles that have precipitated past recessions we believe supply is generally under control real estate is not overleveraged and valuations are not stretched on a relative basis in this context a moderation of returns should help extend the duration of the cycle or in a worst case scenario cushion the severity of any downturn which we continue to believe is several years off results of operations we commenced operations on may   upon receipt of  in proceeds from our sponsor in our initial public offering on may   we acquired our first property and made our initial investments in marketable securities since then and through december   we acquired seven additional properties and significantly increased our outstanding debt balance as described above under portfolio informationreal estate portfolio in addition we expect to continue to raise additional capital increase our borrowings and make future acquisitions which we believe will have a significant impact on our future results of operations comparison of year ended december   to year ended december   revenues our rental income increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   our tenant reimbursement income increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   our  rental and tenant reimbursement income increased from  due to the property acquisitions occurring during  and  as described above under portfolio informationreal estate portfolio also included in our  rental and tenant reimbursement income is approximately  related to the fully amortized below market lease liability at terra nova plaza for the sports authority inc in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings of the sports authority inc on june   dicks sporting goods inc won the right at auction to assume andor negotiate a new lease for the space at terra nova plaza occupied by the sports authority inc in september  we executed a year lease with dicks sporting goods inc which was subsequently approved by the bankruptcy court on september   at which time dicks sporting goods inc became the tenant effectively terminating the lease with the sports authority inc at such time all remaining lease intangibles related to the sports authority inc were fully amortized through the lease termination date straight line revenues increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   the increase in straight line revenues for  over  was due to our additional property acquisitions typically our leases have contractual base rent increases which cause corresponding decreases in the straight line rent adjustments once effective in addition we recognized approximately  of straight line revenue for the year ended december   from the lease with dicks sporting goods inc a result of the lease beginning in september  but cash base rent not commencing until march   heritage parkway wallingford plaza commerce corner anaheim hills office plaza and terra nova plaza represent our samestore real estate investments for the years ended december   and  being the properties owned for the entirety of both periods for those properties property income was up  in  compared to  primarily due to  from the full amortization of the below market lease liability related to the termination of the lease with the sports authority inc as described above base rental income had a minimal change over the prior period as contractual base rent increases at the properties were offset by three months of free rent at terra nova plaza related to the lease with dicks sporting goods inc straight line revenue increased by approximately  primarily a result of the  recognized from the dicks sporting goods inc lease offsetting decreases from the other properties in addition the  period saw increased tenant reimbursements of approximately  primarily related similar increases in recoverable operating expenses our investment income on marketable securities increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   the increase in investment income was due to certain securities providing greater distributions in  as a result of asset sales such greater distributions may not continue in future periods the portfolio is regularly adjusted by increasing and decreasing specific holdings primarily based upon table of contents changes in sector allocations and to a lesser degree based upon performance of specific securities proceeds from sale of securities are primarily reinvested in the common stock of other publicly traded reits thereby keeping a base of investments that generate dividend income as of december   our real estate equity securities portfolio had a total investment cost of  all of our investment income on marketable securities for the years ended december   and  was comprised of dividend income from these investments expenses our total expenses for the years ended december   and  were  and  respectively for the years ended december   and  general and administrative expenses were  and  respectively our general and administrative expenses include a variety of corporate expenses the largest of which were audit fees legal fees professional fees directors and officers insurance and independent director compensation the amount for the  period is higher than  primarily due to higher audit fees and other professional fees related to tax and compliance property operating expenses for the years ended december   and  were  and  respectively the increase in property operating expenses from  to  is primarily due to the  property acquisitions occurring late in the year as described above under portfolio informationreal estate portfolio in addition we recognized approximately  of bad debt expense during the year ended december   related to the bankruptcy filing of the sports authority inc for the years ended december   and  depreciation was  and  respectively and amortization was  and  respectively depreciation and amortization also increased in the  period compared to the  period as a result of the additional acquisitions furthermore the  period includes  in amortization expense due to the full amortization of the acquired intangible lease assets related to the sports authority inc lease on a samestore basis for heritage parkway wallingford plaza commerce corner anaheim hills office plaza and terra nova plaza property operating expenses for the year ended december   increased by approximately  compared to the same period of  primarily due to  of bad debt expense and to a lesser degree legal costs at terra nova plaza related to the bankruptcy of the sports authority inc in addition we recognized increased real estate taxes of approximately  primarily related to commerce corner on a samestore basis amortization increased approximately  primarily due to the additional amortization related to the sports authority inc lease as noted above however depreciation for the year ended december   was consistent with the year ended december   the fixed component of the advisory fee is equal to  per annum of the nav for each share class and is calculated and accrued daily and reflected in our nav per share for the years ended december   and  the fixed component of the advisory fee was  and  respectively the fixed component of the advisory fee was not earned by our advisor until our combined nav for all share classes reached  which occurred on january   the increase in the fixed component of the advisory fee is due to the additional capital raised during  as well as an increase to our nav resulting from appreciation of our real estate investments acquisition related expenses during the years ended december   and  were  and  respectively the  amount related to our acquisition of allied drive and the  amount related primarily to our acquisitions of the flats at carrs hill and loudoun gateway acquisition related expenses during the year ended december   also included costs related to pursuit of acquisitions that we ultimately decided not to complete table of contents we expect our acquisition related expenses depreciation amortization and property operating expenses to increase in future periods because we anticipate acquiring additional properties in the future interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense was  compared to  for the same period in  this increase was primarily due to a greater weighted average outstanding aggregate loan balance due to additional borrowings on our line of credit related to acquisitions which occurred in the second half of  and late  the weighted average outstanding balance on our line of credit was  million for the year ended december   as compared to  million for the year ended december   the increase in our weighted average balance on our line of credit was attributable to our ownership of a greater number of properties during  as compared to  additionally contributing to the increased interest expense in the  period compared to the  period is the long term property specific loans that were originated in  on march   we originated a  loan for the    mar   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from
