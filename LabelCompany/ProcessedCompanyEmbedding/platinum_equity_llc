holland berger jacobs and ridgely justices constituting the court en banc steele chief justice platinum equity llc platinum scheduled to acquire certain of rohn industries incs rohn assets before the end of  terminated an asset purchase agreement with rohn under a provision that allowed for termination if platinum determined in good faith that there was a reasonable basis in law and in fact to conclude that platinum could reasonably be anticipated to incur any material asbestos related liability after consummating the acquisition the parties agree that new york law governs their dispute over the contract language the trial judge determined that platinum had no objective basis in law or in fact to terminate the agreement the trial court held nevertheless that platinum had properly terminated the agreement because it objectively believed in good faith that it would incur a material asbestosrelated liability after consummating the acquisition rohn now appeals contending that the trial judge erred by failing to recognize that under new york law in these circumstances judicial review must also include review for objective reasonableness we agree and affirm in part reverse in part and remand with instructions to enter judgment for rohn facts and procedural history on november   plaintiffappellant rohn and defendantappellee platinum entered into an asset purchase agreement under which platinum would acquire certain of rohns assets related to the manufacture of cell phone towers  platinum buys and sells companies and is accustomed to completing purchases under expedited conditions for this reason when rohn advertised that its assets were for sale and stated its desire to consummate the sale by the end of  platinum was one of two companies that came forward as a viable purchaser when platinum began its due diligence it learned that rohn previously had been a division of unr industries a successor to unarco industries inc which before  made products with asbestos platinum also learned that in  as a result of asbestos liabilities unr had filed for bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois although the liabilities relating to asbestos had been channeled to a trust and rohn had since separated from unr and rohn had never manufactured products with asbestos platinum requested that a termination clause be added to the agreement the termination provision allowed platinum to terminate the agreement if platinum determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis in law and in fact to conclude that    as a result of the consummation of the rohn transaction platinum could reasonably be anticipated to have any    material liability for any asbestosrelated claim    this termination provision enabled the parties to progress toward an end of the year closing which for rohn to achieve  million in tax refunds was vital to rohn yet also permitted platinum to continue conducting due diligence with regard to asbestos related liabilities after consulting with independent expert legal counsel platinum concluded that the transaction would expose platinum to material asbestos related liability and citing the termination provision purported to terminate the agreement on december   rohn could not find another purchaser before the end of  and lost millions in tax refunds as a result rohn filed this action on april   seeking damages for breach of contract based upon platinums allegedly wrongful termination of the parties asset purchase agreement a superior court judge tried the case without a jury from december  to   heard testimony from  witnesses and admitted more than  exhibits rohn sought to establish liability by showing that platinums concern about asbestos liability which prompted platinum to terminate the agreement was not objectively reasonable and that new york law which governed the agreement dictated that an objective as well as subjective standard be employed to determine whether platinum had properly terminated the agreement platinum defended on the ground that it was entitled to invoke the termination provision as long as it determined in good faith that there were reasonable grounds to fear material asbestos related liability  irrespective of whether or not its determination was objectively reasonable in the alternative platinum sought to establish that its determination was in fact objectively reasonable rohn appealed on november  from the superior courts november   opinion and order that granted judgment to platinum on all of rohns claims the trial judge found that the plain language of the provision conferred discretion on platinum to terminate the agreement so long as it behaved in good faith notably however the trial judge also held that platinums decision to terminate was objectively unreasonable  after hearing the parties argue on june   we asked the parties to address in supplemental memoranda exactly what under new york law the parties meant by the agreement language material liability for any asbestosrelated claim the parties filed supplemental memorandums on this issue discussion the primary issue on appeal is whether the trial judge limited her review to only a good faith analysis of platinums decision to terminate and whether she properly did so the trial judge found no legal theory under which platinum in buying nonasbestos assets for value in a nonmerger could have inherited asbestos related liability indeed the trial judge determined that unrs rohns predecessor asbestos liability was permanently discharged and enjoined so no liability would pass to platinum but the trial judge applied a purely subjective standard in holding that platinum in good faith believed that it would incur material asbestos related liability from the transaction and that therefore platinum had properly terminated the agreement on that basis alone on appeal rohn argues that the trial judge legally erred by applying a strictly subjective standard rohn contends that under new york law the termination provision prescribes an objective standard under which a court can review for reasonableness and that the trial judge herself found that platinums belief that it could reasonably be anticipated to have    material liability for any asbestosrelated claim    was manifestly unreasonable in response platinum argues that the trial judge correctly held that platinums decision to terminate is only properly reviewed as a good faith subjective belief in the alternative platinum argues that it had a reasonable basis in law and in fact to conclude objectively that it could reasonably anticipate incurring material asbestos related liability if it acquired rohns assets we review both the trial judges interpretation of the agreements language and her legal conclusions de novo we review the trial judges factual findings for clear error alone contrary to the trial judges determination new york law follows the restatement second of contracts  in applying provisions akin to the termination clause at issue section  provides an objective standard namely that when it is a condition of an obligors duty that he be satisfied with respect to the obligees performance or with respect to something else and it is practicable to determine whether a reasonable person in the position of the obligor would be satisfied an interpretation is  preferred under which the condition occurs if such a reasonable person in the position of the obligor would be satisfied as judge posner explained in morin bldg prods co v baystone constr inc this rule of construction embodies the presumption that the performing party would not have wanted to put himself at the mercy of the paying partys whim section  reflects longstanding new york law as the new york court of appeals held in alper blouse co v ee connor  co while the power to withhold approval is an untrammeled one where the object of the contract is to gratify taste serve personal convenience or satisfy individual preference a different rule ordinarily prevails in this state for commercial contracts where the suitability of the goods is a matter of mechanical fitness utility or marketability in such a case the contract is construed as imposing upon the seller the requirement only that a reasonable man    be satisfied with the performance this rule dates back to the th century that which the law shall say a contracting party ought in reason to be satisfied with that the law will say he is satisfied with alper blouse and section  remain new york law for example in jd cousins  sons the second circuit in a diversity case applying new york law heard an appeal from a case for breach of a contract to perform boiler inspection services the contract contained a clause that permitted the inspector to make inspections as he may deem necessary to permit him to certify to the best of his belief that the boilers complied with applicable codes like the trial judge here the district court held that words such as as he may deem necessary and to the best of his belief made this a subjective discretionary determination that the court could not review save for good faith the second circuit disagreed citing to alper blouse it ruled that under new york law  the objective standard was intended to apply in this case whether a vessel complies with the applicable asme standard and is safe are clearly both external and objective facts similar to issues of merchantability operative fitness or mechanical utility which are typically adjudicated under the standard of objective reasonableness similarly in rus inc v bay indus inc the us district court for the southern district of new york held that when a contract conditions one partys reasonable performance on that partys satisfaction courts impose a duty of good faith and fair dealing that requires the terminating party to exercise its discretion as would a reasonable person in rus the agreement at issue specified various conditions that one party had to fulfill before the other partys obligation to consummate the contract arose among those obligations was the sellers duty to deliver the result of an environmental assessment and audit of the facilities it was selling the provision at issue conditioned the buyers performance on the buyers reasonable satisfaction with the report the court held that whether the buyers dissatisfaction with the report was unreasonable depended upon whether a reasonably prudent buyer would have been sufficiently satisfied with the report to proceed with the transaction the court further ruled that to determine whether the buyers dissatisfaction was reasonable therefore the factfinder will have to ascertain the severity of the problems disclosed and consider them in light of the transaction as a whole platinum argues that the foregoing authorities are inapposite because the rule that satisfaction be measured against a reasonableness standard is a default rule that applies only when the parties have not agreed to the contrary here platinum argues the parties agreed to the contrary by drafting the termination provision to read if platinum determines in good faith    to support its contention however platinum relies on case law that actually supports rohns position in morin bldgs prods co v baystone constr inc judge posner recognizing that the requirement of reasonableness may be overcome if the parties expressly contract for a purely subjective standard opined that the presumption that the performing party would not have wanted to put himself at the mercy of the paying partys whim is overcome when the nature of the performance contracted for is such that there are no objective standards to guide the court  thus the key question in this case as derived from section  and new york case law is whether it is possible to determine objectively whether a reasonable person in platinums position would have been satisfied by the protections against asbestos related liability as distinguished from whether platinum itself in good faith concluded the protections were unsatisfactory the trial courts determination that there was no basis in law or fact for terminating the agreement demonstrates selfevidently that this question is in fact answerable here there were objective standards to guide the trial judge and based on those standards she concluded that platinum acted unreasonably because there are objective standards to guide the courts assessment of the reasonableness of platinums termination we hold that the trial judge erred in applying a subjective good faith analysis to determine that platinum properly terminated the agreement we find that new york law demands that the termination of a contract in reliance upon a satisfaction clause be objectively reasonable where there are as here objective standards to guide the court because the record fully supports the trial judges conclusion that there were no objective bases in law or fact for terminating the agreement we affirm that holding conclusion new york law demands that court review of the termination of a contract in reliance upon a satisfaction clause be objectively reasonable where there are objective standards to guide the court we find that the record fully supports the trial judges holding that there were no objective bases in law or fact for terminating the agreement we therefore affirm that holding the trial judge however applied only a good faith subjective standard in determining that platinum properly terminated the agreement we therefore must reverse the judgment and remand the case to the superior court to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiffbelowappellant jurisdiction is not retained notes
