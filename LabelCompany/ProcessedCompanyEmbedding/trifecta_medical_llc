starsthe best formula for those with serious medical conditions by sally on january   item package quantity  for those with any kind of colitis or taking medicines causing chronic potassium deficiency this is the formula you want most other formulas don’t have enough of the salts andor leave out essential ingredients for absorption use the wrong sugars or include magnesium stearate many people think the salt and glucose are things to be avoided but for rehydration you absolutely have to have some sodium and glucose in the formula in the correct amounts in order for water to be absorbed in the intestines the formulas that don’t have either are a waste of money the gatorade and powerade formulas are very poor if you need to drink rehydration fluid every day as i do this who formula is the best you can get a box of  is  cents a day none of the other products come close to being that affordable i don’t mind the taste at all asis having gotten used to it quickly but if it doesn’t do it for you you can stir in a packet or two of the true brand unsweetened  citrus flavor packets without messing up the formula not bad at all a good coconut water like taste nirvana from whole foods is the next best thing but very expensive for any length of time these who formula packets have literally been a lifesaver for me and i highly recommend them a sidenote last year i got a giant bulk box of the who formula packets by jianas brothers which are the old formula now being phased out i was unhappy amazon is not offering them in bulk this year until i discovered who reworked the formula

by julia on august   item package quantity  verified purchase this stuff has transformed my health and well being formerly always dehydrated but no more i drink  liters of this a day and my night time dry eye issues are a thing of the past not to mention how much better i feel in the day i bring packets of this on vacation too – of all times you want to feel your best on vacation this is the lowest cost of all the who formula packets out there and there are only a few that actually stick to the who formula with no other additives such as sucralose etc i sweeten it a bit with my own sweeter of choice because i admit it does not taste that great straight – but since it’s a simple and pure “base” formula the nice thing is you can use what you personally feel comfortable with to sweeten andor flavor it julia trioral oral rehydration salts httpwwwamazoncomreviewrrergfceuxrefcmcrdptitleieutfasinbogguchanneldetailglancenodeidstorehpc – amazon  out of  starsa must have to combat dehydration by
