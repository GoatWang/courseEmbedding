governmenteducation healthcare hospitality quick serve restaurant retail contact us approach the iteam difference       iteam has invested millions of dollars in rd to develop an advanced system of productization and structured management applied to the contingent workforce resource selection work delivery process and work product  we utilize a combination of proprietary software knowledge bases vetting techniques and process optimization methods that offer enterprises a better way to utilize contingent labor to deliver onpremise technology services by anticipating the common things that go wrong in an onpremise event and building proactive steps into our delivery engine to mitigate them before they occur our exception rates are xx lower than traditional workforce management approaches  iteams contingent workforce solutions are being used by leading companies to deliver high volume nationwide technology deployments with predictable cost consistent quality and high customer satisfaction iteam leaves little to chance traditional contingent workforce approaches rely on the individual experiences and delivery preferences of each technician and then “hope for the best” with respect to technology deployment and support outcomes  our contingent workforce approach leaves little to chance with a detailed endtoend process that optimizes consistency and quality across one or multiple events  it begins with the “productization” of the delivery and installationsupport protocols developing and documenting best practice approaches to the work being provided  then a preinstallation readiness assessment is performed at each installation location to collect the site specific nuances  this sitespecific information is combined with a standard scope and bestpractices protocol to create precise and unique statementsofwork sow’s and technician work orders for each and every location  sow’s are provided to site contacts and work orders are electronically routed to our professional technicians to initiate the onpremise delivery  a service advisor oversees each event from onset to completion interacting with the site contact technician and project management to ensure a successful completion  the service advisor tracks the progress of each service event and facilitates any situation that may come up in the field  we utilize proprietary iplatform software to execute with efficiency and comprehensive detail  our technicians deliver the service as described in the productized work order and alert the service advisor immediately with any impediments that would preclude doing so we strongly discourage “free lancing” or creative activity by our field techs unless we’ve tasked them specifically with an open ended troubleshooting task the result is higher quality and increased customer satisfaction at first glance all of this meticulous process and execution may sound expensive but it is not  because of the efficiencies and automation support builtin to our proprietary underlying iplatform infrastructure it has proven to be more economical than traditional models iteams approach is more economical companies that utilize iteam often tell us that our expectation setting responsiveness communications level service quality and attention to detail are significantly better than other workforce management approaches that theyve experienced  they also tell us that when they compare the overall cost service price service event overheadmanagement time remediation time and user satisfaction of iteam with that of other approaches iteam is significantly more economical  company corporate profile careers news  events blog contact us contact us iteam inc  tadmuck rd suite  westford ma  tel  fax 0 infoiteamcom approach iteam difference
