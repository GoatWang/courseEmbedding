to buy veeva systems inc stock and never sell  the motley fool skip to main content the motley fool foolcom foolcouk foolcomau foolca foolsg foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search  reasons to buy veeva systems inc stock and never sell the first is the most important and i truly hope the last never comes true brian stoffel tmfcheesehead jul   at pm a little over a decade ago peter gassner was an executive at salesforcecom nysecrm while he was out pushing the companys cloud services he noticed something the pharmaceutical industry had very specific needs that salesforcecom couldnt easily meet taking that information he left salesforcecom to found veeva systems nyseveev where he still functions as the companys ceo he started his work with veeva crm a customer relationship management tool for big pharma then he really hit it out of the park with veeva vault a product that helps companies manage  in the simplest sense  all of the data that they need to track to obtain fda approval for their drugs image source getty images i first purchased shares of veeva in january of  have added to it since and have no plans to sell here are  reasons why  its got a strong moat imagine having all of your customer information on one platform then imagine having all of the data that youve collected from test results on the same platform now imagine you have to transfer all of that data to another platform the horror not only would this be prohibitively expensive it would also create massive headaches entire workforces would have to be retrained on a new system and if any of this missioncritical data were lost it would be a major liability in the investing world we call those high switching costs  momentum is strong of course high switching costs mean absolutely nothing if you cant win over customers in the first place luckily for veeva investors however momentum has been very strong veevas growth across service productscreate column charts perhaps most importantly the number of vault customers using more than one vault application grew  by the end of the first quarter of   optionality abounds optionality is a complicated word for a simple concept make lots of small bets and look for just one or two to hit it big after you see how a small bet performs you have the option to either pursue it further or kill it for the first time veeva is really branching out on a small bet it recently made word of mouth about the ease and functionality of veeva vault has led companies outside of big pharma to start asking for a version that they can use specifically this demand has come from industries that are heavily regulated consumer packaged goods cpg chemicals and manufacturing starting this year vault qualityone a hybrid vault product is on the market for companies outside of life sciences to use already a topfive cpg company has signed on  management has skin in the game no one knows more about the hidden risks of a company than those that are managing it thats why i think its so important to invest in companies where management has their own skin in the game via stock ownership peter gassner owns almost  million class b shares while cofounder gordon ritter owns nearly  million combined these two control just under  of all voting rights and their stake is currently worth  billion  i love founderled companies as you can tell im a fan of skin in the game but theres a class above skin in the game bestselling author and trader nassim taleb calls it having your soul in the game thats when someone takes risks on behalf of the greater community thats what we have with gassner most of his wealth is tied up in veeva but beyond that founders often view their companies as extensions of themselves and are committed to building lasting value  employees seem to like it while some think culture isnt important and impossible to measure id point you toward glassdoorcom while the site isnt perfect  and is certainly open to manipulation  it offers an important data point for those wanting to learn about the morale of a company currently veeva has pretty solid marks across the board image source glassdoorcom    theres a strong balance sheet with positive cash flows every company at one point or another is going to go through difficult economic times those that have solid balance sheets and positive cash flows can often emerge from these times even stronger thats because they can acquire weaker rivals buy back shares on the cheap or  most importantly  offer deals that the competition cant and steal longterm market share heres what the story looks like for veeva right now cash debt net income free cash flow  million   million  million data source yahoo finance thats financial fortitude  customer concentration is low companies that have solid balance sheets like that are in great shape but they sometimes hide a dangerous risk  relying on just a few customers for a huge part of their revenue when thats the case all it takes is one decision coming from one person to sink a company overnight luckily for veeva thats not the current situation as the chart in the second point above shows it has hundreds of different customers and no single customer currently accounts for more than  of total revenues for the past three years  who knows what will be next three years ago crm accounted for virtually all sales almost overnight vault has become an enormous contributor veeva revenue by segmentcreate column charts veevas two newer products  opendata and network  probably wont hit the ball out of the park quite like vault but they dont have to the company continues to innovate and with each new customer the moat surrounding veeva widens  a takeover candidate personally i wouldnt be a very big fan of a takeover i think veeva has enormous potential moving forward  with the move outside of big pharma being a cherry on top but the fact remains that veeva clearly has a lot of momentum going for it thats tempting to a lot of deeppocketed competitors in the cloud space while the stock certainly seems expensive right now i wouldnt at all be surprised to see a cloud giant swoop in and pay around  billion for veeva so there you have it  reasons i own and plan to hold on to veeva systems stock  and why you might want to consider the stock as well brian stoffel owns shares of veeva systems the motley fool owns shares of and recommends veeva systems the motley fool recommends salesforcecom the motley fool has a disclosure policy

reimagining the customer onboarding experience with box salesforce docparser twilio and stamplaythis post was written by david majetic an enterprise sales engineer at boxmy current mission at box is to lead up sales engineering for box canada i am tasked to take our company vision for cloud content management and inspire my prospects and customers to think differently on how they manage and access their content in my experience the best conversations i have had often come after showing a live demo of a use case that not only incorporate box products but also include other products that may be complementary or already in use in a companywith this post i’m going to show you one of the demos that i recently put together for a customer i pulled this together using a loan origination sample application built on box platform the box salesforce connector the stamplay lowcode development platform and apis from docparser and twilio the specific demo scenario is a customer uploading a loan request to a banking website that includes uploading a document the document is uploaded to box using our api and app user model and sent to a “loan applications” folder in box upon upload the file is sent to docparser a data extraction tool for pdfs for parsing and the derived metadata extracted by docparser is stored back to box as metadata on the file and also used to create a lead record in salesforce the agent is then sent a notification that a new request has been submitted generated using the twilio api that they can review the lead record in salesforce and review associated documents using the box for salesforce connector the agent reviews the loan application and if everything looks ok they trigger a docusign flow using the box for docusign integration when the customer signs the document using docusign it is automatically saved back to box and the agent is sent a notification with a url to the signed document using the twilio apimost companies today run processes like loan origination off of a legacy onpremise ecm solution if they’ve managed to make the process selfserve it’s by investing a lot in custom application development using the ecm solution primarily for secure retention of content more likely the process is manual with paper documents or email box gives you another option because box is agnostic to the user interface experiences can be designed that flow content through our firstparty web and mobile apps the applications that we integrate with like salesforce docusign and microsoft office and your custom applications that consume our apis this means that you can drive full endtoend experiences like onboarding a new customer with unified content storage and governance through box notice that we’re referring to “experiences” and not “processes” the ultimate goal is to have ondemand access to content in any experience you are creating or any business application you are usingsupporting experiences like the onboarding process just described is possible because box is both a saas application and also available as a suite of cloud content management apis known as box platform that can be used to embed cloud content management into your own applications depicted below you can see box as one of the saas providers that companies use to run their business but also box platform as an api provider similar to twilio stripe or sendgrid with which companies can build digital experiences in the same way that twilio provides messaging services for your applications box provides content management services for your applicationswhat this means for our customers is that content can be seamlessly surfaced through prebuilt integrations with business applications like microsoft office  salesforce adobe and docusign to name a few in addition when your content management system is in the cloud it can and must be the same system that powers content experiences for custom applications for customers and employees if we are to deliver on the promise of digitali thought of a quick way to demonstrate the value of our functional paas and saas offerings in action one of the benefits of cloud is that it allows you to prototype solutions faster fail faster and — most importantly — deliver faster everything i built here can be done for free by signing up for developer accounts my whole thought process was to not build an endtoend solution but to show how you can connect some bestofbreed technologies to create building blocks my customers could then incorporate and take to the next level i used what could be considered part of a mortgage application process but it really could be anything involving documents notifications and customer recordsi was able to do this fairly quickly using stamplay which is a low code platform that easily allows you to run workflow logic across paas and saas solutions this is a growing area of interest for box as more content plays are requiring on demand services other solutions in the mixsalesforce integration with box — prebuilt with box saas solutiondocusign — prebuilt with box’s saas applicationadobe — a prebuilt integration with box edittwilio — stamplay connector for sms messagingdocparser — stamplay connector for pdf document parsingocrcustom web app — using the box app user authentication modelapp users are fullfeatured enterprise box accounts that belong to your application not a box enduser unlike typical box accounts these accounts do not have an associated login and can only be accessed through the content api by the controlling application and associated box user id this new user model allows your application to take advantage of groups permissions collaborations comments tasks and the many other features offered by the box platform to create whitelabeled content experiences your custom applications have users that are now part of a content management process a content securityidentity model for users in any application gives you an audit trail for compliance alleviates building one on your own trust us — it’s hard and allows your content to be ported to other applications as opposed to using a repository for dumb storage and all

fasterhere are the two high level stamplay flow recipesthey key to this flow was create the necessary fields on the lead salesforce object record from the docparser variables and create a frup table record in salesforce the frup table is basically an intersection table that tells our integration package which box folder our embed technology should point for a given salesforce recordthis opens up endless possibilities for box content to follow the salesforce record use cases could include sales claims work orders case management and digital vaults in portal oriented applications the ability to have instant access to the same repository another user be it employee or customer is experiencing in another application is transformationalfor a closer look at the stamplay flows i have created

over  copies and the cofounder of growth marketing agency web profits a marketing veteran he’s led the digital marketing strategy for companies like sales force mint intuit and many other top companies patel’s goal is to help entrepreneurs and marketers scale their businesses sujanpatel cofounder web profitssujanpatel write a comment credit getty images seventyone percent of companies say closing more deals is their number one priority for sales according to hubspots state of inbound report yet many organizations are still following outdated sales processes its time to step into the future and embrace sales automation sales automation streamlines your sales process and ensures your team is focused on the right opportunities and isnt wasting time on routine or tedious tasks the more you can use technology to automate your sales process the more time your team will spend actually making sales in an interview with martech advisor tiffani bova global customer growth and innovation evangelist at salesforce said the collision of speed technology and customer experience is challenging sales organizations of all sizes to do a hard reset on what they have done in the past to improve sales performance doing what youve always done wont get you the results you want moving forward you need to adapt your processes to changing mindsets and practices heres where you should focus your automation efforts within your sales process  outreach whether youre calling emailing or visiting in person keeping in communication with your clients and prospects eats up a lot of your time leaving room for little else but following up on a lead is one of the most important tasks for a sales rep in fact  of sales require at least five phone calls after meeting for the first time according to the marketing donut but remembering and trying to fit in those five phone calls can be a real challenge when youre trying to balance a number of clients on her blog motivational speaker patricia fripp writes it is not your clients job to remember you it is your obligation and responsibility to make sure you are unforgettable to streamline your client communication invest in a system that will manage it for you look for a customer relationship management or crm system that allows you to make phone calls and send emails directly in the system this way you wont have to log your communication the system will do it for you and youll have a complete record of your communication with each client to reference in the future  lead prioritization you know you need to stay on top of all of your contacts but with so many to manage it can be overwhelming but by automating your lead prioritization you wont have to worry about making sure you follow up on all leads your system should choose the leads to contact for you through a lead scoring system you can set rules that will prioritize the most important leads the lead scoring program will analyze all of your leads and their engagement and rank them based on their likelihood to convert when you go to contact a lead youll also get a clear picture of their history with your company and past communication which will allow you to better communicate with them you can see from prospect tracking what stage a prospect is within the funnel and from that you can determine what vernacular and language you should use as you talk about your product said phil simpson regional vice president of sales at salesforce in an interview with salesforces pardot team and you can preempt any roadblocks or rejections by seeing how they interact with your web properties  lead distribution when a lead comes in it can sometimes take awhile before the sales manager sees it and assigns it to a sales rep by the time the rep follows up on that lead it could be too late skip the middleman and let your crm system rotate leads instead of your manager that way the manager can spend more time coaching reps and helping to close deals according to gartner companies that automate lead management see a  or greater increase in revenue in just six to nine months by automating your lead distribution youre not only saving time  youre also earning more money leads shouldnt be distributed at random instead set up criteria that make sense for your organization such as assigning each rep to a specific territory or region  reporting research from hubspot finds  of sales reps still use informal means such as microsoft excel or outlook to store their lead and customer data and  are spending an hour or more on data entry each and every day reporting is crucial to your ongoing success and continued improvement but if youre spending too much time generating reports and not enough time making sales your priorities need to be rearranged your crm system can set up automated reports for you you can even schedule them to be sent to your email every day that way youll have a daily reminder of your progress and itll be simple to show leadership how youre doing when they inquire  final steps once youve made a deal its time to tie up any loose ends including contracts and payments make these processes simple by using automated software such as docusign and paypal instead of having to chase down the customers signature or dealing with checks and invoices your systems will handle it all when looking for a crm system look for one that can integrate with other forms of technology youre using but above all make sure the system suits your needs the needs of your sales team and the needs of your business in an interview with martech series marketo ceo steve lucas said my advice would be to ensure the platform that you choose can scale to meet the demands of your organization is open to fit into your current and future technology systems and enables your teams to engage uniquely and authentically with every person have you automated your sales process what technology did you find useful share your thoughts in the comments below the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those of inccom published on jul   this week in scalability system backups in the container era  the new stack search for search for digest  research  technology  top stories  global this week in scalability system backups in the container era am by joab jackson  “to be clear i am a believer in decentralization having built systems with that i can tell you it is not the magic dust you are looking for” — amazon web services chief technology officer werner vogels  as we gear up to release our next ebook on the kubernetes open source container orchestration engine check with us in about a month we have been reviewing how well ks has been making its way into the enterprise — the true determinant of whether the software becomes an essential component of “the new stack” so to speak reviewing our notes from kubecon  held earlier this year in berlin we found some powerful testimonies from both salesforce and comcast salesforce is using it in a pilot program to power three cloudnative services with plans to be running  services by the end of the year when the company’s engineers were considering different orchestration options they immediately appreciated the smarts behind the kubernetes after all many had come from other jobs managing large atscale workloads “we were frankly blown away the development velocity was incredible even back then” salesforce principal architect steve sandke said of the developers behind kubernetes “these people clearly knew what they were doing” comcast has found that not only does kubernetes easily scale applications but even helps scale it operations teams its use of kubernetes is all about “decoupling the operations of engineering teams at an organization and giving them a platform to manage their own large complicated distributed systems as easily as i can manage my linux box” comcast’s richard fliam said not only would this approach cut deployment time for apps it also cuts the amount of time staff has to spend in documentation and the communication required across groups elsewhere we found that — surprise — even microsoft is using kubernetes which it needed to quickly roadtest the then upcoming release of a version of sql server  that was ported to linux  originally it would take microsoft an entire night to run  tests of the containerized sql server with kubernetes however the time needed to complete those tests shrank to a few hours this week in numbers java vs javascript a weekly chart and commentary from tns research analyst lawrence hecht with nodejs’s use on the serverside comparing javascript and java is no longer apples vs oranges with that context it is noteworthy that last year the number of npm javascript packages downloaded surpassed components in the maven java components — ahead of mikeal rogers’ forecast according to sonatype’s  state of the software supply chain  billion npm packages were downloaded in  up  percent from the year before while java component downloads “only” rose  percent the number of downloads is a function of the number of users the total number of available to be downloaded and frequency of software releasesupdates according to the  stack overflow developer survey the percentage of developers using nodejs has risen from  percent in  to  percent in  according to module counts the total number of unique nodejs modules surpassed java in  and now outpaces  million to  million nodejs continues to grow its user base and complexity but the continued increase in downloads per year is also related to the shortening application release cycles looking to the future npm downloads per user per month will be an interesting stat to monitor this week in podcasts the problem with the old school vendors of enterprise backupandrecovery aka “disaster recovery” aka “continuity of operations” is that they got the backup part ok but the recovery process many organizations have found has been very difficult if not outright impossible explained rubrik‘s kenny to as explained to  software engineering daily host jeff meyerson rubrik is focused on that sweet spot of microsoft shops running a vmware infrastructure offering an appliance  to back up virtual machines so they can be quickly restored the restorations happen quickly so even if they don’t provide full performance an organization will have something running into full operations are restored to argued httptrafficlibsyncomsedailyrubrikmp   how much is the kubernetes community truly dependent on google this was the question pondered by the software defined talk crew discussing matt asay’s recent essay on how kubernetes community is dependent on google they all agreed that asay while a smart fellow seems to be misguided here or he was intentionally out to write a hit piece sure google still dominates the ks code development but not as much as it used to “clearly someone

lead generation a fact of business life whether you’re a multinational enterprise a twoperson startup or anything in between sales leads are critical to your success techniques for sales lead generation range from trolling social networking sites to tapping into other kinds of online and offline sources to oldfashioned cold calling of names pulled from phone books performing business lead generation in any of these ways consumes time that reps would rather spend talking to qualified customers and closing deals worse still these manual sales lead generation techniques often yield less than useful results in the form of incorrect phone numbers and partial or outdated data this type of faulty information leads to more wasted effort and expense pursuing “dead dials” and abandoned
