my career leading brave men and women who thrive and win when they are both strong and smart my experience has taught me that education trusted institutions and civil discourse are the lifeblood of a

questions about the shocking end to his career stanley mcchrystal on shaking up the military in a recent visit to the washington post mcchrystal said that he regretted that the situation happened but “any of the things that caused it to happen i really don’t have that feeling about” “my biggest regret was i had brought a bunch of people over who trusted and believed in me to execute a mission and now i was leaving them and you feel like you let them down” he told the post’s on leadership blog “i cared deeply about the mission in afghanistan — and i still do — so when i was separated from it i regretted that” the situation taught him two lessons about dealing with change the first is that after something unexpected happens that “shifts the ground under your feet” you’re going to be required to look inward he said retired gen stanley a mcchrystal is shown here in the washington post newsroom “if who you were was entirely based upon the position you were in or the headlines you got in the newspaper or you had essentially subcontracted out your selfworth to the judgments of others then you’re going to be like tumbleweed” he said “you’re going to be blown” the second lesson “you’re going to find out who your friends are anything that happens in your life is one of those challenges it may not be at the level of celebrity but everybody’s going to travel that road” mcchrystal discussed a variety of other things including his belief that the military should allow “lateral entry” for midcareer individuals the rest of the interview is available here world nationalsecurity checkpoint get

segalmay   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo from left peter thiel charles koch stanley mcchrystal credit from left andrew gomberteuropean pressphoto agency bo raderthe wichita eagle via associated press chris ushercbs news via getty images ignore the scent of selfcongratulation that wafts from nearly every book in the how to succeed category and what remains is largess priced to move the subtext reads something like this “i made it big and if you follow my advice sold here for a fraction of what it cost me you can too” but pure altruism rarely explains much and the ulterior motives behind these works are often as interesting as their catechismsthe veneer of beneficence is somehow easier to see through in audiobook form as evidenced by the works reviewed here of the three “zero to one notes on startups or how to build the future” by the silicon valley investor and paypal cofounder peter thiel spends the least amount of time justifying itself this gives the book the feel of an advertisement for a man who believes he has no need to advertise which is a very savvy approach to selfpromotion ‘zero to one’ “zero to one” distills lectures from a class about startups that thiel taught at stanford in  based on the scribblings of his former student blake masters who is credited with a writing assist and who capably narrates the book the lessons of thiel’s course are too important to be limited to a few lucky undergraduates we are told in the preface “there’s no reason why the future should happen only at stanford or in college or in silicon valley”so what futureshaping advice does thiel have for the next generation of entrepreneurs first competition is expensive risky and it invariably reduces profits so your goal is not to dream up a company in a field that already exists and then fight for market share no the smart move is to found a business in a still unimagined realm — an act of creation that thiel a serial catchphrase coiner calls “going from zero to one” advertisement continue reading the main story once you’ve pioneered a new industry you and your colleagues should set your sights on a very specific goal building a monopoly “whereas a competitive firm must sell at the market price” thiel tells us “a monopoly owns its market so it can set its own prices” thiel’s favorite example is google which all but invented the online ­advertising market and has dominated it for years continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story as advice goes “create the next google” is both unassailable and perfectly useless thiel glancingly acknowledges that the type of startup he is describing is rare but the fortune he made at paypal and later as an investor in facebook has apparently convinced him that the exceptional would be far more common if people were just bolder and more imaginative he makes this and other points in brief chapters packed with references to pythagoras the unabomber tolkien karl marx jim morrison ­nietzsche john rawls and shakespeare in interviews and speeches thiel has displayed a sense of humor that would have been helpful here listening to this fivehour production is like getting stuck at a dinner party beside a guy whose money and surfeit of ideas has convinced him that he should do all the talking ‘good profit’ it takes a while to figure out the real point of “good ­profit how creating value for others built one of the world’s most successful companies” by charles koch the chief executive of koch industries the preface narrated by koch himself — paul michael whose voice you might recall from “the da vinci code” audiobook handles the rest — is a folksy origins story traced to the family patriarch fred koch a “john waynetype” chemical engineer the younger koch now  years old quickly segues into the tale of the astounding growth of the company which currently employs some  people in fields as varied as oil ranching and commodities trading one thousand dollars invested in this privately held behemoth in  koch states would be worth  million todaythe secret marketbased management koch says which turns out to be a perfectly sensible fivepart framework for making decisions about hiring firing and managing a company but that framework was the subject of koch’s  book “the science of success” so what we have here is a rehash and at a running time that exceeds nine hours quite a slog despite michael’s comfortingly authoritative voice the bulk of “good ­profit” is self­evident truths that have been repackaged as wisdom typical is this mouthful from a chapter called “incentives” “every company should strive to leverage incentives to motivate all employees to fully develop and apply their capabilities to maximize longterm value for the company in a principled way”ok did someone suggest otherwisethe liveliest part of “good profit” and arguably its reason for being is a series of homilies in favor of free markets and against corporate welfare and special pleading of any kind profit that is “good” is earned honestly without favors from the government giving a counterexample koch denounces a  french law intended to aid independent bookstores by banning online booksellers from offering free shipping “artificially propping up businesses is bad for consumers” he writes “and ultimately bad for the employees of those businesses since change is inevitable”there is hardly a hint here that koch and his younger brother david are among the most politically active executives in american history together they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars backing candidates who stand against regulations and taxes by the midterm elections of  according to jane mayer’s book “dark money” these efforts yielded astounding results democrats lost control of the house of representatives and republicans gained  seats in state legislatures across the countrygiven that koch industries is among the country’s leading producers of toxic waste and has spent millions settling cases in federal court these guys are not exactly disinterested parties no they don’t lobby politicians they just have them replaced whether you think this strategy leads to “good profit” depends on where you stand politically but koch’s very handson role in american politics is a bizarre omission in a book about the intersection of business and government ‘team of teams’ “team of teams” by retired gen stanley mcchrystal and three coauthors appears to have several goals it works as a calling card for his consulting firm mcchrystal group which brings “lessons from the battlefield to the boardroom” as the company’s website says the book is also a history of one of his great victories the pursuit and eventual killing of abu musab alzarqawi the elusive and sociopathic leader of al qaeda in iraq advertisement continue reading the main story unfortunately mcchrystal the consultant keeps interrupting mcchrystal the general after every twist and complication in the alzarqawi story we pause so that some theoretical concept — usually related to how groups are organized and how mcchrystal tinkered with command structure in iraq — can be illustrated with a historical anecdote thus we get a potted biography of frederick taylor the father of industrial efficiency an account of nasa in its moonshot

mcchrystal turns up to narrate fiveminute summaries at the end of each chapter paul michael once again handles everything else no doubt these are meant as refreshers but they make you wonder if this hybrid of management course and combat memoir really needs to be  hours long that’s especially true when mcchrystal describes his great “aha” moment in the battle against al qaeda in iraq “we realized that our goal was not the creation of one massive team we needed to create a team of teams” he means an organization in which groups from different fiefs like the cia and the army special forces work together rather than in competitive silosthat’s the big reveal which is heartbreaking because right after september  it was obvious that the intelligence agencies hadn’t been communicating mcchrystal addresses this failure in a section called “sharing” but he doesn’t explain how lessons of that calamity could have been forgotten a few years later let alone stand as the ­titleworthy insight of this

soldiers were free when speaking to him the statements attributed to mcchrystal and members of his staff drew the attention of the white house when mcchrystal called biden to apologize mcchrystal
