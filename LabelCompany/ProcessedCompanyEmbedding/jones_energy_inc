inception jones energy has been a steward and steadfast partner in the communities where we reside and work we are interested in making a difference not only at the corporate level but by supporting the generous nature and initiatives of our employees view the gallery frequently asked questions with such a long history as a private company why did jones energy go public the reason for going public in  was simple – the opportunity set for jones had become too large to fund as a private company jonny jones our founder chairman and ceo started jones energy in  with an investment of  million jones had been a private company for over  years before going public in july  at  per share raising approximately  million just four months after going public jones announced one of the bigger acquisitions in its history purchasing sabine’s anadarko assets for approximately  million we continue to see our opportunity for growth as vast and look forward to continuing our long tradition of operational excellence as a public company why does your market capitalization vary greatly depending upon what site i look at to properly calculate our market capitalization one must include both the class a and class b shares outstanding some sites understate our market capitalization by only including the class a shares what brought jones energy to the midcontinent region our founder jonny jones chose the midcontinent region back in  because it was a great place to be in the oil and gas business which still holds true today the midcontinent region has long been a hospitable home to oil and gas companies with an impressive nearly centurylong history of drilling activity across multiple formations this means that the region has significant midstream infrastructure and extensive well control  two factors that are extremely important to an upstream energy company why have you stayed focused in the midcontinent area this has been our home since the company’s inception and we have extensive experience that covers nearly  different formations additionally the midcontinent continues to be an area of vast opportunity for jones energy just the cleveland play alone covers over  million acres the stacked pay potential of the midcontinent also provides significant development opportunities as jones energy is just beginning to tap the potential of other formations in the area are you willing to look at opportunities outside of the midcontinent we are constantly evaluating growth opportunities and do not limit ourselves to the midcontinent region that said we see tremendous opportunity in the midcontinent a key to our ability to maintain our growth and create value stems from scale in our core plays we seek opportunities where we can have a meaningful presence and this would apply to any potential new plays outside of our current focus areas most importantly no matter where we grow we will make sure that our growth is purposeful and deliberate – grounded in our strategy to only operate where we can be best in class what is your hedging strategy we actively hedge our oil gas and natural gas liquids production to minimize commodity price risk we believe that if the economics are good enough to drill the well then it is wise to lock in those economics and protect cash flow for future drilling investment and debt repayment we primarily utilize swaps to hedge our production in the nearterm  months we generally seek to maintain hedges for  of production from proved developing producing reserves and a reasonable amount of hedges for expected production from proved undeveloped reserves beyond  months we generally seek to maintain hedges for  of our proved developed producing reserves assuming adequate liquidity is available in the market we think this strategy provides the company with maximum operational optionality and positions us to take advantage of opportunities regardless of the direction commodity prices move ×close navigating away
