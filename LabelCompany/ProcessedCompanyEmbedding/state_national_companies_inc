mispricedapr  about state national snc sebastian grimberg special situations value summarystate national companies is a specialty provider of pc insurance operating in two niche markets across the usunlike most pc insurers state nationals unique business model and sustainable competitive advantages translate into consistent and relatively high returns on equity with low financial leverageonetimers are hiding the companys earning power allowing prospective investors to acquire the company at a truly cheap priceduring the course of this year the stock should start screening well and institutional investors will discover the namemanagement has the financial flexibility to buy back stock without altering the companys investments in future growthstate national companies nasdaqsnc is neither a broken story nor a turnaround quite the contrary it is a profitable growing enterprise whose share price is temporally disconnected from its business reality the companys improving fundamentals are grounded in its solid foundation the ledbetter family and the companys employees have done an outstanding job in building a great business in a highly competitive industry they discovered a market niche opportunistically expanded it and repeated the process if management preserves this disciplined approach going forward state national offers a significant asymmetric riskreward profile at the current market price with probability of permanent capital loss close to  and at least a  return from current prices pc insurance  insurance companies primarily make money by charging premiums to policyholders for insurance coverage of risks facing the policyholder since the idea to be paid for holding other peoples money is quite enticing the industry attracts intense competition furthermore most insureds dont care from whom they buy making insurance a commoditylike product pc insurance companies specialize in specific lines of businesses auto homeowners and workers compensation are a few of the more commonly known lines of business but in most cases thats not enough to overcome unfavorable industry dynamics as a result a typical insurance company underwrites at a loss makes profits investing its float money the company does not own but temporally holds and generates economic value if its cost of float is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds as well see below state national is an atypical insurance company in the sense that the company creates economic value in a different way what does snc do founded in  by brothers lonnie ledbetter and terry ledbetter state national companies is a specialty provider of pc insurance operating in two niche markets across the us program services and collateral protection insurance cpi in the program services segment snc leverages its am best a excellent rating licenses and reputation to provide access to the us property and casualty insurance market the company offers issuing carrier capacity to general agents or producers in exchange for a ceding fee and reinsures all the underwriting and operating risk associated with these arrangements in the lender services segment snc specializes in providing collateral protection insurance which insures personal automobiles and other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions banks and specialty finance lenders in other words when a borrower does not uphold its obligation to insure the collateral underlying the loan the lender can pay the company for cpi and then add the cost of cpi to the borrowers loan a more detailed review of each business is presented below program services business the program services business is the biggest contributor to earnings  of  adjusted pretax income and what mainly sets apart the company from a typical insurer the company provides issuing carrier capacity in exchange for a fee around  of gross written premium and reinsures substantially all of the underwriting and business risk as you can see in the following picture in this segment snc looks like an insurance broker business is originated from general agents ga or capacity providers cp in the case of gas they seek to provide customized insurance solutions that require an am best arated carrier snc retains an am best a rating since  in the case of cps some of the reasons include insurers that have access to origination but require an am best a rating or broader licensing sncs subsidiaries are admitted carriers licensed to write property and casualty business in all  states and the district of columbia foreign insurers writing in the us domestic insurers seeking additional business free of channel conflicts insurers looking to reduce financial leverage institutional risk investors including hedge funds and other investment funds among others contracts are designed in a manner that a gas and cps are obliged to deal with each other with gas providing policy administration claims handling cash handling underwriting or other traditional insurance company services and cps monitoring the gas the funds for premiums commissions losses assessments and other payments are settled directly between each party snc does not record any receivables or payables b all the underwriting and business risk is borne by the reinsurer if a ga defaults on its obligation to pay ceding fees to snc the cp is obliged to make the payment therefore the only risk retained by snc is the credit risk of the cp which the company mitigates by establishing strict financial criteria to select cps or by requiring cps to post substantial collateral the company holds  billion of collateral against b of gross recoverables as of december   as a result of a and b this segment has strong operating leverage and very few risks snc has ceded over  billion in premiums over the past  years with no unpaid reinsurance recoverables additionally the lowcost business model allows snc to charge fees that are in the lower end of the market range which is an additional attraction for gas and cps to work with the company to put it simply the business is a cash flow machine some companies including amtrust financial services nasdaqafsi and argo group nasdaqagii offer issuing carrier capacity but on a limited basis and unlike snc assume a portion of the underwriting risk lender services business in the lender services segment the company primarily offers collateral protection insurance as is stated in the companys prospectus the key difference between cpi and traditional automobile physical damage coverage is that cpi is purchased by lenders to protect their interest in collateral when it has been established that a borrower has not fulfilled his or her obligation to the lending institution to purchase adequate insurance coverage if a borrower then purchases adequate insurance coverage the lender cancels cpi coverage the following diagram explains the business so far state national has been focused on the credit union space where the company spots a leading market share of approx  this was mainly achieved through an agreement with cuna mutual cuna mutual is an insurer that has relationships with  of the nations credit unions the joint venture allows snc to leverage on these relationships and cuna mutuals substantial sales force approx  people in turn cuna mutual outsources cpi administration claims handling and other aspects of the business to snc which is the only pureplay vertical integrated cpi provider a key component of this segments value proposition is insurtrak a proprietary insurance tracking system the platform delivers realtime visibility into the current borrower insurance information and management believes it is highly scalable with little incremental cost dont bother to find this asset on the companys balance sheet the companys expertise in the space its strategic alliance with cuna mutual and the strong value proposition in the form of insurtrak translate into an average combined ratio of  during the last three years what is also encouraging about this segment is its growth potential for the year end   of earned premium derived from banks and specialty lenders and management believes this market is bigger than the credit union space if for the sake of simplicity we assume that the market size is the same and that the company will be able to achieve a  market share through a cuna mutual type joint venture this segment has the potential to double from current levels with little incremental costs snc has hired additional dedicated sales staff to address this market adding the two together when you add the two operating segments together the result is a company with the following attributes profitability across market cycles the company has a year track record of profitability since the company retains no underwriting risk in the program services business and cpi is a lowlimit shorttail business time between the event and the settlement the overall business is quite predictable which allows snc to operate at a relatively high premiumsurplus leverage midteens adj roe with low financial leverage it is worth noting that in  the company achieved a  roe with a  increase in equity relative to  due to the private placement in its last k it is stated that the companys objective is to maintain a financial leverage ratio in the range of  to  page  as you can see in the following table if we take the middle range of that guidance which is in line with s equity the company would have achieved a  roe in  valuation if we think that for the above reasons snc will continue to operate profitably in the future the companys net cash and investments should be valueadded prospective investors would also be willing to pay a multiple for the companys adj net income which in this case is a proxy for free cash flow note sncs market cap is based on  million shares outstanding as of april   and a  share price  adj net income is estimated based on managements projections for ceding fees earned premiums and combined ratios for yearend  taking the most conservative projections in each case a  multiple for an overcapitalized midteens roe insurance brokertype business that has been profitable during the past  years seems low it also worth noting that adj net income has grown at a  cagr during the past three years but even if the multiple doesnt expand and the business doesnt grow much going forward prospective investors still get a  return at current market prices moreover in case the mispricing persists management has the financial flexibility to create shareholder value by selling a small portion of the companys investment portfolio currently yielding  and buying back common stock why the opportunity exists market participants are completely ignoring this company in its first conference call as a public company there were no questions and in the second call only bob ramsey from fbr capital asked some questions who is the only analyst covering the company at least publicly a probable reason why this company is being ignored is because onetimers are hiding the companys earnings power in the above table net income is adjusted as if snc had been a c corporation publicly traded company since   net income was particularly impacted by special items with the line contract modification expense deserving a special mention initially snc had a reinsurance agreement with cuna mutual where the company ceded  of the alliance business to cuna mutual additionally cuna mutual reimbursed  of direct commissions paid to the accounts subject to the alliance agreement in  snc paid m to cuna mutual to increase its retention of the business from  to  and reduce reimbursement from  to  those m are the m you see in the above table net of tax benefits in short this was an investment that the company managed to expense these are the kind of things that distinguish managers with an owner mentality from managers that strive to maximize shortterm eps by the end of this year when the gap between real and accounting earnings will have probably narrowed whoever runs a pb   roe   screen should find the company at the current share price possible share overhang from potential update of meadowbrooks am best rating the merger between meadowbrook insurance group nysemig and fosun international limited otcpkfosuf is expected to close in the second half of  meadowbrook accounted for  of total revenues in  if the company merges with fosun and subsequently receives a better rating from am best revenues from this customer could be impaired still this is normal business for snc while some cps are upgraded others are downgraded and the potential outcome is contemplated in managements guidance risks we should distinguish between business risks and risks specific to minority shareholders overall the business will be fine snc has never lost its am best a rating since it was first granted in  and probably has never been as capitalized as it is today its revenues are geographically diversified which mitigates a negative regulatory outcome in a given state the company has a good and mutually beneficial relationship with cuna mutual which was recently amended in short prospective investors will have a hard time trying to kill this company maybe the biggest risk facing minority shareholders is that the company is a family business it was founded by two brothers the ledbetter family owns  of total shares outstanding as of april   and  out of  senior managers are from the same family as an outsider with no connections to the family or the companys insiders and considering its very short history as a public company it is hard to assure that management will treat all shareholders equally still common sense tells us that to build a successful enterprise you have to be honest with all your stakeholders in the rare occasion that this case turns out being an exception it is worth mentioning that fortress investment group nysefig owns  of total shares outstanding and has a representative on the board it is my impression that you dont get to actively manage b by looking aside when someone is milking you and we would be truly unlucky if common sense fails us twice remarks snc has a fortress balance sheet strong free cash flow generation sustainable competitive advantages  years of profitability and an equally promising future once investors start discovering this gem and understand its unique business model the opportunity to buy the companys shares at bargain prices will be probably gone disclosure the author is long snc the author wrote this article themselves and it expresses their own opinions

item  business   overview   we are a leading specialty provider of property and casualty insurance operating in two niche markets across the united states  in our program services segment we leverage our “a” excellent am best rating expansive licenses and reputation to provide access to the us property and casualty insurance market in exchange for ceding fees  in our lender services segment we specialize in providing collateral protection insurance “cpi” which insures personal automobiles and other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions banks and specialty finance companies both of these businesses have a long track record of profitable operations   our program services segment generates significant fee income in the form of ceding fees by offering issuing carrier capacity to both specialty general agents and other producers “gas” who sell control and administer books of insurance business that are supported by third parties that assume reinsurance risk  these reinsurers are domestic and foreign insurers and institutional risk investors “capacity providers” that want to access specific lines of us property and casualty insurance business  issuing carrier “fronting” arrangements refer to our business in which we write insurance on behalf of a capacity provider and then reinsure the risk under these policies with the capacity provider in exchange for ceding fees our broad licensing authority strong am best “a” excellent rating which is the third    table of contents highest out of fifteen rating categories used by am best and track record of over  consecutive years of profitable operations allow us to act as the policyissuing carrier for business produced by gas   we reinsure substantially all of the underwriting and operating risks in connection with our fronting arrangements to our capacity providers  in many cases we hold significant collateral to secure the associated reinsurance recoverables we have ceded over  billion in premiums over the past  years with no unpaid reinsurance recoverables  because we generally only write in these lines on a fronting basis gas and reinsurers can be confident that we will not compete with them with respect to the business they write through us in exchange for providing our insurance capacity licensing and rating to our ga and capacity provider clients we receive ceding fees averaging in excess of  of gross written premiums  in addition we require minimum annual fees which we refer to as “capacity fees” for smaller programs programs with uncertain premium volume or a program that involves exclusivity    our lender services segment generates premium primarily from providing cpi to our credit union bank and specialty finance clients  lenders purchase cpi to provide coverage for automobiles or other vehicles of borrowers who do not uphold their obligation to insure the collateral underlying the loan our lender clients pay us directly for cpi and then add the cost of cpi to the borrower’s loan our cpi business is fully vertically integrated we manage all aspects of the cpi business cycle including sales and marketing policy issuance policy administration underwriting and claims handling  we believe that we are the only vertically integrated cpi provider focused primarily on this product offering and that the breadth and flexibility of our services enable us to provide our lender clients with responsive and customized policy terms services and reporting to better serve their needs  we service our cpi clients through insurtrak our proprietary technology platform that allows both us and our clients to track and manage a cpi program we believe our insurtrak system is highly scalable with the capacity to service a much larger volume of business without significant changes to the system as of december   we had over  cpi clients with portfolios totaling  million cpi loans in addition our integrated cpi platform and insurtrak have contributed to our ability to write business for credit unions banks and specialty finance companies   we have an exclusive relationship with cuna mutual insurance society “cuna mutual” to provide cpi to credit unions  cuna mutual is a leading insurance company focused on providing a range of insurance products to credit unions in the us this alliance has enabled us to achieve a leading market share in the credit union cpi market in  we amended our relationship with cuna mutual to increase our retention of the business subject to the alliance to  from  for policies written on or after july     we write our insurance business through our insurance company subsidiaries which have expansive licenses to write insurance in the us  state national insurance company inc “snic” and national specialty insurance company “nsic” are admitted carriers licensed to write property and casualty business in all  states and the district of columbia  city national insurance company “cnic” is an admitted carrier licensed to write property and casualty business in  states and the district of columbia  united specialty insurance company “usic” is an admitted carrier in delaware and is

nonadmitted shell company  the company was subsequently renamed independent specialty insurance company “isic”  snic nsic and usic operate under an intercompany pooling arrangement in order to take advantage of our strong “a” excellent group rating from am best  we have received regulatory approval to add cnic and isic to the intercompany pooling arrangement in    our long history of profitable operations has enabled us to maintain our “a” excellent am best rating while writing gross premiums in excess of  billion in  on approximately  million of shareholders’ equity or over four times

program services — our program services segment is a fronting business we leverage our “a” excellent am best rating expansive licenses and reputation to provide access to the us property and    table of contents casualty insurance market to capacity providers in exchange for ceding fees through our fronting business we write a wide variety of insurance products principally including general liability insurance commercial liability insurance commercial multiperil insurance property insurance and workers compensation insurance  we are able to reinsure substantially all of the underwriting and operating risks associated with our fronting arrangements to our capacity providers we mitigate the credit risk of our capacity providers generally by either selecting well capitalized highly rated authorized reinsurers or requiring that the reinsurer post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks   · lender services — our lender services segment specializes in providing cpi which insures personal automobiles and other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions banks and specialty finance companies  our lender clients pay us directly for cpi and then add the cost of cpi to the loans of borrowers who do not uphold their obligation to the lender to insure the collateral underlying the loan we also provide ancillary insurance products that currently are not actively marketed   our history   the ledbetter family founded a small general agency in  selling cpi exclusively in texas by the late s the company began to expand the cpi business beyond texas  also at that time we began to receive inquiries from other carriers and gas seeking to access the texas nonstandard automobile market and recognized the opportunity to act as an issuing carrier  the volume of this fronting business grew significantly  most of this business was nonstandard automobile insurance in the state of texas written by a county mutual insurance company that we managed and all of this business was  reinsured no am best rating was required and the business could be written at very high leverage ratios  this high degree of leverage the related reinsurer credit underwriting undertaken to support that leverage and the significant collateral held against potential losses were the foundation of our program services business model   in  we formed snic to write our cpi business directly snic received an “a” excellent rating from am best in  and has maintained the rating for over  years  over the years we expanded our fronting and cpi operations outside of texas and acquired additional insurance subsidiaries   in  we formed an exclusive relationship with cuna mutual a leading provider of insurance products to credit unions this alliance has enabled us to achieve a leading market share in the credit union cpi market   on june   we completed the sale of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in a private placement exempt from registration under the securities act of  which we refer to in this report as the private placement subsequently we registered the resale of these shares with the securities and exchange commission and our common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on november     program services segment   business overview   in our program services segment we leverage our “a” excellent am best rating expansive licenses and reputation to provide access to the us property and casualty insurance market in exchange for ceding fees this access is sought by gas and capacity providers in the us property and casualty insurance market the most common underlying business reasons are set out below   · gas writing specialized books of business supported by capacity providers and   · capacity providers seeking a fronting arrangement including   o insurers that have access to origination but require broader licensing or given their lower rating the use of an “a” am best rating to access business      table of contents o foreign insurers writing in the united states either directly or through gas   o domestic insurers seeking additional business free of channel conflicts   o insurers looking to reduce financial leverage and   o institutional risk investors that need to write through licensed highly rated entities   many of our fronting programs are arranged with the assistance of brokers that are seeking to provide customized insurance solutions for specialty insurance business that requires an am best “a” rated carrier in exchange for access to our rating licensing and reputation we generally charge ceding fees ranging between  and  of gross written premium  we are able to do this profitably because our specialized fronting business model relies on our gas or capacity providers to provide the infrastructure associated with providing policy administration claims handling cash handling underwriting or other traditional insurance company services our low expense structure enables the program services segment to produce significant additional premium volume with only minimal incremental expense increase   using our model we are able to generate significant gross written premiums on a relatively small capital base compared to other insurance carriers   we reinsure substantially all of the underwriting risk and business risk to the capacity providers and collect ceding fees on the transactions we facilitate we remain exposed to the credit risk of capacity providers or the risk that one of our capacity providers becomes insolvent or otherwise unable or unwilling to pay policyholder claims to mitigate this credit risk of capacity providers we have established financial criteria for selecting capacity providers as well as comprehensive methodologies and systems to monitor and mitigate this risk see “—relationships with capacity providers and producers” below    relationships with capacity providers and producers   the primary capacity providers that partner with us either make the strategic decision not to write certain business directly or cannot write directly  we offer a fully licensed platform with a strong capital position and strong relationships with regulators and rating agencies that have been cultivated for over three decades  our low cost business model allows us to charge ceding fees that we believe are on the lower end of the market range which is an additional attraction for capacity providers to work with us we typically enter into these arrangements with respect to specified portions of a capacity provider’s business rather than all of their portfolio   in connection with writing program services business we enter into agency and reinsurance agreements with both the producer typically gas and the capacity provider reinsurer whereby the producer and capacity provider are generally required to deal directly with each other to develop business structures and terms and to implement and maintain the ongoing contractual relationship  in a number of cases the producer and capacity provider for a program are part of the same organization or are otherwise affiliated the producer generally is the party that will handle the marketing and underwriting of the policies subject to certain limitations the overall administration of the business including preparing reports and making payments ie premiums commissions losses loss adjustment expenses assessments etc required pursuant to the applicable agreements and handling of claims up to certain limits and in some cases in conjunction with the reinsurer the reinsurer typically undertakes to monitor the producer and to be responsible for the performance of the producer  as a result of our contract design substantially all of the underwriting risk and business risk inherent in the arrangement is borne by the reinsurer  we take the risk of insolvency or other failure to pay by a capacity provider and also have potential liability for a breach of our obligations on limited matters such as a fraudulent or criminal act on our part fines or penalties assessed for our willful misconduct a failure to defend an action or prosecute an appeal or our bad faith or negligent rejection of a settlement within policy limits   to the extent the funds for premiums commissions losses assessments and other payments are not the obligation of the company and are settled directly between the producer and reinsurer we do not record any receivables or payables  this direct settlement of balances due between the parties has several benefits to us including reduced leverage ratios increased best’s capital adequacy ratio “bcar” score used by am best to monitor capital adequacy and reduced staffing requirements    table of contents   as compensation for writing this business we receive ceding fees generally from the gas or other producers  if a producer defaults on its obligation to pay these fees or any other amount due the capacity provider is generally obligated to make the payment under the guarantee contained in the contracts  we charge ceding fees averaging in excess of  of gross written premium  the fee may be adjusted upward if for example the business uses more surplus ie has a longer tail or requires more administration or oversight due to collateral requirements  in addition we require minimum annual fees which we refer to as “capacity fees” for smaller programs programs with uncertain premium volume or a program that involves exclusivity   we select gas based on their experience capacity to provide the necessary services reputation and financial stability we regularly monitor the performance of our gas to ensure that there is no material deterioration with respect to such factors over time   we generally require new capacity providers to either have an am best rating of “a” excellent or better have equity andor capital and surplus of at least  million and not have other issues that impact credit quality negatively or post substantial collateral  if a capacity provider does not meet our selection criteria we utilize a number of risk mitigating levers including requiring the posting of collateral and excess collateral equity andor capital and surplus and financial covenants guarantees by affiliates and premium andor policy limit caps  we review historical financial results of proposed capacity providers to assess financial stability   our contracts relating to collateral typically provide for changes in the level of collateral required based on estimates of reinsurance recoverables our contracts may also provide for changes in level of collateral required based on certain events such as changes in a capacity provider’s ratings and level of equity andor capital and surplus see “—reinsurance”   products   in our program services segment we act as an issuing carrier for foreign and domestic insurance and reinsurance companies in exchange for ceding fees writing a wide variety of insurance products principally including general liability insurance commercial liability insurance commercial multiperil insurance property insurance and workers compensation insurance   sales and marketing   we source our fronting arrangements from reinsurance brokers and directly with gas and capacity providers historically we have been able to fully leverage our capital base through our traditional distribution channels with only a modest sales and marketing effort and using our existing infrastructure we historically have been opportunistic and relationshipdriven rather than systematic with respect to new business generation but recently began actively marketing our services we continue to build direct relationships with gas and capacity providers and have hired additional fullydedicated sales staff  also we are now attending international conferences in addition to meetings by our senior executives with capacity providers in london and bermuda these meetings and conferences along with the direct marketing campaign with gas have produced new business and viable leads   we do not expect that developing direct relationships will have a negative effect on existing large brokerage relationships in our experience brokers typically view fronting deals as opportunistic rather than core to their business and generally accept that companies that primarily act as issuing carriers will and must develop direct relationships we have a number of longterm relationships with gas brokers and reinsurers turnover generally occurs when capacity providers choose not to use a fronting arrangement loss performance deteriorates a ga forms its own insurance company or a capacity provider exits a particular line of business  we have historically been able to more than offset cancelled programs with a combination of new fronting arrangements and organic growth in existing fronting arrangements      table of contents competition   we believe there are relatively few active competitors in the fronting business  we compete primarily on the basis of price customer service geographic coverage financial strength ratings licenses reputation business model experience and generally not offering state national’s products for our own account  our principal competitors are companies such as james river group holdings ltd clear blue financial holdings llc spinnaker insurance company amtrust financial services inc and argo group which we believe only act as an issuing carrier on a limited basis or if a ga chooses to use an alternative structure in which the insurer retains the risk as opposed to that involves an issuing carrier  unlike us some of our competitors offer policy administration and are willing to assume a significant portion of the underwriting risk  we believe our long track record of success in this market and longstanding relationship and credibility with am best enable us to maintain our “a” excellent am best rating with a relatively high operating leverage that we expect would be difficult for a competitor to obtain   geographic distribution   we write our insurance business through our insurance company subsidiaries  the following table sets forth the distribution of our program services gross premium written by state as a percent of total gross premium written for the years ended december    and                                        program gross premium written   years ended       december     in thousands                     california                               texas

                      other jurisdictions                            total                           lender services segment   business overview   in our lender services segment we primarily offer cpi which insures automobiles or other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions banks and specialty finance companies cpi is added by lenders to the loans of borrowers who do not uphold their obligation to the lender to insure the collateral underlying the loan the product is underwritten directly by us we also provide ancillary insurance products that we do not actively market for the year ended december   approximately  of our cpi business was written with credit unions  in our cpi business for  the average lender loan balance was approximately  and our average claim was approximately  as of december   we had over  cpi clients and with portfolios totaling  million cpi loans   relationship with cuna mutual   we entered into a collateral protection alliance agreement with cuna mutual in  which we refer to as the alliance agreement which provided us access to a wider array of credit union clients and added significant additional scale to our cpi business  this alliance has enabled us to achieve a leading market share in the credit union cpi market  pursuant to the alliance with cuna mutual cuna mutual outsourced cpi administration and claims handling to us   in connection with the alliance agreement the parties also entered into a reinsurance agreement pursuant to which we initially agreed to cede  of the alliance business to cuna mutual however in  we amended the alliance agreement to increase our retention of the business subject to the alliance to  from  for business written on or    table of contents after july   and in exchange we made payments to cuna mutual totaling  million  in addition cuna mutual pays a ceding commission of  and reimburses a proportional share of direct commissions and other reimbursable expenses paid to accounts the policies subject to the reinsurance agreement with cuna mutual insure automobiles or other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions across the us  for a description of the coverages under these policies see “—cpi product” below   vertical integration   our cpi business is fully integrated in that our operations in this segment cover sales policy issuance policy administration underwriting claims handling and all other aspects of the cpi business cycle we believe we are the only vertically integrated cpi provider focused primarily on this product offering because we control all aspects of the cpi business operations we can readily customize our product coverage and reporting to each client we underwrite each of our lender client accounts and have the ability to move quickly to reprice the business in response to market or financial changes   cpi product   coverages  a basic cpi policy provides coverage for physical damage to an insured’s automobile or other vehicles the key difference between cpi and traditional automobile physical damage coverage is that cpi is purchased by lenders to protect their interest in collateral when it has been established that a borrower has not fulfilled his or her obligation to the lending institution to purchase adequate insurance coverage by contrast traditional automobile coverage is secured by individuals to protect their interests in the automobile in addition to their lienholder’s interest if applicable   cpi coverage can be written to protect the interest of the lending institution in the automobile which is known as single interest coverage or it can be written to protect the interest of both the lender and the borrower which is known as dual interest coverage at the lender’s request a cpi program may also include a variety of additional coverage options supplementing the basic physical damage protection although the lender is generally responsible for paying our premiums some of the coverage we offer provides for reimbursement of premiums the lender paid to us in the event of a borrower default the most significant coverage options include   · collision  covers accidental loss or damage to the collateral caused by collision with another object or rollover   · premium deficiency  provides for reimbursement of earned premiums subject to a wide range of options such as physical damage status and loss ratio   · conversionskip loss  provides coverage for the loss due to concealment disposal or misappropriation of the collateral by the borrower   allowance for policy cancellations   we experience a high level of policy cancellations with our cpi product because borrowers often purchase insurance at the traditional rates that provides protection for them in addition to their lender  as such our recorded cpi premiums written are those that we expect to earn and we record an allowance for policy cancellations for the estimated amount of return premiums and policy fees net of commission expense and premium taxes associated with expected future policy cancellations  see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation—critical accounting estimates—allowance for policy cancellations” in item  of this report   ancillary products   as part of our agreement with cuna mutual we no longer market any noncpi products to credit unions which include for example guaranteed auto protection “gap” insurance covers the difference between the value of the collateral and the outstanding loan balance and mortgage protection insurance  for all noncpi products except for gap we act as an agent rather than an underwriter      table of contents sales and marketing   because of our exclusive relationship with cuna mutual we have focused our cpi sales efforts primarily on credit unions we have also sold cpi programs opportunistically to banks and specialty lending institutions as of december   we had over  cpi clients nationwide and focus on developing new relationships on an ongoing basis measured by premium volume as of december   approximately  of our cpi clients have been with us for two or more years and approximately  have been with us for five or more years   cpi is sold by fulltime sales professionals whose territories are organized geographically in order to facilitate extensive facetoface interactions and to develop and leverage regional expertise sales managers are paid bonuses monthly based on sales volume these bonuses are uncapped and may exceed annual salary most sales managers we hire have prior experience selling to financial institutions in addition our alliance with cuna mutual provides us with access to their sales force  that sales force is valuable in part because cuna mutual has business relationships with most credit unions nationwide  the alliance agreement with cuna mutual requires cuna mutual to assist in the sale of new cpi loans and cuna mutual provides incentives to their sales force to achieve sales goals   client servicing   we believe that our vertical integration is a key differentiator for us relative to competitors we act as the agency program administrator and underwriter for our clients some of the key functions offered include new client assistance tracking borrower notification contact center performance and claims  we believe that other cpi market participants that contract out certain functions of the business are not as well positioned to adapt to market and product changes or offer customized solutions   proprietary technology — insurtrak  a key component of our product and service offering is insurtrak our proprietary insurance tracking system insurtrak delivers realtime visibility into the current borrower insurance information a key feature of insurtrak is that it is highly customizable for the client at virtually no incremental cost to us clients have their own ways of managing their businesses and therefore require different analyses data and reporting outputs the platform allows clients and us to view transaction histories monitor calls submit insurance updates and claims and view reports   service operations center  another key component of our service offering is our service operations center the service operations center handles calls from borrowers and is available  hours a day  days a week during regular business hours borrowers can speak with a representative while after hours callers receive answers to routine insurance questions using an interactive voice response system  borrowers can also submit insurance information online through the mail to a dedicated po box or via a dedicated fax line   additionally we take measures to assist borrowers in becoming compliant with insurance requirements of their loans we send at least two customized borrower notices and each month make thousands of outbound insurance verifications in order to avoid unnecessary cpi placements   once a policy has been issued if a loss event occurs we offer an easy electronic claim submission process to clients clients can file electronic claims for single or multiple losses through insurtrak and can track the status appraisers’ reports and final settlement sheets of all claims remotely using this system   competition   the cpi market is very competitive  however we believe the cpi market is mature and has significant barriers to entry such as the required investment in technology and industryspecific knowledge we compete primarily on the basis of price coverages offered claims handling customer service geographic coverage financial strength ratings licenses reputation technology relationships with business partners and experience we compete in the credit union market chiefly with two other cpi providers allied solutions “allied” and southwest business corporation “swbc” allied is a carmel indianabased independent agency selling over  commercial and consumer insurance products with a similar market share to us allied has grown principally through acquisitions since its founding in     table of contents and was sold to securian the parent corporation of minnesota life insurance company in  swbc is a san antonio texasbased ga selling a wide range of insurance mortgage and investment products to commercial and consumer clients together with these two companies we served approximately  of the total credit union cpi market in  with the remainder being assorted smaller players and businesses which have opted to selfinsure   while we sell cpi almost exclusively our two main competitors in the credit union market allied and swbc sell a much wider range of products many of which are offered by cuna mutual we believe that our monoline focus vertical integration and proprietary technology platform provide for faster underwriting and better servicing of cpi clients and continue to serve as a key differentiator in the eyes of our clients   we believe that a strengthening economy an aging automobile fleet and easier access to credit have contributed to recent increases in vehicle sales  in addition the size of lenders’ automobile loan portfolios has been growing reflecting the lenders’ willingness to lend and their willingness to lend at a higher loantovalue ratio we believe that there is opportunity for us to benefit from future growth in the cpi market both organically and through new account sales   geographic distribution   the following table sets forth the distribution of our lender services gross

                   reinsurance   we use quota share reinsurance in both program services and lender services segments “quota share reinsurance” refers to reinsurance under which the insurer transfers or cedes a fixed percentage of liabilities premium and related losses for each policy covered on a pro rata basis in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant agreement  in our lender services business we use quota share reinsurance only in connection with our alliance with cuna mutual   in our program services business we have developed standardized forms of agreements including our quota share reinsurance agreement which we use in substantially all of our fronting arrangements  under our fronting arrangements we generally enter into a  quota share reinsurance agreement whereby we cede to the reinsurer substantially all of our gross liability under all policies issued by and on behalf of us by the general agent  the reinsurer is generally entitled to  of the net premiums received on policies reinsured less the ceding fee to us the commission paid to the general agent and premium taxes on the policies  the reinsurer assumes and is liable for substantially all losses incurred in connection with the risks under the reinsurance agreement including judgments and settlements  see “risk factors—risks relating to our program services segment— some of our fronting arrangements contain limits on the reinsurer’s obligations to us” in item a of this report      table of contents our capacity providers generally pay incurred losses directly and we do not need to access the collateral  the collateral is usually held by a bank trustee and is available to be accessed by us to pay the losses incurred in the unusual case in which a capacity provider does not pay such losses   as of december   we held  billion in collateral securing  billion in reinsurance recoverables collateral held to support reinsurance recoverables generally consists of securities with a

financial strength rating is an independent opinion of a company’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy obligations according to am best an “a” rating which is the third

losses our reserves for losses and lae represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported losses and lae incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances   for the years ended december   and  our loss reserves net of reinsurance recoverables were  million and  million respectively  since almost all of program services losses are ceded our net loss reserves are primarily related to lender services business  there were no significant changes in the key assumptions utilized in the analysis and calculations of our loss reserves during the years ended december   and    the process of establishing the liability for unpaid losses and lae is complex and imprecise as it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events as a result informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an important component of our loss reserving process   loss reserves include statistical reserves and case estimates for individual claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as economic legal and social conditions loss reserves are not discounted to present value which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income      table of contents incurred but not reported “ibnr” reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserve estimates the ibnr reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported some of which are not yet known to the insurer as well as a provision for future development on reported claims   we regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of actuarial methods and available information we update the reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops additional claims are reported and settled or as new information becomes available any changes in estimates are reflected in financial results in the period in which the estimates are changed   our loss reserves are reviewed quarterly by internal actuaries and at least annually by our external actuaries the actuarial review may include an actual to expected loss analysis or more detailed reserve indications for segments with changes as well as the internal actuarial department’s reasonable reserve range compared to carried reserves we review available actuarial indications and review carried reserves compared to the reasonable reserve range to determine whether any reserve adjustments are warranted   with respect to reserve calculation for our program services business we maintain reserve calculation control for all of our programs  where a ga or reinsurer has loss development data available an internal actuary will review such data for sufficiency ie how much history is provided consistency and whether the product for which history is provided is consistent with our product  if the data is not credible or where no data is available the loss reserves are calculated using our experience or industry experience for similar products or lines of business   the majority of our net loss reserves carried relates to our cpi business  this business is shorttailed due to the nature of the coverages provided which means that length of time between the assumption of a risk and the payment of claims in respect of that risk is a relatively short period   there is no one specific industry standard for determining reasonable reserve ranges  the internal actuarial reserve ranges are established by considering projections using variations in the underlying actuarial assumptions projections based on different weightings of the individual actuarial methods projections by statistical variability analysis or by other appropriate reserve considerations   our internal actuarial analysis of the historical data provides the factors we use in our actuarial analysis in estimating our loss and lae reserves these factors are implicit measures over time of claims reported average case incurred amounts case development severity and payment patterns however these factors cannot be directly used as they do not take into consideration changes in business mix claims management regulatory issues medical trends and other subjective factors  we generally use a combination of actuarial factors and subjective assumptions in the development of up to five of the following actuarial methodologies   · paid development method — uses historical cumulative paid losses by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years   · paid bornhuetterferguson “bf” method — a combination of the paid development method and the expected loss method the paid bf method estimates ultimate losses by adding actual paid losses and projected future unpaid losses the amounts produced are then added to cumulative paid losses to produce the final estimates of ultimate incurred losses   · incurred development method — uses historical cumulative incurred losses by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years   · incurred bornhuetterferguson “bf” method — a combination of the incurred development method and the expected loss method the incurred bf method estimates ultimate losses by adding actual incurred losses and    table of contents projected future unreported losses the amounts produced are then added to cumulative incurred losses to produce an estimate of ultimate incurred losses   · expected loss method — utilizes an expected ultimate loss ratio based on historical experience adjusted for trends multiplied by earned premium to project ultimate losses   for each method losses are projected to the ultimate amount to be paid  the company then analyzes the results and may emphasize or deemphasize some or all of the outcomes to reflect actuarial judgment regarding their reasonableness in relation to supplementary information and operational and industry changes for example the incurred development method is emphasized in the estimation of our shorttail lines of business while the incurred bf method is emphasized in the estimation of our longtail lines of business these outcomes are then aggregated to produce a single selected point estimate that is the basis for the internal actuarial department’s point estimate for loss reserves   in determining the level of emphasis that may be placed on some or all of the methods internal actuaries periodically review statistical information as to which methods are most appropriate whether adjustments are appropriate within the particular methods and if results produced by each method include inherent bias reflecting operational and industry changes this supplementary information may include   · open and closed claim counts   · statistics related to open and closed claim count percentages   · claim closure rates   · changes in average case reserves and average loss and lae incurred on open claims   · reported and ultimate average case incurred changes   · reported and projected ultimate loss ratios and   · loss payment patterns   when reviewing reserves described in this section we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of numerous factors such as  individual claim information  industry and the historical loss experience  legislative enactments judicial decisions legal developments in the imposition of damages and changes in political attitudes and  trends in general economic conditions including the effects of inflation this process assumes that past experience adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future events there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors the key assumptions we use in our determination of appropriate reserve levels include the underlying actuarial methodologies consideration of pricing and underwriting initiatives an evaluation of retention levels and consideration of any claims handling impact on paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods   with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december   and   if circumstances bear out our assumptions losses incurred in  should develop similarly to losses incurred in  and prior years thus if the net loss ratio for premiums written in a given accident year is  we expect that the net loss ratio for premiums written in that same accident year evolving in year  would also be   however due to the inherent uncertainty in the loss development factors our actual liabilities may differ significantly from our original estimates   the reserve range below provides a sensitivity analysis regarding a range of reserve estimates considered to be reasonable based on current information and normal variations in actuals losses and assumptions  this range was developed based on actuarial judgment of the potential variance in key loss reserve factors which influence ultimate frequency and severity that can cause favorable or unfavorable development in loss reserves  however due to the    table of contents inherent uncertainty involved with projecting future loss events the reserve range does not include all possible outcomes and our actual liabilities may differ significantly from our original reserve estimates  our analysis does not anticipate any extraordinary changes in the legal social or economic environments that could affect the ultimate outcome of claims or the emergence of claims from causes not currently recognized in the historical data such extraordinary changes or claim emergence may impact the level of required reserves in ways that are not presently quantifiable thus while we believe our reserve estimates are reasonable given the information currently available it must be recognized that actual emergence of losses could deviate perhaps significantly from our estimates and the amounts recorded by the company   loss reserves evaluated as of december    in millions               sensitivity range      net   loss  lae reserves   low end of the range       carried reserves       high end of the range         the resulting range derived from this sensitivity analysis would have increased net reserves by approximately  million or decreased net reserves by approximately  million at december    the increase would have reduced pretax net income and stockholders’ equity by approximately  million  the decrease would have increased pretax net income and stockholders’ equity by approximately  million  a change in our reserves for net losses and lae would not have an immediate impact on our liquidity but would affect cash flow in future periods as the losses are paid   given the numerous factors and assumptions used in our estimates of net reserves for losses and lae and consequently this sensitivity analysis we do not believe that it would be meaningful to provide more detailed disclosure regarding specific factors and assumptions and the individual effects of these factors and assumptions on our net reserves furthermore there is no precise method for subsequently reevaluating the impact of any specific factor or assumption on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple interdependent factors      table of contents reconciliation of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves   the table below shows the reconciliation of loss reserves on a gross and net basis

because such estimates are subject to the outcome of future events loss trends vary and time is required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development or reserve releases       the estimate for ultimate losses incurred on a net basis related to prior years increased by  million in  increased by  million in  and decreased by  million in  the unfavorable development in  is primarily related to reserve strengthening on runoff programs in our program services segment  million  the    table of contents unfavorable development in  is primarily related to reserve strengthening on runoff programs in our program services segment  million  the favorable development in  is primarily due to  million of favorable development in our lender services segment  all of these changes were the result of the reestimation of unpaid losses and lae due to ongoing analyses of recent loss development trends as new data becomes available we had no significant changes in reserving assumptions or methodologies  see “notes to consolidated financial statements—note  losses and loss adjustment expenses” in part iv of this report   technology   our lender services segment uses proprietary systems which are designed to deliver and manage the cpi business our proprietary insurance tracking system insurtrak delivers realtime visibility to us and our clients into the most current borrower insurance information in addition to insurtrak the other key aspects of the it platform include the system of record for policy administration and the claims system  our program services segment also uses proprietary systems key systems include the system of record for accounting transactions the collateral management system and a projection system   employees   we had over  employees at december   none of whom is covered by a collective bargaining agreement  we believe that our employee relationships are good   regulation   general   we are subject to extensive regulation in the united states  snic and its whollyowned subsidiaries nsic and usic together operate in all fifty states and the district of columbia  cnic is a whollyowned subsidiary of usic and operates in fourtynine states and the district of columbia  snic nsic and cnic are texas domiciled insurers while usic is domiciled in delaware   state insurance regulation   insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the jurisdiction in which they are domiciled and to a lesser extent other jurisdictions in which they are authorized to conduct business the primary purpose of such regulatory powers is to protect individual policyholders state insurance authorities have broad regulatory supervisory and administrative powers including among other things the power to a grant and revoke licenses to transact business including individual lines of authority b set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained c determine the nature of and limitations on investments and dividends d approve policy rules rates and forms prior to issuance e regulate and conduct specific examinations regarding marketing unfair trade claims and fraud prevention and investigation practices and f conduct periodic comprehensive examinations of the financial condition of insurance companies domiciled in their state in particular commercial policy rates and forms are closely regulated in all states   financial oversight   reporting requirements   our insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles and other reports with the departments of insurance in all states in which they are licensed to transact business either directly or through the naic these reports include details concerning claims reserves held by the insurer specific investments held by the insurer and numerous other disclosures about the insurer’s financial condition and operations these financial statements are subject to periodic examination by the department of insurance in each state in which they are filed      table of contents investments   state insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments certain investments are prohibited   state insurance department examinations   as part of their regulatory oversight process state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed financial examinations of insurance companies domiciled in their states generally once every three to five years examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the naic   a second type of regulatory oversight examination of insurance companies involves a review by an insurance department of an authorized company’s market conduct which entails a review and examination of a company’s compliance with laws governing marketing underwriting rating policyissuance claimshandling and other aspects of its insurance business during a specified period of time   the results of these examinations can give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial injunctive or other corrective action on the part of the company that is the subject of the examination or assessing fines or other penalties against that company   riskbased capital regulations   our insurance subsidiaries are required to report their riskbased capital based on a formula developed and adopted by the naic that attempts to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in the insurer’s mix of products and investment portfolio the formula is designed to allow insurance regulators to identify weaklycapitalized companies under the formula a company determines its “riskbased capital” by taking into account certain risks related to the insurer’s assets including risks related to its investment portfolio and ceded reinsurance and the insurer’s liabilities including underwriting risks related to the nature and experience of its insurance business the departments of insurance in our domiciliary states of texas and delaware generally require a minimum total adjusted riskbased capital equal to  of an insurance company’s authorized control level riskbased capital each of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted riskbased capital in excess of  of the authorized control level as of december     in our calculation of riskbased capital for snic and nsic we have deducted amounts for which snic and nsic hold collateral for amounts recoverable from reinsurers  we believe this practice to be appropriate because we bear little credit risk for the related reinsurance balances due to the protection provided by the collateral  this practice differs from naic statutory annual statement instructions  there is no monetary effect on net income or statutory surplus from the use of this practice  if we would have used the practice outlined in naic annual statement instructions the riskbased capital calculation for snic and nsic would not have triggered a regulatory event    insurance regulatory information system ratios   the naic insurance regulatory information system “iris” is part of a collection of analytical tools designed to provide state insurance regulators with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states  iris is intended to assist state insurance regulators in targeting resources to those insurers in greatest need of regulatory attention  iris consists of two phases statistical and analytical in the statistical phase the naic database generates key financial ratio results based on financial information obtained from insurers’ annual statutory statements  the analytical phase is a review of the annual statements financial ratios and other automated solvency tools  the primary goal of the analytical phase is to identify companies that appear to require immediate regulatory attention  a ratio result falling outside the usual range of iris ratios is not considered a failing result rather unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system  furthermore in some years it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges  an    table of contents insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are in themselves immaterial or because of certain reinsurance or pooling structures or changes in such structures   in  and  our insurance subsidiaries other than cnic had two ratios departing from the usual range of values  it is not uncommon for our insurance subsidiaries to have unusual values for a few iris ratios because of our specialized business model  these deviations are primarily caused by the high volume of ceded premium in our program services segment and the low interest rate environment over the last few years along with a lower investment yield in snic because a large portion of its investment portfolio is investment in subsidiaries  in  cnic our recently acquired licensed shell company through which we have not yet written business had four ratios depart from the usual range of values related to the company’s purchase of cnic   statutory accounting principles   statutory accounting principles “sap” are a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies sap is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer’s solvency statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer’s domiciliary state   gaap is concerned with a company’s solvency but is also concerned with other financial measurements principally income and cash flows accordingly gaap gives more consideration to appropriately matching revenue and expenses and accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than does sap as a direct result different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap as compared to sap   potential restrictions on fronting   in certain states including florida and kentucky the insurance commissioner has the authority to prohibit an authorized insurer from acting as an issuing carrier for an unauthorized insurer  in addition insurance departments in states in which there is no statutory or regulatory prohibition against an authorized insurer acting as an issuing carrier for an unauthorized insurer could deem the assuming insurer to be transacting insurance business without a license and the issuing carrier to be aiding and abetting the unauthorized sale of insurance notwithstanding these state law restrictions on ceding insurers the nonadmitted and reinsurance reform act “nrra” contained in the doddfrank act provides that all laws of a ceding insurer’s nondomestic state except those with respect to taxes and assessments on insurers or insurance income are preempted to the extent that they otherwise apply the laws of the state to reinsurance agreements of nondomestic ceding insurers the nrra places the power to regulate reinsurer financial solvency primarily with the reinsurer’s domiciliary state and requires credit for reinsurance to be recognized for a nondomestic ceding company if it is allowed by the ceding company’s domiciliary state   credit for reinsurance   state insurance laws permit us insurance companies as ceding insurers to take financial statement credit for reinsurance that is ceded so long as the assuming reinsurer satisfies the state’s credit for reinsurance laws  the nrra provides that if the state of domicile of a ceding insurer is an naic accredited state or has financial solvency requirements substantially similar to the requirements necessary for naic accreditation and recognizes credit for reinsurance for the insurer’s ceded risk then no other state may deny such credit for reinsurance  because all states are currently accredited by the naic the doddfrank act prohibits a state in which a us ceding insurer is licensed but not domiciled from denying credit for reinsurance for the insurer’s ceded risk if the cedant’s domestic state regulator recognizes credit for reinsurance  the ceding company in this instance is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the ceding company’s liability for unearned premium which are that portion of premiums written which applies to the unexpired portion of the policy period loss reserves and loss expense reserves to the extent ceded to the reinsurer      table of contents holding company regulation   we qualify as a holding company system under stateenacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance regulatory agency of its state of domicile and periodically furnish information concerning its operations and transactions particularly with other companies within the holding company system that may materially affect its operations management or financial condition   transactions with affiliates   the insurance laws in most of those states provide that all transactions among members of an insurance holding company system must be fair and reasonable these laws require disclosure of material transactions within the holding company system and in some cases prior notice of or approval for certain transactions including among other things a the payment of certain dividends b cost sharing agreements c intercompany agency service or management agreements d acquisition or divestment of control of or merger with domestic insurers e sales purchases exchanges loans or extensions of credit guarantees or investments if such transactions are equal to or exceed certain thresholds and f reinsurance agreements all transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation   dividends   our insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements as to maintenance of policyholders’ surplus and payment of dividends in general including in our domiciliary states the maximum amount of dividends that the insurance subsidiaries may pay in any month period without regulatory approval is the greater of adjusted statutory net income or  of statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the preceding calendar year end adjusted statutory net income is generally defined for this purpose to be statutory net income net of realized capital gains for the calendar year preceding the date of the dividend the maximum amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries could pay without regulatory approval was  million and  million as of december   and  respectively also most states including texas and delaware restrict an insurance company’s ability to pay dividends in excess of its statutory unassigned surplus or earned surplus in addition state insurance regulators may limit or restrict an insurance company’s ability to pay shareholder dividends or as a condition to issuance of a certificate of authority as a condition to a change of control approval or for other regulatory reasons   enterprise risk and other new developments   in december  the naic adopted amendments to the model insurance holding company system regulation act and regulation the “amended model act and regulation” to introduce the concept of “enterprise risk” within an insurance company holding system “enterprise risk” is defined as any activity circumstance event or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that if not remedied promptly is likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or the liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole the amended model act and regulation imposes more extensive informational requirements on an insurance holding company system in order to protect the licensed insurance companies from enterprise risk including requiring it to prepare an annual enterprise risk report that identifies the material risks within the insurance company holding system that could pose enterprise risk to the licensed insurer in addition the amended model act and regulation requires any controlling person of a domestic insurer seeking to divest its controlling interest in the domestic insurer to file a notice of its proposed divestiture which may be subject to approval by the insurance commissioner  many states have adopted some or all of the changes in the amended model act and regulation including texas and delaware where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled the naic has made certain sections of the amendments part of its accreditation standards for state solvency regulation which may motivate more states to adopt the amendments   change of control   state insurance holding company laws require prior approval by the respective state insurance departments of any change of control of an insurer “control” is generally defined as the possession direct or indirect of the power to direct    table of contents or cause the direction of the management and policies of the company whether through the ownership of voting securities by contract or otherwise control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of  or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company any person wishing to acquire control of us or of any substantial portion of our outstanding shares would first be required to obtain the approval of the domestic regulators of our insurance subsidiaries and in any other state in which the company may be deemed to be commercially domiciled by reason of concentration of its insurance business within such state and may also require prenotification in certain other states obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of or deter any such transaction   in addition insurance laws in many states including texas and delaware the domiciliary states of our insurance company subsidiaries contain provisions that require pre and postnotification to the insurance departments of a change of control of certain nondomestic insurance companies licensed in those states as well as postnotification of a change of control of certain agencies and thirdparty administrators texas has a prior notification for a change of control of an insurance agency and third party administrator   these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change of control of us including through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable   market conduct   regulation of insurance rates and approval of policy forms   the insurance laws of most states in which we conduct business require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval if as permitted in some states we begin using new rates before they are approved we may be required to issue refunds or credits to the policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair and disapproved by the applicable state regulator in other states prior approval of rate changes is required and there may be long delays in the approval process or the rates may not be approved accordingly our ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state can be adversely affected   underwriting   the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact on credit of extraordinary life events eg catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations that regulate or prohibit the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit information the use of credit information continues to be a regulatory and legislative issue and it is possible that the us congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting its use in underwriting and rating limitations on the ability to charge policy fees   unfair claims practices   generally insurance companies adjusting companies and individual claims adjusters are prohibited by state statutes from engaging in unfair claims practices on a flagrant basis or with such frequency to indicate a general business practice unfair claims practices include   · misrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue   · failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies    table of contents   · failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation and settlement of claims arising under its policies   · failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time after proof of loss statements have been completed   · attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a reasonable person would have believed such person was entitled   · attempting to settle claims on the basis of an application that was altered without notice to or knowledge or consent of the insured   · compelling insureds to institute suits to recover amounts due under policies by offering substantially less than the amounts ultimately recovered in suits brought by them   · refusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation   · making claim payments to an insured without indicating the coverage under which each payment is being made   · delaying the investigation or payment of claims by requiring an insured claimant or the physician of either to submit a preliminary claim report and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal proof of loss forms both of which submissions contains substantially the same information   · failing in the case of claim denials or offers of compromise or settlement to promptly provide a reasonable and accurate explanation of the basis for such actions and   · not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear   guaranty fund assessments   most if not all of the states where we are licensed to transact business require that property and casualty insurers doing business within the state participate in a guaranty association which is organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired insolvent or failed insurers these associations levy assessments up to prescribed limits on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by the member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired insolvent or failed insurer is engaged some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets   property and casualty insurance company insolvencies or failures may result in additional guaranty association assessments to our insurance subsidiaries at some future date at this time we are unable to determine the impact if any such assessments may have on their financial positions or results of their operations as of december   each of our insurance subsidiaries has established accruals for guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings   creditorplaced insurance   the naic creditorplaced insurance model act “creditorplaced model act” applies to insurance placed in connection with automobile loans and creates a legal framework within which creditorplaced insurance may be written and helps to maintain the separation between creditors and insurers  it also serves to minimize the possibilities of unfair competitive practices in the sale of creditorplaced insurance the creditorplaced model act has only been adopted by a few states including arkansas michigan mississippi and tennessee but other states have also adopted laws and regulations that cover creditorplaced insurance  there could be an effort especially from consumer groups to expand    table of contents the protections and breadth of the creditorplaced model act  the naic property and casualty insurance committee is currently reviewing the model act and is tentatively scheduled to provide its proposed revisions if any in    restrictions on withdrawal cancellation and nonrenewal   in addition many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to withdraw from a particular market for example states may limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or not renew policies furthermore certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove any proposed plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit cancellation and nonrenewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to exit unprofitable markets   required licensing   our texas domiciled insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by the department of insurance in the states in which they sell insurance our delaware insurance subsidiary operates under a license issued by the delaware department of insurance but in all other state and the district of columbia writes on a nonadmitted and surplus lines basis if a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license our ability to offer new insurance products in that market may be substantially impaired in addition if the department of insurance in any state in which one of our insurance subsidiaries currently operates suspends nonrenews or revokes an existing license we would not be able to offer affected products in the state   licensing of producers and other entities   insurance agencies producers thirdparty administrators claims adjusters and service contract providers and administrators are subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states in which they conduct business our agency and services company tba insurance group ltd engages in certain of these functions and is subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states   federal and state legislative and regulatory changes   from time to time various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry among the proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to or in lieu of the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures some of which have been enacted to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the naic the naic has undertaken a solvency modernization initiative focused on updating the us insurance solvency regulation framework including capital requirements governance and risk management group supervision accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance the amended model act and regulation discussed above is a result of these efforts additional requirements are also expected for example the naic has adopted the risk management and own risk and solvency assessment “orsa” model act which when adopted by the states will require insurers to perform an orsa and upon request of a state file an orsa summary report with the state the company met the required threshold for filing the orsa summary report in  and filed its first report in    on july   the president signed into law the doddfrank act that established a federal insurance office within the us department of the treasury the federal insurance office “fio” initially is charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry other than health insurance certain longterm care insurance and crop insurance gathering data and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the united states  on december   the fio issued a report as required under the doddfrank act entitled “how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the united states” the “report” which stated that given the “uneven” progress the states have made with several nearterm state reforms should the states fail to accomplish the necessary modernization reforms in the near term “congress should strongly consider direct federal involvement” the fio continues to support the current statebased regulatory regime but will consider federal    table of contents regulation should the states fail to take steps to greater uniformity eg federal licensing of insurers the report also appears to signal greater activity by the federal government in dealing with nonus regulators and regulatory regimes using the authority expressly given by the doddfrank act to the us department of the treasury and the united states trade representative to negotiate “covered agreements” with foreign authorities the report also makes recommendations in the areas of insurance sector solvency and marketplace regulation each year the fio also releases an annual report on the insurance industry “annual report” with its latest annual report released in september of  the annual report provided a set of recommendations along with providing an overview of the financial performance and condition of the us insurance industry and outlining a number of insurance industry and regulatory developments from the past year   in addition the doddfrank act gives the federal reserve supervisory authority over a number of financial services companies including insurance companies if they are designated by a twothirds vote of a financial stability oversight council as “systemically important” if an insurance company is designated as systemically important the federal reserve’s supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial regulation upon that insurance company and could impact requirements regarding its capital liquidity and leverage as well as its business and investment conduct   the doddfrank act also incorporates the nrra which became effective on july   among other things the nrra establishes national uniform standards on how states may regulate and tax surplus lines insurance and sets national standards concerning the regulation of reinsurance in particular the nrra gives regulators in the home state of an insured exclusive authority to regulate and tax surplus lines insurance transactions and regulators in a ceding insurer’s state of domicile the sole responsibility for regulating the balance sheet credit that the ceding insurer may take for reinsurance recoverables   other possible federal regulatory developments include the introduction of legislation in congress that would repeal the mccarranferguson act antitrust exemption for the insurance industry the antitrust exemption allows insurers to compile and share loss data develop standard policy forms and manuals and predict future loss costs with greater reliability among other things the ability of the industry under the exemption permitted in the mccarranferguson act to collect loss cost data and build a credible database as a means of predicting future loss costs is an important part of costbased pricing if the ability to collect this data were removed the predictability of future loss costs and the reliability of pricing could be undermined   privacy regulations   in  congress enacted the grammleachbliley act which among other things protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal information subsequently states have implemented additional regulations to address privacy issues certain aspects of these laws and regulations apply to all financial institutions including insurance and finance companies and require us to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our policyholders we may also be subject to future privacy laws and regulations which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition in  the naic adopted the privacy of consumer financial and health information model regulation which assisted states in promulgating regulations to comply with the grammleachbliley act in  to further facilitate the implementation of the grammleachbliley act the naic adopted the standards for safeguarding customer information model regulation many states have now adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of policyholder information   telephone sales regulations   the united states congress the federal communications commission and various states have promulgated and enacted rules and laws that govern telephone solicitations there are numerous state statutes and regulations governing telephone sales activities that do or may apply to our operations including the operations of our call center insurance agencies for example some states place restrictions on the methods and timing of calls and require that certain    table of contents mandatory disclosures be made during the course of a telephone sales call federal and state “do not call” regulations must be followed for us to engage in telephone sales activities     available information   our company website address is

commission’s internet site at httpwwwsecgov   item a risk factor s   you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion of risk factors includes forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in such forwardlooking statements see “note on forwardlooking statements” in item  of this report   risks relating to our program services segment   we may not be able to recover amounts due from our reinsurers which would adversely affect our financial condition   our program services segment offers fronting arrangements to domestic and foreign insurers that want to access specific us property and casualty insurance business which we collectively refer to as “capacity providers” and generally reinsure on a quota share basis  of the risk under these policies with these carriers in exchange for ceding fees  because we cede substantially all of these risks to capacity providers we generally hold no net reserves for losses or lae that might arise as a result of claims made under these policies however as the issuer of the policies we remain directly liable to these policyholders   we reinsure substantially all of the underwriting and operating risks in connection with our fronting arrangements to our capacity providers  we take the risk of insolvency or other failure to pay by a capacity provider we generally select either well capitalized highly rated authorized capacity providers or we require the capacity providers to post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks  however if any of our capacity providers becomes insolvent or otherwise refuses to reimburse losses paid to these policyholders or us to the extent we reimburse or pay policyholders or pay    table of contents other claims directly in a timely manner the corresponding impact to our liability for these claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we often hold collateral to protect us against a capacity provider’s failure to pay claims however collateral may not be sufficient to cover our liability for these claims and we may not be able to cause the capacity provider to deliver additional collateral   as of december   we held  billion in collateral securing  billion in reinsurance recoverables  the remaining unsecured reinsurance recoverables of  are ceded to highlyrated well capitalized reinsurers  our reinsurance recoverables are based on estimates and our actual liabilities may exceed the amount that we are able to recover from our capacity providers or any collateral securing the liabilities this could occur because the loss experience is higher than expected or due to litigation regulatory or other extracontractual liabilities   if we fail to realize a reinsurance recoverable owed under these arrangements due to insolvency dispute or other unwillingness or inability of any of our reinsurers to meet their obligations to us or due to our inability to access sufficient collateral to cover our liabilities our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected  for additional information see “business—reinsurance” in item  of this report   if market conditions cause our reinsurance to be more costly or difficult to obtain we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments   in our program services segment we provide access to the us property and casualty markets in exchange for ceding fees through our fronting business by providing access to our “a” excellent am best rating expansive licensing and reputation  as part of our business strategy for our program services segment we reinsure substantially all underwriting risk credit risk and business risk related to our fronting business  we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance arrangements or to obtain other reinsurance in adequate amounts and at favorable rates particularly if reinsurers become unwilling or unable to support our specialized fronting model in the future in recent years our program services segment has benefitted from favorable market conditions including growth in the role of general agents “gas” and of nonus and other alternative sources of reinsurance  a decline in the availability of reinsurance increases in the cost of reinsurance or a decreased level of activity by gas could limit the amount of fronting business we could write and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   regulators may challenge our use of fronting arrangements in states in which our capacity providers are not licensed   we enter into fronting arrangements with gas and domestic and foreign insurers that want to access specific us property and casualty insurance business in states in which such capacity provider is not licensed or is not authorized to write particular lines of insurance the capacity provider or the ga administers the business settles all claims and reinsures substantially all of the risks we receive ceding fees but generally do not share in the profits or losses of the business we write for the capacity provider some state insurance regulators may object to our fronting arrangements  in certain states including florida the insurance commissioner has the authority to prohibit an authorized insurer from acting as an issuing carrier for an unauthorized insurer  in addition insurance departments in states in which there is no statutory or regulatory prohibition against an authorized insurer acting as an issuing carrier for an unauthorized insurer such as new york could deem the assuming insurer to be transacting insurance business without a license and the issuing carrier to be aiding and abetting the unauthorized sale of insurance   if regulators in any of the states where we conduct our fronting business were to prohibit or limit the arrangement we would be prevented or limited from conducting that business for which a capacity provider is not authorized in those states unless and until the capacity provider is able to obtain the necessary licenses this could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects  in particular we do significant business in florida  see “—we write at least half of our program services business in several key states and adverse developments in these key states could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects”   notwithstanding these state law restrictions on ceding insurers the nonadmitted and reinsurance reform act “nrra” contained in the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act”    table of contents provides that all laws of a ceding insurer’s nondomestic state except those with respect to taxes and assessments on insurers or insurance income are preempted to the extent that they otherwise apply the laws of the state to reinsurance agreements of nondomestic ceding insurers the nrra places the power to regulate reinsurer financial solvency primarily with the reinsurer’s domiciliary state and requires credit for reinsurance to be recognized for a nondomestic ceding company if it is allowed by the ceding company’s domiciliary state  a state insurance regulator might not view the nrra as preempting a state regulator’s determination that an unauthorized reinsurer must obtain a license or that a statute prohibited our doing a fronting business however such a determination or a conflict between state law and the nrra could cause regulatory uncertainty about our fronting business which could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   changes in state insurance regulation could materially and adversely affect our business   some states have adopted changes to their insurance laws and regulations that permit insurers to obtain credit for reinsurance from reinsurers who are able to post reduced collateral if they satisfy certain requirements including specific rating criteria  we require many of our capacity providers to post collateral to secure their reinsurance obligations  if regulatory changes are adopted in the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled that permit nonadmitted reinsurers to post reduced or no collateral in order for the insurer to obtain credit for that reinsurance it may become more difficult for us to obtain collateral from our capacity providers who meet the applicable rating agency requirements which could materially and adversely affect the amount of business that we can write   we depend on a limited number of capacity providers and general agents for a large portion of our gross written premium in our program services segment and the loss of business provided by any one of them could materially and adversely affect us   our program services segment offers fronting arrangements to both gas and capacity providers  capacity providers may be under common control with a particular ga or they be independent  an independent capacity provider may reinsure a single book or multiple books with various gas  a single ga may control a single book with one capacity provider or multiple books with various capacity providers   other insurance companies compete with us for this business these capacity providers and gas may choose to enter into fronting arrangements with our competitors or gas or capacity providers may terminate fronting arrangements with us if they no longer need access to our fronting capacity or for other reasons   our top five gas measured by ceding fees for the year ended december   accounted for approximately     and  of our ceding fees in our program services segment respectively for the years ended december    and  approximately   and  of our ceding fees in our program services segment was derived from our top two fronting arrangements our top ga controlled by a single capacity provider for the year ended december   was meadowbrook at  of program services ceding fees and  of total consolidated revenues   our top five capacity providers measured by premium volume for the year ended december   accounted for approximately     and  of our gross written premium in our program services segment  for the years ended december    and  approximately   and  of our gross written premium in our program services segment was derived from our top two capacity providers much of the business concentrated with these capacity providers is also included in the business concentrated with the gas noted above   a significant decrease in business from or the entire loss of our largest capacity provider or ga or several of our other large capacity providers or gas would cause us to lose premium and require us to seek additional capacity providers or gas or to replace the lost premium in the event that we are unable to do so our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be materially and adversely affected      table of contents failure of capacity providers or gas to properly market underwrite or administer policies could adversely affect us   the marketing underwriting claims administration and other administration of policies in our program services segment are the responsibility of our capacity providers or our gas  any failure by them to properly handle these functions could result in liability to us  even though they may be required to compensate us for any such liability there are risks that any such failures could create regulatory or reputational issues for us and that they do not pay us either of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   we write at least half of our program services business in several key states and adverse developments in these key states could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   for the years ended december    and  we derived approximately   and  of our gross written premium in our program services segment in the states of california texas florida and new york  as a result our financial results are subject to prevailing regulatory legal economic demographic competitive and other conditions in these states  adverse developments relating to any of these conditions could have a material and adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects see “business—program services segment—geographic distribution”   we may not be successful in building more direct relationships with gas and capacity providers through a direct marketing campaign   historically our fronting capacity has been constrained by the size of our capital base and we have relied on our relationshipdriven channels to generate new fronting business with only a modest sales and marketing effort in addition we have historically relied on brokers to identify gas in need of fronting  although we continue to build direct relationships with gas and capacity providers and have hired additional fullydedicated sales staff we may not be successful in our efforts to further expand our fronting business   we may face increased competition in our program services segment   we believe there are relatively few active competitors in our program services segment  we compete primarily on the basis of price customer service geographic coverage financial strength ratings licenses reputation business model experience and generally not offering state national’s products for our own account  our principal competitors are companies such as james river group holdings ltd clear blue financial holdings llc spinnaker insurance company amtrust financial services inc and argo group  unlike us some of our competitors may offer policy administration or other services or be willing to take on significant underwriting risk any increase in competition in this segment especially by one or more substantial companies could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   some of our fronting arrangements contain limits on the reinsurer’s obligations to us   while we reinsure substantially all of the risks inherent in our fronting programs we have in certain cases entered into programs that contain limits on our reinsurers’ obligations to us including loss ratio caps aggregate reinsurance limits or exclusion of the credit risk of gas for example under our program with nephila capital ltd we bear no business or insurance risk except for annual aggregate agreement year losses in excess of a limit that we believe is highly unlikely to be exceeded  to the extent losses under these programs exceed the prescribed limits we will be liable to pay the losses in excess of such limits which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   our losses resulting from the runoff of the retained business may exceed our reserves   in the past we have participated on a quota share basis to a limited extent in certain programs in the program services segment  in early  we reinsured to inception the retained business under most of the active contracts but others continue to runoff see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of    table of contents operations—factors affecting our operating results—runoff of the retained business” in item  of this report  as of december   we had reserves of  million related to this business  in the event our losses resulting from this business exceeds our reserves the excess losses could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   risks relating to our lender services segment   lenderplaced residential hazard insurance is under increased regulatory scrutiny and has been subject to regulatory changes at both the federal and state levels if lenderplaced automobile insurance becomes subject to similar regulatory scrutiny and is affected by regulatory changes our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected   through our lender services segment we provide collateral protection insurance or cpi to financial institutions  other companies provide similar products to home lenders  under certain circumstances when borrowers fail to provide hazard insurance on their residences the owner or servicer of the loan may place such insurance to protect the collateral and pass on the premium to the borrower this lenderplaced residential hazard insurance has come under increased regulatory scrutiny and has been subject to regulatory changes  for example fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage servicers and their affiliates may not receive commissions or other forms of compensation with lenderplaced insurance on governmentsponsored enterprise “gse” loans or ceding premiums to a reinsurer affiliated with the servicers  in addition state regulators have also taken action to restrict insurance practices related to lenderplaced residential hazard insurance   in the future states or the federal government may subject lenderplaced automobile insurance to similar regulatory scrutiny or propose regulatory changes to related laws  for example the united states governmental accountability office’s “gao” september  report on lenderplaced insurance examined both residential and personal property lenderplaced insurance  the gao recommended the naic gather additional information on the lenderplaced insurance market  in particular cpi’s higher expense ratios and lower loss ratios as compared to other insurance products presents a risk that regulatory requirements such as minimum loss ratios could be proposed in the future  any future proposed or adopted rules relating to automobile cpi could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operation and prospects   the naic creditorplaced insurance model act “creditorplaced model act” applies to insurance placed in connection with automobile loans and creates a legal framework within which creditorplaced insurance may be written and helps to maintain the separation between creditors and insurers  it also serves to minimize the possibilities of unfair competitive practices in the sale of creditorplaced insurance the creditorplaced model act has only been adopted by a few states including arkansas michigan mississippi and tennessee but other states have also adopted laws and regulations that cover creditorplaced insurance  there could be an effort especially from consumer groups to expand the protections and breadth of the creditorplaced model act  the naic property and casualty insurance committee is currently reviewing the model act and is tentatively scheduled to provide its proposed revisions if any in    the cpi market is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively against larger companies   the cpi market is highly competitive we compete on the bases of price coverages offered claims handling customer service geographic coverage financial strength ratings licenses reputation technology relationships with business partners and experience some of our competitors have substantially more capital comparable or higher ratings and greater resources than we have and offer a broader range of products than we offer  many of our competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts andor expanding their online service offerings  some of these competitors may have better brand recognition than we have and have a larger market share than we do  as a result these larger competitors may be better able to offer lower rates to customers to withstand larger losses and to more effectively take advantage of new marketing opportunities our ability to compete against these larger competitors depends on our ability to deliver superior service and maintain our relationships with our clients   we may undertake strategic marketing and operating initiatives to improve our competitive position and drive growth if we are unable to successfully implement new strategic initiatives or if our marketing campaigns do not attract    table of contents new customers our competitive position may be harmed which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   the termination of our alliance with cuna mutual could materially and adversely affect our growth prospects for our cpi business and our liquidity   our alliance with cuna mutual has allowed us to significantly increase the amount of cpi business we write due to the business that is generated by cuna mutual’s sales and marketing efforts for the years ended december    and  the cpi gross premiums written through our alliance with cuna mutual represented   and  of our total cpi business respectively  during  we amended the alliance agreement to increase our retention of the business subject to the alliance to  from  for business written on or after july   and in exchange have made payments to cuna mutual totaling  million  in addition the term of the alliance has been extended at least through july    thereafter the agreement will be automatically renewed for consecutive three year terms unless either party provides notice of nonrenewal at least twelve months prior to the expiration date   if the alliance were to terminate and we no longer had access to those extensive sales and marketing efforts our ability to continue to grow our cpi business could materially and adversely affected  cuna mutual has the right to terminate its alliance agreement with us upon a change in control of state national or certain of its subsidiaries which is defined to include any substantial change in the senior management team  see “business—lender services segment—business overview—relationship with cuna mutual” in item  of this report in addition if and when the alliance agreement terminates depending upon the reason for the termination and subject to certain exceptions we may be required to buy out cuna mutual’s right to participate in future alliance business at a price equal to the previous  months net premium times a percentage based on the loss ratio of the business during that period we estimate that the amount of this payment as of december   would be approximately  million   changes affecting the automobile loan business generally and the cpi business in particular could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   a number of economic and market conditions affect vehicle sales volume and product mix the amount of automobile loans and the cpi market including levels of unemployment consumer confidence average age of vehicles on the road availability and cost of credit cost of fuel credit profiles of borrowers and amounts sought to be financed  our cpi business has benefitted in recent periods from a strong overall automobile loan environment including increases in vehicle sales and average amounts financed  any negative changes in market conditions could materially and adversely affect demand for our cpi product offerings and consequently our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   if we are unable to establish and maintain accurate allowance for policy cancellations our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected   our financial statements include an allowance for policy cancellations which represents our best estimate of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries will ultimately refund for cpi polices that cancel net of applicable offsetting expenses as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing the allowance   as a result of these uncertainties the ultimate refunds paid may deviate perhaps substantially from the pointintime estimates of such refunds and expenses as reflected in the allowance for policy cancellations included in our financial statements  to the extent that premium refunds exceed our estimates we will be required to immediately recognize the unfavorable development and increase our allowance for policy cancellations with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the allowance is increased  consequently ultimate refunds paid could materially exceed the reported allowance for policy cancellations and have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects      table of contents risks relating to our business generally   a downgrade in the am best rating of our insurance subsidiaries would reduce the amount of business we are able to write and could materially adversely impact the competitive positions of our insurance subsidiaries   rating agencies evaluate insurance companies based on their ability to pay claims our insurance subsidiaries have been assigned an “a” excellent rating by am best company inc the ratings of am best are subject to periodic review using among other things proprietary capital adequacy models and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time our competitive position relative to other companies is determined in part by the am best rating of our insurance subsidiaries am best ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agencies and are not intended for the protection of investors or as a recommendation to buy hold or sell securities   we rely on our “a” rating from am best to operate our program services business and our lender services business  there can be no assurances that our insurance subsidiaries will be able to maintain this rating  any downgrade in ratings would likely materially adversely affect our business through the loss of certain existing and potential policyholders and the loss of relationships with clients that might move to other companies with higher ratings if we lost our “a” rating our capacity providers would likely seek a higher rated issuing carrier to write their business   our lender services segment would also be adversely affected if a large number of our accounts were to require an insurer with an “a” rating  in addition pursuant to the arrangement with cuna mutual if our am best rating falls below “a” for more than  consecutive days cuna mutual will be entitled to terminate the arrangement with us and thereafter cuna mutual will have the option to purchase our right to participate in the future business of the alliance  we are not able to quantify the percentage of our business in terms of premiums or otherwise that would be affected by a downgrade in our am best ratings   if we are unable to accurately underwrite risks and charge competitive yet profitable rates to our clients and policyholders our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected   in general the premiums for our insurance policies are established at the time a policy is issued and therefore before all of our underlying costs are known like other insurance companies we rely on estimates and assumptions in setting our premium rates establishing adequate premiums is necessary together with investment income to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses loss adjustment expenses “lae” and other underwriting costs and to earn a profit if we do not accurately assess the risks that we assume we may not charge adequate premiums to cover our losses and expenses which would negatively affect our results of operations and our financial condition alternatively we could set our premiums too high which could reduce our competitiveness and lead to lower revenues in addition a variety of economic factors can affect losses in our cpi business for example difficult economic conditions could lead to increased losses as a result of increased premium deficiency and conversionskip claims   pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical loss data and the projection of future trends loss costs and expenses and inflation trends among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets in order to accurately price our policies we   · collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data from our insureds   · develop test and apply appropriate projections and rating formulas   · closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends and   · project expected losses for our insureds with reasonable accuracy      table of contents we seek to implement our pricing accurately in accordance with our assumptions our ability to undertake these efforts successfully and as a result accurately price our policies is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including   · insufficient or unreliable data   · incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data   · uncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions   · our failure to implement appropriate actuarial projections and rating formulas or other pricing methodologies   · regulatory constraints on rate increases   · our failure to accurately estimate investment yields and the duration of our liability for loss and lae and   · unanticipated court decisions legislation or regulatory action   our failure to accurately and timely pay claims could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   we must accurately and timely evaluate and pay claims that are made under our cpi and other policies many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately and timely including the training and experience of our claims representatives our claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of our management our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and other factors our failure to pay claims accurately and timely could lead to regulatory and administrative actions material litigation undermining our reputation in the marketplace and materially and adversely affecting our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   in addition if we do not train new claims employees effectively or lose a significant number of experienced claims employees our claims department’s ability to handle an increasing workload could be adversely affected in addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets our business could suffer from decreased quality of claims work which in turn could lower our operating margins   our insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action   the laws of the states of domicile of our insurance subsidiaries impose riskbased capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements failure to meet applicable riskbased capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements could subject us to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators including limitations on our writing of additional business state supervision or liquidation any changes in existing riskbased capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements may require us to increase our statutory capital levels which we may be unable to do   if we are unable to establish and maintain accurate loss reserves our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected   our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing insurance loss reserves   as a result of these uncertainties the ultimate paid loss and lae may deviate perhaps substantially from the pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements  to the extent that loss and lae exceed our estimates we will be required to immediately recognize the unfavorable    table of contents development and increase loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the reserve levels are increased  consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   catastrophic losses or the frequency of smaller insured losses may exceed our expectations which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   our insurance business is subject to claims arising from catastrophes such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots and hazardous material releases the incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial  in our program services business although we reinsure substantially all of the underwriting risk through our fronting arrangements a catastrophe loss could impair the ability of one or more of our reinsurers to pay all of the reinsured claims in which case we would be responsible for paying any claims not paid by our reinsurers in our lender services business it is possible that we may experience an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period in either case the consequences could be substantial volatility in our financial condition or results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year which could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects or our ability to write new business   ongoing economic uncertainty could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   global economies and financial markets have experienced significant weakness and volatility since  although the most extreme of these circumstances have abated since that time despite improved financial market performance since  nearterm us economic prospects have only very gradually improved in addition us federal and state governments continue to experience significant structural fiscal deficits creating uncertainty as to levels of taxation inflation regulation and other economic fundamentals that may impact future growth prospects significantly greater economic fiscal and monetary uncertainty remains in europe due to the combination of poor economic growth high unemployment and significant sovereign deficits continuation of these conditions may potentially affect among other aspects of our business the demand for and claims made under our products the ability of clients counterparties and others to establish or maintain their relationships with us our ability to access and efficiently use internal and external capital resources and our investment performance in the event that these conditions persist and result in a prolonged period of economic uncertainty our business financial condition results of operations our prospects and competitor landscape could be materially and adversely affected      table of contents our business is dependent on the efforts of our executive officers and other personnel  if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to attract train and retain qualified personnel our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected   our success is dependent on the efforts of our executive officers because of their industry expertise knowledge of our markets and relationships with our clients  our executive officers are   · terry ledbetter chairman and chief executive officer   · matthew freeman president   · david hale executive vice president chief operating officer and chief financial officer   · john pearson executive vice president and national sales manager   · trace ledbetter executive vice president of service   · david cleff executive vice president of business affairs general counsel and secretary and   · luke ledbetter executive vice president and chief underwriting officer of program services   we have agreements with our executive officers that contain certain noncompete and nonsolicit provisions  nonetheless should any of our executive officers cease working for us we may be unable to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and experience in the niche markets that we target  in addition our business is also dependent on other skilled employees  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract train and retain on a timely basis and on anticipated economic and other terms experienced and capable senior management underwriters and support staff  we intend to pay competitive salaries bonuses and equitybased rewards in order to attract and retain such personnel but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such endeavors the loss of key personnel or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results  we do not currently maintain life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers or other employees   if we are unable to maintain our technology platform or our technology platform fails to operate properly or meet the technological demands of our clients with respect to the products and services we offer our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected   if we are unable to properly maintain our insurtrak system and the remainder of our technology systems or if our technology systems otherwise fail to perform in the manner we currently contemplate our ability to effectively underwrite and issue policies process claims and perform other business functions and our cpi clients’ ability to track and manage their cpi programs could be significantly impaired and our business reputation and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected in addition the success of our business is dependent on our ability to resolve any issues identified with our technology arrangements during operations and make any necessary improvements in a timely manner further we will need to match or exceed the technological capabilities of our competitors over time we cannot predict with certainty the cost of such maintenance and improvements but failure to make such improvements could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects see “business—technology”   also we use ecommerce and other technology to provide expand and market our products and services accordingly we believe that it will be essential to continue to invest resources in maintaining electronic connectivity with clients and more generally in ecommerce and technology our business may suffer if we do not maintain these arrangements or keep pace with the technological demands of our clients      table of contents if we experience security breaches or other disruptions involving our technology our ability to conduct our business could be adversely affected we could be liable to third parties and our reputation could suffer which could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   our business is dependent upon the uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunication systems we rely upon our systems as well as the systems of our vendors for all our business operations including underwriting and issuing policies processing claims providing customer service complying with insurance regulatory requirements and performing actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for underwriting pricing and product development our operations are dependent upon our ability to timely and efficiently maintain and improve our information and telecommunications systems and protect them from physical loss telecommunications failure or other similar catastrophic events as well as from security breaches a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe terrorist attack or industrial accident or due to a computer virus our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time while we have implemented business contingency plans and other reasonable and appropriate internal controls to protect our systems from interruption loss or security breaches a sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to process our business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions   our operations depend on the reliable and secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks computer viruses hackers employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches cyberattacks or other disruptions in addition we routinely transmit and receive personal confidential and proprietary information by electronic means we have implemented security measures designed to protect against breaches of security and other interference with our systems and networks resulting from attacks by third parties including hackers and from employee or advisor error or malfeasance despite these measures we cannot assure that our systems and networks will not be subject to breaches or interference any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our clients’ or insureds’ information which in turn may result in legal claims regulatory scrutiny and liability reputational damage the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure the loss of clients or affiliated advisors or other damage to our business in addition the trend toward broad consumer and general public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business financial condition and results of operations even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data we could suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities discovery of new vulnerabilities attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems data thefts physical system or network breakins or inappropriate access or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our business   if we cannot sustain our business relationships including our relationships with gas capacity providers and with clients in our lender service segment we may be unable to compete effectively and operate profitably   our relationships with our clients are generally governed by agreements that may be terminated on short notice  in our program services segment our standard reinsurance agreement provides several events of termination including among others that the agreement may be terminated by any party us the reinsurer or general agent by providing at least  days written notice to the other parties immediately upon written notice by the reinsurer or us in the event of the cancellation or nonrenewal of the general agent’s insurance license by the reinsurer after  days written notice of the general agent’s failure to pay the reinsurer the premium due by us if the reinsurer is insolvent or credit for reinsurance is disallowed or if the reinsurer is required to increase the amount of collateral or is required to secure its obligations under the agreement in specified situations and by any party in the event of a change in control of our insurance subsidiary the reinsurer or general agent   our ability to compete and remain profitable depends in part on our maintaining business relationships with our clients the marketing efforts of our sales professionals the servicing efforts of our relationship managers and on our ability to offer insurance products and maintain financial strength ratings that meet the requirements and preferences of    table of contents our clients any failure on our part to be effective in any of these areas may have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   performance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks that may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   our results are affected in part by the performance of our investment portfolio our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive investments such as fixedincome securities  as of december   our investment in fixedincome securities was approximately  million or  of our total investment portfolio increases in market interest rates may have an adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the value of fixedincome securities conversely declining market interest rates could have an adverse impact on our investment income as we invest positive cash flows from operations and as we reinvest proceeds from maturing and called investments in new investments that could yield lower rates than our investments have historically generated defaults in our investment portfolio may produce operating losses and materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies domestic and nonus economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control although we take measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively our mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio and managing the duration of the portfolio to reduce the effect of interest rate changes despite our mitigation efforts a significant change in interest rates could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   in addition the performance of our investment portfolio generally is subject to other risks including the following   · the risk of decrease in value due to a deterioration in the financial condition operating performance or business prospects of one or more issuers of our fixedincome securities   · the risk that our portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers sectors or industries   · the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis and   · general movements in the values of securities markets   if our investment portfolio were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market sector or issuerspecific conditions our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business   the insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation which may affect our ability to execute our business plan and grow our business   we are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in texas and delaware states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled as well as all states in which they are licensed sell insurance products issue policies or handle claims some states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of specific corporate actions which may adversely affect our ability to operate innovate obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow our business profitably these regulations provide safeguards for policyholders and are not intended to protect the interests of shareholders our ability to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success some of these regulations include   · required licensing we operate under licenses issued by the insurance departments in the states in which we sell insurance if a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license our ability to enter that market    table of contents quickly or offer new insurance products in that market may be substantially impaired in addition if the insurance department in any state in which we currently operate suspends nonrenews or revokes an existing license we would not be able to offer affected products in that state   · transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates transactions between us or any of our affiliates and our insurance companies generally must be disclosed and prior approval is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated approval may be refused or the time required to obtain approval may delay some transactions which may adversely affect our ability to innovate or operate efficiently  our unregulated entities receive substantial payments for services rendered to our insurance company subsidiaries pursuant to arrangements approved by insurance regulators  changes in insurance regulation could materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flow we are able to generate outside of our insurance company subsidiaries   · regulation of insurance rates and approval of policy forms the insurance laws of most states in which we conduct business require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval if as permitted in some states we begin using new rates before they are approved we may be required to issue refunds or credits to the policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair and disapproved by the applicable insurance department in other states prior approval of rate changes is required and there may be long delays in the approval process or the rates may not be approved accordingly our ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state could be adversely affected   · other regulations we must also comply with regulations involving among other matters   · the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues   · the use of credit history in underwriting and rating policies   · limitations on the ability to charge policy fees   · limitations on types and amounts of investments   · restrictions on the payment of dividends   · the acquisition or disposition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company   · involuntary assignments of highrisk policies participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations assessments and other governmental charges   · reporting with respect to financial condition   · periodic financial and market conduct examinations performed by state insurance department examiners   · reporting with respect to orsa and   · reporting with respect to the naic model audit rule   the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in regulatory actions fines and penalties and in extreme cases revocation of our ability to do business in a particular jurisdiction in the past we have been fined by state insurance departments for failing to comply with certain laws and regulations in addition we may face individual and class action lawsuits by insured and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations      table of contents regulation may become more extensive in the future which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   compliance with applicable laws and regulations is timeconsuming and personnelintensive and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business thus materially and adversely affecting our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   in the future states may make existing insurance laws and regulation more restrictive or enact new restrictive laws in such event we may seek to reduce our business in or withdraw entirely from these states additionally from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary currently the us federal government does not directly regulate the property and casualty insurance business however doddfrank act established a federal insurance office “fio” within the department of the treasury the fio initially is charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry other than health insurance certain longterm care insurance and crop insurance gathering data and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the united states on december   the fio issued a report as required under the doddfrank act entitled “how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the united states” the “report” which stated that given the “uneven” progress the states have made with several nearterm state reforms should the states fail to accomplish the necessary modernization reforms in the near term “congress should strongly consider direct federal involvement” the fio continues to support the current statebased regulatory regime but will consider federal regulation should the states fail to take steps to greater uniformity eg federal licensing of insurers the report also appears to signal greater activity by the federal government in dealing with nonus regulators and regulatory regimes using the authority expressly given by the doddfrank act to the us department of the treasury and the united states trade representative to negotiate “covered agreements” with foreign authorities each year the fio also releases an annual report on the insurance industry “annual report” with its latest annual report released in september of  the annual report provided a set of recommendations along with providing an overview of the financial performance and condition of the us insurance industry and outlining a number of insurance industry and regulatory developments from the past year  we cannot predict what impact if any this guidance or any new legislation would have on our business financial condition and results of operations see “business—regulation—federal and state legislative and regulatory changes” in item  of this report   our holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints including adverse business performance could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations   we are a holding company and conduct our business operations through our various subsidiaries our principal sources of funds are payments from our subsidiaries income from our investment portfolio and funds that may be raised from time to time in the capital markets we will be largely dependent on amounts from our subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on any indebtedness that we may incur to pay holding company operating expenses to make capital investments in our other subsidiaries repurchase shares and to pay dividends on our common stock   our insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements as to maintenance of policyholders’ surplus and payment of dividends including in their states of domicile texas and delaware  in general the maximum amount of dividends that the insurance subsidiaries may pay in any month period without regulatory approval is the greater of adjusted statutory net income or  of statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the preceding calendar year end adjusted statutory net income is generally defined for this purpose to be statutory net income net of realized capital gains for the calendar year preceding the date of the dividend in addition other states may limit or restrict our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to pay shareholder dividends generally or as a condition to issuance of a certificate of authority see “business—regulation—state insurance regulation” in item  of this report   we may require additional capital in the future and such additional capital may not be available to us or only available to us on unfavorable terms   our future capital requirements depend on many factors including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses to the extent that the funds generated by our    table of contents ongoing operations and capitalization are insufficient to fund future operating requirements we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets we cannot be sure that we will be able to raise equity or debt financing on terms favorable to us and our shareholders and in the amounts that we require or at all if we cannot obtain adequate capital our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected   in addition the terms of a capital raising transaction could require us to agree to stringent financial and operating covenants and to grant security interests on our assets to lenders or holders of our debt securities that could limit our flexibility in operating our business or our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and could make it more difficult for us to obtain capital in the future   the rates we charge under the policies we write in our program services segment and our lender services segment are subject to prior regulatory approval in most of the states in which we operate   in most of the states in which we operate through our admitted carriers we must obtain prior regulatory approval of insurance rates charged to our insureds and our clients’ insureds including any increases in those rates if we are unable to receive approval for the rate changes we request or if such approval were delayed our ability to operate our business in a profitable manner may be limited and our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected   the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain and negative developments in this area could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects   as industry practices and legal judicial social and other environmental conditions change unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge these issues may materially and adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims in some instances these changes may not become apparent until after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes as a result the full extent of our liability under an insurance policy may not be known until many years after the policy is issued changes of this nature may expose us to higher claims than we anticipated when we wrote the underlying policy unexpected increases in our claim costs many years after policies are issued may also result in our inability to recover from certain of our reinsurers the full amount that they would otherwise owe us for such claims costs because certain of the reinsurance agreements covering our business include commutation clauses that permit the reinsurers to terminate their obligations by making a final payment to us based on an estimate of their remaining liabilities in addition the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue to remove limitations on recovery to deem by statute the existence of a covered occurrence to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could be harmful to our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   we may rely on the use of credit scoring in pricing and underwriting certain of our insurance policies and any legal or regulatory requirements that restrict our ability to access credit score information could decrease the accuracy of our pricing and underwriting process and thus decrease our ability to be profitable   we use credit scoring as a factor in pricing and underwriting decisions where allowed by state law consumer groups and regulators have questioned whether the use of credit scoring unfairly discriminates against some groups of people and are calling for laws and regulations to prohibit or restrict the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing laws or regulations that significantly curtail or regulate the use of credit scoring if enacted in a large number of states in which we operate could impact the integrity of our pricing and underwriting process which could in turn materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and make it harder for us to be profitable over time      table of contents assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds secondinjury funds catastrophe funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements for insurers may reduce our profitability   virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insured parties as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies in addition as a condition to the ability to conduct business in various states our insurance subsidiaries must participate in mandatory property and casualty shared market mechanisms or pooling arrangements which provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers the effect of these assessments and mandatory sharedmarket mechanisms or changes in them could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business   the effects of litigation on our business are uncertain and could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and prospects   although we are not currently involved in any material litigation with our clients or insureds other members of the insurance industry are the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts  these lawsuits may have outcomes that are unpredictable this litigation is based on a variety of issues including claim settlement and insurance practices we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be involved in such litigation in the future or what impact such litigation would have on our business   risks related to our common stock   our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate due to the factors beyond our control which could cause the price of our common stock to be volatile   our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “snc”  our performance as well as government regulatory action interest rates and general market conditions could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock  some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock include   · our operating results in any future quarter not meeting the expectations of market analysts or investors   · reductions in our earnings estimates by us or market analysts   · publication of negative research or other unfavorable publicity or speculation in the press or investment community about our company or the insurance industry in general   · increases in interest rates causing investors to demand a higher yield or return on investment than an investment in our common stock may be projected to provide   · changes in market valuations of similar companies   · additions or departures of key personnel   · changes in the economic or regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate   · the occurrence of any of the other risk factors presented in this report and   · general market economic and political conditions      table of contents prior to the completion of the private placement we were treated for federal income tax purposes as a “subchapter s corporation” under the internal revenue code and claims of taxing authorities related to our prior status as an “s” corporation could harm us   upon completion of the private placement in  our parent company’s “s” corporation status terminated and state national became treated as a “c” corporation under “subchapter c” of the income tax provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” which is applicable to most corporations and treats the corporation as an entity that is separate and distinct from its shareholders if the open tax years in which state national was treated as an “s” corporation were audited by the internal revenue service and we are determined not to have qualified for or to have violated our “s” corporation status we will be obligated to pay back taxes interest and penalties and we do not have the right to reclaim tax distributions that we have made to our shareholders during those periods these amounts could include taxes on all of our taxable income while state national was treated as an “s” corporation any such claims could result in additional costs to us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition   we have entered into a tax indemnification agreement with our former “s” corporation shareholders and could become obligated to make payments to them for any additional federal state or local income taxes assessed against them for fiscal periods prior to the completion of the private placement   in the event of an adjustment to our reported taxable income for a period or periods prior to termination of our “s” corporation status persons who held shares of our common stock during the time in which it was treated as an “s” corporation could be liable for additional income taxes for those prior periods therefore prior to the completion of the private placement in  we entered into a tax indemnification agreement with our shareholders who we refer to as our former “s” corporation shareholders pursuant to the tax indemnification agreement we will pay each such shareholder on an aftertax or grossedup basis the amount of additional income taxes plus interest and penalties due as a result of adjustments pursuant to a determination by or a settlement with a taxing authority or court or pursuant to the filing of an amended tax return to the taxable income of our parent company with respect to taxable periods during which it filed as an “s” corporation the payments we could be required to make will be reduced by certain tax benefits that may be available to our former “s” corporation shareholders as a result of such adjustments such payments will also include any reasonable outofpocket expenses incurred by the former “s” corporation shareholders arising out of a claim for such tax liability   compliance with the laws rules and regulations of being a public company requires significant company resources and management attention   as a public company with listed equity securities we need to comply with laws regulations and requirements certain corporate governance provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of  “sarbanesoxley” periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act and other regulations of the sec and the requirements of the nasdaq global select market with which we were not required to comply as a private company  complying with these laws rules and regulations requires us to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses  these efforts require a significant amount of time from our board of directors and management possibly diverting their attention from the implementation of our business plan and growth strategy   we have made and will continue to make changes to our corporate governance standards disclosure controls financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our obligations as a public company  we cannot assure you that the changes we have made and will continue to make to satisfy our obligations as a public company will be successful and any failure on our part to satisfy these obligations could subject us to delisting of our common stock fines sanctions and other regulatory action and potential litigation   failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price   section  of sarbanesoxley and the related rules and regulations of the sec require an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our    table of contents internal control over financial reporting as such standards are modified supplemented or amended from time to time we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section  of sarbanesoxley and the related rules and regulations of the sec if we cannot in the future favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock   as an “emerging growth company” our shareholders likely will not have the benefit of certain protective provisions that would otherwise apply to most public companies   the jumpstart our business startups “jobs” act became law in   the jobs act “ipo onramp” provisions provide that companies with less than  billion of total annual gross revenues “emerging growth companies” will be exempted from certain disclosure requirements for up to five years following their initial public offerings  an emerging growth company is subject to reduced disclosure requirements during this period including   · fewer years of required financial statements in its registration statement two years compared to three years by nonemerging growth companies   · no requirement to present selected financial data for periods preceding the earliest audited period required to be presented in the registration statement for a company’s initial public offering   · exemption from the requirements under section b of the sarbanesoxley act for auditor attestation relating to internal control over financial reporting   · grandfather provisions allowing a company to forgo compliance with new or revised financial statement or auditing requirements and   · reduced executive compensation disclosure including reduction of the number of executive officers whose compensation is required to be described fewer years of required disclosure exemption from the requirement to include a compensation disclosure and analysis section and exemption from certain provisions of the doddfrank act relating to “sayonpay” “payforperformance” comparative pay and golden parachutes   as a result our shareholders likely will not have the benefit of certain protective provisions and additional disclosures that would otherwise apply to most public companies  unless earlier terminated our status as an emerging growth company will end on december     future sales and issuances of shares of our capital stock may depress our share price   we may in the future issue our previously authorized and unissued securities we have an authorized capitalization of  million shares of our common stock and  million shares of preferred stock with such designations preferences and rights as are contained in our charter or bylaws and as determined by our board of directors issuances of stock may result in dilution of our existing shareholders or a decrease in the per share price of our common stock it is not possible to state the actual effect of the issuance of any shares of our preferred stock on the rights of holders of our common stock until our board of directors determines the specific rights attached to that class or series of preferred stock   we cannot predict what effect if any future sales of our common stock or the availability of shares for future sale will have on the price prospective buyers are willing to pay for our common stock sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by us or our shareholders or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the price prospective buyers are willing to pay for our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your shares at a time and price that you determine appropriate see “shares available for future sale” for further information regarding circumstances under which additional shares of our common stock may be sold      table of contents provisions contained in our organizational documents as well as provisions of delaware law contractual agreements and compensation arrangements could delay or prevent a change of control of us which could adversely affect the price of shares of our common stock   our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions that   · provide that special meetings of our shareholders generally can only be called by the chairman of the board of directors the chief executive officer the president or by a resolution approved by our board of directors   · provide our board of directors the ability to issue undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without shareholder approval and which may grant preferred holders super voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holder of common stock   · eliminate the ability of shareholders to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting   · provide our board of directors the ability to issue common stock and warrants within the amount of authorized capital and   · provide that shareholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of shareholders generally must provide timely advance notice of their intent in writing and certain other information not less than  days nor more than  days prior to the oneyear anniversary of the date of the preceding year’s annual meeting of shareholders   in addition some of our agreements such as our alliance agreement with cuna mutual our standard reinsurance agreements and some of our incentive plans contain change of control provisions  in addition we have certain severance agreements with executives that provide for payments following a change of control   the provisions discussed above alone or together could delay hostile takeovers and changes of control of our company or changes in our management even if such transactions would be beneficial to our shareholders   as a delaware corporation we will also be subject to antitakeover provisions of delaware law the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” provides that shareholders are not entitled to cumulative voting rights in the election of directors unless a corporation’s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise our certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors   in addition we are subject to section  of the dgcl which subject to certain exceptions prohibits a public delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination as defined in such section with an “interested shareholder” defined generally as any person who beneficially owns  or more of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation or any person affiliated with such person for a period of three years following the time that such shareholder became an interested shareholder unless  prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder  upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder the interested shareholder owned at least  of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested shareholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or  on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested shareholder      table of contents any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock see “description of capital stock—certain antitakeover effects of provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law”   applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company   state insurance holding company laws require prior approval by the respective state insurance departments of any change of control of an insurer “control” is generally defined as the possession direct or indirect of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the company whether through the ownership of voting securities by contract or otherwise control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of  or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company any person wishing to acquire control of us or of any substantial portion of our outstanding shares would first be required to obtain the approval of the domestic regulators including those asserting “commercial domicile” of our insurance subsidiaries or file appropriate disclaimers   these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay deter or prevent a change of control of us including through transactions and in particular unsolicited transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable  see “regulation—holding company regulation—change of control”   future issuance of debt or preferred stock which would rank senior to our common stock upon our liquidation and future offerings of equity securities which would dilute our existing shareholders may adversely affect the market value of our common stock   in the future we may attempt to increase our capital resources by issuing debt or making additional offerings of equity securities including bank debt commercial paper mediumterm notes senior or subordinated notes and classes of shares of preferred stock upon liquidation holders of our debt securities and preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of shares of our common stock additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market value of our common stock or both our preferred stock if issued could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that would limit amounts available for distribution to holders of shares of our common stock because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future offerings thus holders of shares of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market value of our common stock

such the cpi premiums written are those that we expect to earn which we refer to as “stick premiums” while those that are expected to cancel are included in the allowance for policy cancellations    ceding fees are fees we receive in the program services segment in exchange for providing access to the us property and casualty insurance market and are based on the gross premiums we write on behalf of our ga and capacity provider clients we earn ceding fees in a manner consistent with the recognition of the gross earned premium on the underlying insurance policies generally on a prorata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured  typically the reinsured policies have a term of one year  minimum capacity fees which are determined based on the shortfall if any between the program’s contractual annual premium minimum and the amount of premium that we estimate will be written in the contract year are earned over the contract year  see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation—principal revenue and expense items—minimum ceding fees”  ceding commissions earned on lender services business are not included as ceding fees  cuna mutual’s ceding commission is included as a partial offset to commission expense    upon the completion of the private placement in  our parent company’s status as a subchapter s corporation terminated and our consolidated income became fully subject to us federal income taxes  this adjustment represents estimated income taxes as if the company had been treated as a c corporation for each period presented  the estimated tax was calculated assuming the company’s blended statutory federal and state income tax rates of   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively    as a result of the company’s conversion to a c corporation the deferred tax asset increased by approximately  million primarily due to the effects of eliminating deferred tax balances on the insurance subsidiaries related to intercompany transactions    prior to the completion of the private placement in june  we made special compensation payments to our cofounders in recognition of their service to our company  we refer to these payments as “founder special compensation”  following the completion of the private placement in  we ceased paying founder special compensation    in connection with the  amendment to the alliance agreement with cuna mutual we paid cuna mutual  million    represents the tax effect of nongaap expense adjustments for founder special compensation offeringrelated expenses and contract modification expense for each period presented  the estimated tax was calculated assuming the company’s blended statutory federal and state income tax rates of   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively    adjusted net income is considered a nongaap financial measure because it reflects the following adjustments to net income which is the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap the pro forma provision for income taxes as if the company had been treated as a c corporation for each period presented and the exclusion net of tax benefit of the increase in the company’s deferred tax asset as a result of the conversion to c corporation status the amount of founder special compensation and the nonrecurring infrequent or unusual offeringrelated expenses and contract modification expense related to the amendment to our alliance agreement with cuna mutual  management believes this measure is helpful to investors because it provides comparability in evaluating core financial performance between periods before and after the completion of our private placement in june   management uses adjusted net income to evaluate core financial performance against historical results without the effect of these items    our reinsurance recoverables are based on estimates and our actual liabilities may exceed the amount that we are able to recover from our reinsurers or any collateral securing the liabilities this could occur because the loss    table of contents experience based on the policy terms is higher than expected or due to litigation regulatory or other extracontractual liabilities  our insurance subsidiaries remain liable for unearned premiums and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reinsurance ceded should the reinsurer be unable to meet its obligations management considers the possibility of a reinsurer becoming unable to meet its obligations as remote due to the reinsurers’

allowance for policy cancellations is provided for the estimated amount of return premiums and policy fees net of commission expense and premium taxes that will be incurred on expected future policy cancellations associated with the company’s cpi business premiums and cancellation data are accumulated by accounting month month in which the premium was writtencollected lending institution and at the corporate level  the estimation methodology utilizes actual cancellation rates premium refunds divided by premiums written by accounting month to determine expected future cancellations for that accounting month the estimate for each accounting month decreases each subsequent month as actual refunds emerge  while management believes the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are adequate such estimates may be more or less than the amounts ultimately refunded the estimates are reviewed quarterly by management and any changes are reflected in current operations   item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   forwardlooking and other statements   this discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of  that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected see “note on forwardlooking statements” in part i of this report   overview   we are a leading specialty provider of property and casualty insurance services operating in two niche markets across the united states  in our program services segment we leverage our “a” excellent am best rating expansive licenses and reputation to provide access to the us property and casualty insurance market in exchange for ceding fees  in our lender services segment we specialize in providing collateral protection insurance “cpi” which insures personal automobiles and other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions banks and specialty finance companies   our program services segment generates significant fee income in the form of ceding fees by offering issuing carrier “fronting” capacity to both specialty general agents and other producers “gas” who sell control and administer books of insurance business that are supported by third parties that assume reinsurance risk  these reinsurers are domestic and foreign insurers and institutional risk investors “capacity providers” that want to access specific lines of us property and casualty insurance business  issuing carrier arrangements refer to our business in which we write insurance on behalf of a capacity provider and then reinsure the risk under these policies with the capacity provider in exchange for ceding fees  we reinsure substantially all of the underwriting risks in connection with our fronting arrangements to our capacity providers as such this segment generates very large gross premiums with no net    table of contents premiums except for the runoff of the retained business as described below in many cases we hold significant collateral to secure the associated reinsurance recoverables furthermore to the extent funds related to settling balances premiums commissions and losses between the gas and the reinsurers are not the obligation of the company no receivables or payables are reflected in the company’s financial statements for these amounts in exchange for providing our insurance capacity licensing and rating to our ga and insurer clients we receive ceding fees averaging in excess of  of gross written premiums   our lender services segment generates premiums primarily from providing collateral protection insurance or cpi to our credit union bank and specialty finance company clients  lenders purchase cpi to provide coverage for automobiles or other vehicles of borrowers who do not uphold their obligation to insure the collateral underlying the loan our lender clients pay us directly for cpi and then add the cost of cpi to the borrower’s loan our cpi business is fully vertically integrated we manage all aspects of the cpi business cycle including sales and marketing policy issuance policy administration underwriting and claims handling   recent developments   effective january   the company acquired  of the outstanding common shares of fireman’s fund insurance company of ohio an excess and surplus lines or nonadmitted shell company  the company was subsequently renamed independent specialty insurance company “isic”  the purpose of these acquisitions is to provide exclusive capacity for one of our programs factors affecting our operating results   trending market opportunities  we believe that macroeconomic conditions will provide us with growth opportunities in each of our business segments  increasing automobile sales should expand lenders’ loan portfolios to improve our lender services results  over the past decade alternative capital has been entering the reinsurance market at an accelerating pace  this influx of capital has had the effect of compressing rates for reinsurance which in the past was primarily written to reinsure catastropheexposed property insurance  these lower reinsurance rates are now driving industry capital to seek opportunity in us primary insurance markets for both property and casualty lines  these market dynamics should provide growth opportunities in our program services segment   in our lender services business we believe that organic growth from our existing lender clients will be driven by overall growth in lenders’ portfolios as a result of rising automobile sales higher average auto loan balances and an aging us automobile fleet  we also expect that new sales from our alliance with cuna mutual will produce additional premiums   we believe that the increased role of capital market alternatives to reinsurance including the capitalization of hedge fundbacked reinsurers and the availability of capital in the nonus reinsurance market is driving demand for our program services as these firms typically do not have direct access to the us insurance market  we are well positioned to meet this demand due to our highly rated and broadly licensed insurance subsidiaries in addition to our proven model to provide fronting for a fee   we currently have a significant program with nephila capital ltd “nephila” under which we granted nephila the exclusive right to utilize the company as issuing carrier for us catastrophe exposed property insurance from  through   nephila is a hedge fund with approximately  billion in assets under management that participates in the market for catastrophe exposed property business  in exchange for this exclusive right nephila has agreed to pay state national contractual minimum ceding fees totaling  million for  through  the minimum ceding fees are subject to state national maintaining its “a” am best rating and potential reductions to the extent that state national is unable to provide production year capacity or is otherwise constrained from writing premium  also under certain circumstances nephila may terminate the exclusivity which would reduce the contractual minimum ceding fees to a total of  million for  through   in the event of such a termination state national would have the ability to write the catastrophe exposed property business for other capacity providers  the timing and actual amount of gross premiums written for nephila will impact the timing and amount of ceding fees earned each period under this program  see “—principal revenue and expense items—minimum ceding fees”  in addition state national and    table of contents nephila have an alliance under which state national acquired city national insurance company “cnic” an admitted property and casualty insurance shell company and isic a nonadmitted property and casualty insurance shell company which will be used exclusively to write business produced by nephila  nephila will have a three year option to purchase these companies beginning three years after the shell companies first write premium in the event that the option is exercised contractual minimum payments to state national will extend for an additional two years   alliance with cuna mutual   the company’s alliance with cuna mutual that began in  provides us access to a wider array of clients and added significant additional scale to our cpi business  for the years ended december    and  we have generated net premiums earned of  million  million and  million respectively through the alliance with cuna mutual prior to july   this business was subject to a  quota share agreement with cuna mutual  effective july   we amended the alliance agreement to increase our retention of the business subject to the alliance to  in exchange for payments made to cuna mutual totaling  million  the company’s net premiums earned increased  million  million and  million related to the amendment of the alliance agreement for the years ended december    and  respectively  in addition the term of the alliance has been extended at least through july     runoff of the retained business   in the past the company has participated to a limited extent on a quota share basis in certain programs in the program services segment  from  until  california had required usic to retain  of the risks written  after this requirement was lifted in early  the company reinsured to inception the retained business under most of the active contracts but others continue to runoff  the company has no active retained contracts and has no present intention of participating in future contracts  we refer to this business as “the runoff of the retained business”  as of december   we had net reserves of  million related to this business   subchapter s corporation status   prior to the completion of the private placement in  we elected for our parent company to be taxed for federal income tax purposes as a “subchapter s corporation” under the internal revenue code and our subsidiaries other than our insurance subsidiaries and intermediate holding company to be passthrough entities for federal income tax purposes as a result prior to the completion of the private placement the income for our parent company and passthrough subsidiaries was not subject to and we did not pay us federal income taxes and no provision or liability for federal or state income tax for our parent company and passthrough subsidiaries has been included in our consolidated financial statements  the tax provision assets and liabilities that are reflected in our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the completion of the private placement represent those for our insurance subsidiaries and their intermediate holding company state national intermediate holdings inc “snih” as those entities were “c” corporations  despite the subchapter s corporation status the impact of taxes on our parent company are included in the financial statements in that our shareholders were provided with the cash to pay the taxes that passed through to the shareholders  prior to the completion of the private placement we made periodic cash distributions to our shareholders that have included amounts necessary for them to pay their estimated personal us federal income tax liabilities relating to the items of our income gain deductions and losses that pass through to them  upon the completion of the private placement our parent company’s status as a subchapter s corporation terminated and our parent company became a “c” corporation for us tax purposes and became subject to a combined federal and state corporate income tax rate between  and  we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in taxexempt municipal securities which investment may have the effect of lowering our effective tax rate   founder special compensation   prior to the completion of the private placement in  we paid special compensation to our cofounders in recognition of their service to our company  we refer to these payments as “founder special compensation”  founder special compensation payments were discretionary and determined by the company’s owners in the first or second quarter of the year in which they were made based on current period considerations including capital position estimated capital needs and liquidity and earnings for the prior year  we paid founder special compensation in the aggregate amount of  million for the year ended december    following the completion of the private placement in  we ceased paying founder special compensation   seasonality of our business   our lender services segment typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in written premium  the fourth quarter tends to generate the greatest amount of written premium whereas the first quarter of the year tends to generate the least  we believe this trend follows loan delinquency patterns for the industry we generally do not experience seasonality in our program services segment    table of contents   principal revenue and expense items   premiums earned  premiums earned are the earned portion of our net premiums written which are predominately cpi premiums as the cpi product is not a traditional insurance product the premium recognition is likewise different  we do not record premiums until we collect them from our accounts since they have the right to waive the placement of insurance on any of their loans  there is a high level of policy cancellations since borrowers often purchase insurance at the traditional rates that provides protection for them in addition to their lender  due to this high level of policy cancellations we split the premium into two pieces  an allowance for future cancellations and  premiums that we expect to earn which we refer to as “stick premiums”  we earn stick premiums on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies the cpi premiums written as presented in this document reflect the effects of the allowance for policy cancellations including any adjustments related to reestimation of the allowance  as such our recorded cpi premiums written are those that we expect to earn while those that are expected to cancel are included in the allowance for policy cancellations  at the end of each reporting period stick premium written that is not earned is classified as unearned premium which is earned in subsequent periods over the remaining terms of the policies our policies typically have a term of one year although the average duration of our cpi policies is typically less than six months due to policy cancellations   ceding fees  ceding fees are fees we receive in the program services segment in exchange for providing access to the us property and casualty insurance market and are based on the gross premiums we write on behalf of our ga and capacity provider clients we earn ceding fees in a manner consistent with the recognition of the gross premiums earned on the underlying insurance policies generally on a prorata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured which policies often have a one year term   minimum ceding fees  minimum ceding fees are fees we receive pursuant to contractual minimum premium requirements for certain of our programs where either significant premium capacity is reserved for that program or where the expected premium volume is not reasonably assured  for those programs where a minimum applies the ceding fees are considered as two distinct pieces  “premiumrelated fees” which are earned as the associated gross written premium is earned typically pro rata on an annual basis and  “capacity fees” which are determined based on the shortfall if any between the program’s contractual annual premium minimum and the amount of premium that we estimate will be written in the contract year which fees are earned over the contract year   at the end of each quarter during the program contract year we adjust the capacity fee based upon the reestimated or actual amount of gross premiums that we expect will be written or that were written for that program for the full contract year  if the estimated annual gross written premiums fall below the minimum contract level in a given period capacity fees associated with the estimated premium shortfall for that period are earned in that period  if the estimated annual gross written premiums equal or exceed the required minimum level for a given period no capacity fees are recognized for that period and the premiumrelated fees are earned as the associated gross written premium is earned  in connection with our reestimation process if in a subsequent period we increase our estimate of the amount of gross premiums that we expect will be written under a program for the full contract year we will reverse a portion of the capacity fees earned in a prior period  conversely to the extent that we decrease our estimate of gross premiums we will recognize capacity fees associated with the additional shortfall in the current period   losses and loss adjustment expenses  losses and loss adjustment expenses “lae” include claims paid estimates of future claim payments changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating defending and servicing claims we record loss and lae related to estimates of future claim payments based on historical experience we seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on our historical claims experience we revise our estimates as we receive additional information about claims and the total costs of settlement   commissions  substantially all commission expenses are related to our lender services segment  a significant portion of these amounts are paid to financial institutions as a means to reimburse the financial institution for costs associated with operating a cpi program these commissions are partially offset by a  ceding commission received under our quota reinsurance agreement with cuna mutual and the reimbursement we received from cuna mutual for  of direct commissions and other reimbursable expenses paid to accounts  the ceding commission compensates us    table of contents for expenses such as underwriting and policy acquisition expenses that we incur in connection with the writing of the ceded business   general and administrative expense  general and administrative expense is composed of all other operating expenses including various departmental salaries and benefits expense for employees  general and administrative expense also includes expenses related to our office space postage telephone and information technology charges as well as legal and auditing fees and corporate travel  in addition general and administrative expense includes those charges that are related to the amortization of tangible and intangible assets   stockbased compensation expense  compensation expense for stockbased payments is recognized based on the measurementdate fair value for awards that will settle in shares  compensation expense for restricted stock grants and stock option awards that contain a service condition are recognized on a straight line pro rata basis over the vesting period  for restricted stock awards that contain a performance condition the expense is recognized based on the awards expected to vest and the cumulative expense is adjusted whenever the estimate of the number of awards to vest changes   other measures and ratios   nongaap measures   adjusted pretax income   our financial statements are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap”  adjusted pretax income is considered a nongaap financial measure because it reflects adjustments to pretax income which is the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap for the amount of founder special compensation and the nonrecurring offeringrelated expenses and contract modification expense related to the amendment to our alliance with cuna mutual as applicable  the company’s management “management” believes this measure is helpful to investors because it provides comparability in evaluating core financial performance between periods before and after the completion of our private placement in june   management uses adjusted pretax income to evaluate core financial performance against historical results without the effect of these items   adjusted net income   adjusted net income is considered a nongaap financial measure because it reflects adjustments to net income which is the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap for the pro forma provision for income taxes as if the company had been treated as a c corporation for each period presented and the exclusion of the increase in the company’s deferred tax asset as a result of the conversion to the c corporation status for the amount of founder special compensation and the nonrecurring offeringrelated expenses and contract modification expense related to the amendment to our alliance with cuna mutual as applicable  management believes this measure is helpful to investors because it provides comparability in evaluating core financial performance between periods before and after the completion of our private placement in june   management uses adjusted net income to evaluate core financial performance against historical results without the effect of these items   for a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation—results of operations—consolidated results of operations”  these adjustments to the gaap measures are only applicable to  and prior periods   program services ratios   gross leverage  gross leverage for the company is the ratio of gross written premiums and gross liabilities to surplus  a significant portion of our capital is used to support the gross premium and insurance liabilities in our program services segment because we retain virtually no risk other than the credit risk of the capacity providers and we maintain strict credit underwriting standards broad indemnification agreements and collateral requirements we are able to maintain significant ceded reinsurance business on a relatively small amount of capital compared to our peers  for the year ended december   our gross leverage ratio was  to   our objective is to produce a total company gross leverage ratio of between  to  and  to       table of contents lender services insurance ratios   net loss ratio   the net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of our lender services segment  expressed as a percentage this is the ratio of net losses and lae incurred to net premiums earned for the years ended december    and  our net loss ratio was   and  respectively  this decrease is primarily due to an increase in premiums earned resulting in part from active account management on our cpi product   net expense ratio   the net expense ratio is a component of our operational efficiency in administering our lender services segment expressed as a percentage this is the ratio of net expenses commissions taxes licenses and fees and general and administrative to net premiums earned  our expense ratio is higher than that for most traditional insurance products due to the labor and systems intensive processes involved in monitoring the insurance statuses for the loan portfolios of our lender services clients  for the years ended december    and  our net expense ratio was   and  respectively   net combined ratio   the net combined ratio is a measure of the overall profitability of our lender services segment  this is the sum of the net loss ratio and the net expense ratio for the years ended december    and  our net combined ratio was   and  respectively  our objective is to price our products to achieve a net combined ratio between  to    financial ratios   return on equity one of the key financial measures that we use to evaluate our operating performance is return on equity we calculate return on equity by dividing net income by the average gaap equity our return on equity at december   was   our overall financial objective is to produce a return on equity of at least  over the longterm   financial leverage ratio our financial leverage ratio at december   was  as compared to  at december   our objective is to maintain a financial leverage ratio in the range of  to  over the longterm   critical accounting estimates   our consolidated financial statements include amounts that either by their nature or due to the requirements of gaap are determined using estimates and assumptions  we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  while we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented  we believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are unpaid losses and lae reserves allowance for policy cancellations unearned premium reserve reinsurance recoverable valuation of our investment portfolio assessment of otherthantemporary impairments “otti” and minimum ceding fees   we believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our consolidated financial statements  the following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts  for a complete summary of our significant accounting policies see the notes to the consolidated financial statements   unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses   the liability for unpaid losses and lae includes an estimate for claims reported and an additional liability for claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries  estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as economic legal and social conditions  loss reserves are not discounted to present value which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income      table of contents in establishing these estimates we make various assumptions regarding a number of factors including frequency and severity of claims the length of time needed to achieve ultimate settlement of claims inflation of medical costs insurance policy coverage interpretations jury determinations and legislative changes due to the inherent uncertainty associated with these estimates and the cost of incurred but unreported claims our actual liabilities may be different from our original estimates  on a quarterly basis we review our reserves for losses and lae to determine whether further adjustments are required any resulting adjustments are included in the current period’s results  additional information regarding the judgments and uncertainties surrounding our estimated reserves for losses and lae can be found in “business—loss reserves” in item  of this report   allowance for policy cancellations   an allowance for policy cancellations is provided for the estimated amount of return premiums and policy fees net of commission expense and premium taxes that will be incurred on expected future policy cancellations associated with the company’s business premiums and cancellation data are accumulated by accounting month month in which the premium was writtencollected  the estimation methodology utilizes actual cancellation rates premium refunds divided by premiums written by accounting month to determine expected future cancellations for that accounting month the balance for each accounting month decreases each subsequent month as actual refunds emerge   while management believes the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are adequate such estimates may be more or less than the amounts ultimately refunded the estimates are continually reviewed by management and any changes are reflected in current operations   unearned premium   unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies  the lender

claims reported and an additional liability for claims incurred but not reported based on the company’s historical loss experience while management believes the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are adequate such estimates may be more or less than the amount ultimately paid when the claims are settled these estimates are reviewed and adjusted on a continuing basis as necessary as experience develops or as new information becomes known and such adjustments are included in current operations  the recoverable for ceded premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies  the lender services segment calculates this reserve after adjusting for anticipated policy cancellations   investments   investments are considered availableforsale and are carried at fair value the company measures the fair value of the investments based upon quoted market prices from an independent pricing service and its thirdparty investment managers using observable market information the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method unrealized gains and losses associated with the availableforsale portfolio as a result of temporary changes in fair value during the period such investments are held are reflected net of income taxes and reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders’ equity unrealized losses associated with the availableforsale portfolio that are deemed to be otherthantemporary are charged to income in the period in which the otherthantemporary impairment is determined debt security premiums and discounts are amortized into earnings using the effectiveinterest method   the company evaluates its investment portfolio for impairments of individual securities that are deemed to be otherthantemporary fixed maturity securities that are determined to have otherthantemporary impairment and it is more likely than not the company will sell before recovery of their amortized cost are written down to fair value and the entire amount of the writedown is included in net income net of realized investment gains for all other impaired fixed    table of contents maturity securities the impairment loss is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount representing all other factors the amount of impairment loss that represents the credit loss is included in net income net of realized investment gains the amount of the impairment loss that relates to all other factors is included in other comprehensive income equity securities that are determined to have otherthantemporary impairment are recognized in net income net of realized investment gains   the process for identifying otherthantemporary declines in fair value involves the consideration of several factors including but not limited to whether the issuer has been downgraded to below investmentgrade the length of time in which there has been a significant decline in value the liquidity and overall financial condition of the issuer the nature and performance of the collateral or other credit support backing the security the significance of the decline in value and whether the company has the intent to sell the security or may be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery the company reviews securities for otherthantemporary impairment internally and with its investment advisors   the company invests in convertible securities that have embedded derivatives  derivatives embedded within nonderivative instruments such as options embedded in convertible fixed maturity securities are bifurcated from the host instrument when the embedded derivative meets the criteria for bifurcation  however for reporting purposes these embedded derivatives are presented together with the host contract and carried at estimated fair value  changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are reflected in “realized net investment gains” in the consolidated statements of income while changes in the estimated fair value of the underlying fixed maturity securities are reflected in “unrealized holding gains losses” in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income minimum ceding fees   minimum ceding fees are fees the company receives pursuant to contractual minimum premium requirements for certain programs where either significant premium capacity is reserved for that program or where the expected premium volume is not reasonably assured  for those programs where a minimum applies the ceding fees are considered as two distinct pieces   “premiumrelated fees” which are earned as the associated gross written premium is earned typically pro rata on an annual basis and  “capacity fees” which are determined based on the shortfall if any between the program’s contractual annual premium minimum and the amount of premium estimated to be written in the contract year which fees are earned over the contract year minimum ceding fees earned are based on estimates of annual premiums to be written for those programs that are subject to a minimum premium levels and related ceding fees  these estimates are based upon various assumptions made regarding the production plans for the underlying program  these assumptions are reviewed by management and the amount of annual premiums expected to be written are reestimated each quarter  as actual premiums emerge and revisions are made to earlier estimates minimum ceding fees are earned or reversed

all we may be unable to support future growth or operating requirements and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected  we may generate liquidity through the issuance of debt or equity securities or financing through borrowings under credit facilities or a combination thereof   our insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions imposed on insurance companies by their states of domicile which limit the amount of cash dividends or distributions that they may pay to us unless special permission is received from the insurance regulator of the relevant domiciliary state the aggregate limit imposed by the various domiciliary states of our insurance subsidiaries was approximately  million and  million as of december   and  respectively in addition we are able to generate substantial cash flow outside of our regulated insurance company subsidiaries through intercompany agency and management agreements between our insurance subsidiaries and our agency tba tba functions as a managing general agent for snic nsic and usic in connection with the lender services segment  in addition under the management agreement tba provides business development financial monitoring and other oversight functions to our insurance subsidiaries   the following table is a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows                             year ended       december     in thousands                                  cash and cash equivalents provided by used in

and    net cash provided by operating activities was  million higher for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in lender services and program services operating results   net cash used in in investing activities decreased  million for year ended december   to the year ended december   primarily due to the liquidation of investments related to the acquisition of cnic and acquisition of isic in january   these decreases were largely offset by the purchase of cnic on september   in the amount of  million   net cash used in financing activities increased  million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the settlement of  million in stock repurchases in    comparison of years ended december   and    net cash provided by operating activities was  million higher for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december    the increase is primarily due to nonrecurring cash expenditures for the year ended december   related to founder special compensation amendment to the cuna mutual alliance agreement and offeringrelated expenses  also contributing to the increase is an increase in ceding fees and the change to the company’s retention related to the cuna mutual alliance agreement to  from    net cash used in in investing activities decreased  million from  million for year ended december   to  million for the year ended december    this decrease is primarily due to investing cash received from the private placement in    net cash from financing activities decreased  million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december    the decrease is primarily due to proceeds of  million received from the private    table of contents placement in   other activity impacting cashflows was a decrease in dividends paid of  million  million stock repurchase in  and  million subordinated debenture repurchase in    other material changes in

liabilities               accounts receivable from agents net  this balance reflects ceding fees premiums and premium taxes receivable during the year ending december   accounts receivable from agents increased  million from december   primarily as a result of an increase in program services receivables  the increase primarily relates to one of our arrangements under which we are responsible to certain reinsurers for the collection and payment of premiums  as a result the related premiums receivable and payable are reflected in our balance sheet  the remainder partially relates to an agreement with nephila we entered into effective january    for nephila we will at nephila’s request transfer certain exposures that are otherwise reinsured by nephila’s quota share reinsurer to excess reinsurers  in instances where this agreement is utilized state national enters into an agreement directly with excess reinsurers and nephila guarantees the obligation of those excess reinsurers and pays the premiums on our behalf on a quarterly basis in arrears  we purchased one excess reinsurance policy under this agreement during    goodwill and intangible assets net    as of december   goodwill and intangible assets increased  million compared to december   primarily due to an increase in indefinitelived intangible assets of  million related to the cnic acquisition   deferred income taxes net deferred income taxes net increased  million compared to december   primarily due to increases in deferred ceding fees and the allowance for policy cancellations related to growth in program services and lender services revenues   reinsurance recoverables unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums    as of december   we held  billion in collateral securing  billion in reinsurance recoverables  the remaining unsecured reinsurance recoverables of  are ceded to highlyrated well capitalized reinsurers  during the year ended december   reinsurance recoverables increased  million from december   which was primarily a result of the increase in gross premiums written for program services business due to the addition of new programs and expansion of existing programs and gross loss development for prior year claims  these factors also caused an increase in the corresponding unearned premiums and the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of  million and  million respectively   allowance for policy cancellations  as of december   the allowance for policy cancellations increased by  million from december   primarily due to the volume and timing of cpi premiums gross of cancellations written in  compared to   the fourth quarter tends to generate the greatest amount of written premium whereas the first quarter of the year tends to generate the least  on a quarterly basis we review our estimates for allowance for policy cancellations to determine whether further adjustments are appropriate  any resulting adjustments are included in    table of contents the current period’s operating results  the allowance for policy cancellations for the year ended december   and december   included upward revisions to prior year estimates of  million and  million respectively  because of the interplay between the allowance for policy cancellations and the related unearned premium reserve changes in the allowance for policy cancellations are partially offset by related changes in the unearned premium reserve and amounts ceded to reinsurers  after taking into account the associated changes in unearned premium and amounts ceded to reinsurers the net impact to the balance sheet and the corresponding reduction in net income from the revised estimates for the year ended december   and  was approximately  million and  million respectively   capital resources   the company has three statutory business trusts that were formed between  and  for the sole purpose of issuing  million of trust preferred securities in private offering transactions  the trusts used the proceeds from these offerings together with the equity proceeds received upon their initial formation from tba an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of state national to purchase variablerate subordinated debentures issued by tba  all voting securities of the trusts are owned by tba and the debentures are the sole assets of the trusts  the trusts meet the obligations of the trust preferred securities with the interest and principal paid on the debentures  these trusts’ interest rates range from  to  plus the threemonth libor  the threemonth libor at december   was   all of the debentures mature between  and    on march   the company through tba entered into a loan agreement which provides for a secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of  million  the credit agreement matures on april    under the credit agreement tba may request advances up to the aggregate amount of the unused commitment under the credit facility on a revolving basis prior to the maturity of the credit agreement  borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus  per annum provided however that libor shall be subject to a floor of   tba shall also pay a commitment fee on the daily average unused commitment amount for the period running from the closing date to the maturity date at a rate of  per annum  the credit agreement contains customary representations warranties covenants and events of default as well as a financial covenant requiring tba and the company to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of at least  million     contractual obligations and commitments   the following table sets forth certain of our contractual obligations as of december                                          in thousands        total        less than  year         years         years        more than  years   loss and lae                        operating lease obligations                          —   employment agreement obligations                            debt and interest                                                      the loss and lae payments due by period in the table above are based upon the loss and lae estimates as of december   and actuarial estimates of expected payout patterns and are not contractual liabilities with finite maturities our contractual liability is to provide benefits under the policy as a result our calculation of loss and lae payments due by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of loss and lae generally and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid for a discussion of our loss and lae estimation process see “business—loss reserves” in item  of this report  actual payments of loss and lae by period will vary perhaps materially from the table above to the extent that current estimates of loss and lae vary from actual ultimate claims amounts and as a result of variations between expected and actual payout patterns see “risk factors—risks relating to our business—if we are unable to establish and maintain accurate loss reserves our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected” in item    table of contents a of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties associated with estimating loss and lae  the interest related to the debt by period as of december   was as follows  million—less than  year  million— –  years  million— –  years and   million—more than  years    item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   liquidity risk   liquidity risk represents our potential inability to meet all payment obligations when they become due we maintain sufficient cash and marketable securities to fund claim payments and operations   credit risk   we are exposed to credit risk from potential losses arising principally from the financial condition of our third party reinsurers and also from potential losses in our investment portfolio  although our third party reinsurers are obligated to reimburse us to the extent we cede risk to them we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have ceded as a result reinsurance contracts do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims covered under the insurance policies we issue and we might not collect amounts recoverable from our reinsurers we generally address this credit risk by either  selecting reinsurers that have an am best rating of “a” excellent or better have  million in equity andor capital and surplus and are a texas or delaware for usic authorized reinsurer at the time we enter into the agreement or  requiring that the reinsurer post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks  security can take the form of collateral in the form of security posted with a trustee pursuant to a related agreement or evergreen letter of credit or guaranty by a related third party that we believe has the ability to pay  the security amount is a function of the policyholder liabilities unearned premiums losses and lae reserves or other amounts that are more representative of the amounts at risk excess security is required when a reinsurer does not meet the above financial requirements to provide a “cushion” for inadequate estimates of policyholder liabilities  unless there is some mitigating factor we control the ability to set policyholder liability amounts for security purposes   security is also immediately required if a reinsurer falls below the benchmark rating during the term of a reinsurance agreement existing security may be increased if a reinsurer is downgraded during the term of a reinsurance agreement or experiences a significant loss in policyholder equity andor capital and surplus   collateral levels are reviewed weekly on each reinsurer on which security is required collateral calculations are adjusted as monthly activity reports are received on individual programs and collateral account balance information is available  collateral is generally obtained a quarter in advance at the end of each calendar quarter   we also evaluate the credit risk of our investment portfolio the primary measure we utilize to mitigate credit risk the risk of principal default on the securities we invested in involves the credit quality of our portfolio  approximately  of our portfolio is rated aa or higher rated by standard  poor’s which is consistent with the guidelines provided to our asset managers  additionally our investment committee reviews the portfolio on a quarterly basis and discusses any securities which have been downgraded in the previous quarter   market risk   the risk of underperformance in the market is addressed by having a quality asset manager administering our portfolio  additionally our portfolio is diversified to eliminate exposure to any one particular segment  finally as the bulk of our assets support either our surplus or short tailed lines of business investment performance is a relatively small portion of our profits relative to other property and casualty companies   our investment policy is reviewed periodically and updated to meet current needs however the primary goal and philosophy of the policy is to be conservative in nature to provide preservation of principal and provide necessary liquidity      table of contents interest rate risk   this is a twofold risk involving loss of market value due to a rising interest rate environment coupled with a need to liquidate those securities to provide liquidity for operations  our exposure to extreme shifts in interest rates is mitigated to some extent by selecting a duration target for the portfolio which is relatively short ie approximately four years  the exposure to actually selling underwater securities to gain liquidity is managed by maintaining a laddered portfolio whereby we have securities maturing over the next few years  further mitigation is provided by maintaining the convexity ie how the duration of a bond changes as the interest rate changes of the portfolio at relatively low levels   we had fixedmaturity securities with a fair value of  million and an amortized cost of  million as of december   that are subject to interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of our fixedmaturity securities  in the management of this risk the characteristics of duration credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements   the table below summarizes the interest rate risk associated with our fixedmaturity securities by illustrating the sensitivity of the fair value of our fixedmaturity securities as of december   to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and the associated impact on our shareholders’ equity we anticipate that we will continue to meet our obligations from operating cash flows we classify our fixedmaturity securities and equity securities as availableforsale temporary changes in the fair value of our fixedmaturity securities impact the carrying value of these securities and are reported in our shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income net of deferred taxes  the selected scenarios in the table below are not predictions of future events but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the fair value and carrying value of our fixedmaturity securities and on our shareholders’ equity each as of december

changes in interest rates would affect the fair market value of our fixedrate debt instruments but would not have an impact on our earnings or cash flow as of december   we had  million of debt instruments gross of debt issuance costs a fluctuation of  basis points in interest on our variablerate debt instruments which are tied to libor would affect our earnings and cash flows by  million before income tax on an annual basis but would not affect the fair value of the variablerate debt   item  financial statements and supplementary data   the financial statements and financial statement

state national companies inc notes to consolidated financial statements    summary of significant accounting policies description of business state national companies inc the “company” refers to a group of companies that conducts insurancerelated activities along two major segments the company’s program services segment generates fee income in the form of ceding fees by offering issuing carrier capacity to both specialty general agents and other producers “gas” who sell control and administer books of insurance business that are supported by third parties that assume reinsurance risk  substantially all of the underwriting risk associated with the program services segment is ceded to unaffiliated highly rated reinsurance companies or other reinsurers that provide collateral  the company’s lender services segment generates premiums primarily from the sale of collateral protection insurance “cpi” which insures automobiles or other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions banks and specialty finance companies principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation  the company includes the results of operations of an acquired business in its consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition   basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which as to our insurance company subsidiaries differ from statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted for insurance companies by insurance regulatory authorities estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ materially from these estimates fair value of financial instruments cash and cash equivalents  the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value restricted cash and investments  the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value shortterm investments  the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value investments   see note  – “fair value measurements” land held for sale   the land held for sale is carried at fair value less expected selling costs payables and receivables   reinsurance recoverable on paid losses reinsurance recoverables agents’ balances receivable and payable and payable to insurance companies are carried at cost which approximates fair value subordinated debentures  the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets are carried at par which approximates their estimated fair value due to the floating interest rate provisions of the debt instruments f   table of contents state national companies inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued   income taxes receivablepayable  the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value other assetsliabilities  the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value cash and cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents shortterm investments shortterm investments represent liquid investments with original maturities of more than three months but less than one year restricted cash and investments restricted cash and investments are primarily comprised of deposits made by a reinsurer that cover losses for a program up to the contractual threshold these fiduciary cash and investment balances are invested at the direction of the reinsurer for this program accordingly income earned on these balances inures to the benefit of the reinsurer investments investments are considered availableforsale and are carried at fair value the company measures the fair value of the investments based upon quoted market prices from an independent pricing service and its thirdparty investment managers using observable market information the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method unrealized gains and losses associated with the availableforsale portfolio as a result of temporary changes in fair value during the period such investments are held are reflected net of income taxes and reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders’ equity unrealized losses associated with the availableforsale portfolio that are deemed to be otherthantemporary are charged to income in the period in which the otherthantemporary impairment is determined debt security premiums and discounts are amortized into earnings using the effectiveinterest method the company evaluates its investment portfolio for impairments of individual securities that are deemed to be otherthantemporary fixed maturity securities that are determined to have otherthantemporary impairment and it is more likely than not the company will sell before recovery of their amortized cost are written down to fair value and the entire amount of the writedown is included in net income net of realized investment gains for all other impaired fixedmaturity securities the impairment loss is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount representing all other factors the amount of impairment loss that represents the credit loss is included in net income net of realized investment gains the amount of the impairment loss that relates to all other factors is included in other comprehensive income equity securities that are determined to have otherthantemporary impairment are recognized in net income net of realized investment gains the process for identifying otherthantemporary declines in fair value involves the consideration of several factors including but not limited to whether the issuer has been downgraded to below investmentgrade the length of time in which there has been a significant decline in value the liquidity and overall financial condition of the issuer the nature and performance of the collateral or other credit support backing the security the significance of the decline in value and whether the company has the intent to sell the security or may be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery the company reviews securities for otherthantemporary impairment internally and with its investment advisors the company invests in convertible securities that have embedded derivatives  derivatives embedded within nonderivative instruments such as options embedded in convertible fixed maturity securities are bifurcated from the host instrument when the embedded derivative meets the criteria for bifurcation  however for reporting purposes f   table of contents state national companies inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued   these embedded derivatives are presented together with the host contract and carried at estimated fair value  changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are reflected in “realized net investment gains” in the consolidated statements of income while changes in the estimated fair value of the underlying fixed maturity securities are reflected in “unrealized holding gains losses” in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income deferred acquisition costs certain costs primarily premium taxes commissions and general expenses that are directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable from future premiums earned deferred acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the related unearned premium reserve over the terms of the related policies investment income is not included in the company’s recoverability analysis of deferred acquisition costs deferred ceding fees ceding fees that are associated with unearned premiums are established as a liability and earned pro rata over the life of the underlying business property equipment and depreciation property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from three to twenty years  gains and losses on the disposition of fixed assets are determined on a specific asset identification basis and are included in net income land held for sale is carried at fair value less expected selling costs goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the difference between the purchase price in a business combination and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is not amortized  intangible assets include assets with an indefinite life primarily insurance licenses and are not amortized  intangible assets also include assets with a finite life primarily customer relationshipslists and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset in proportion to the expected benefit goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment in the second step the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess as of december   the company performed the first step of its annual goodwill assessment for the individual reporting units to which goodwill is allocated and determined there is no impairment of goodwill the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets and takes into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists no impairments were recognized in   or  unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses “lae” includes an estimate for claims reported and an additional liability for claims incurred but not reported based on the company’s historical loss experience while f   table of contents state national companies inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued   management believes the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are adequate such estimates may be more or less than the amount ultimately paid when the claims are settled these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or as new information becomes known such adjustments are included in current operations allowance for policy cancellations an allowance for policy cancellations is provided for the estimated amount of return premiums and policy fees net of commission expense and premium taxes that will be incurred on expected future policy cancellations associated with the company’s cpi business the allowance is based on the company’s historical cancellation experience while management believes the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are adequate such estimates may be more or less than the amounts ultimately refunded the estimates are continually reviewed by management and any changes are reflected in current operations reinsurance reinsurance premiums losses and loss adjustment expenses are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts earnings per share the computation of earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the effect of common shares potentially issuable in periods in which they have a dilutive effect  earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect a  for  stock split in the form of a stock dividend on june   income taxes prior to june   the company had elected for its parent company to be taxed for federal income tax purposes as a “subchapter s corporation” under the internal revenue code  on june   the company completed a private placement of common stock which resulted in the termination of its subchapter s corporation status  prior to this change in tax status deferred income taxes were recorded only on the company’s insurance subsidiaries and their immediate parent to reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each yearend prior to june   all other entities included in the consolidated group filed under subchapter s corporation status therefore no provision for income taxes had been recorded for these entities  on june   the company recorded a net deferred income tax benefit related to this change in tax status to reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts for any uncertain tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” recognition threshold accounting standards require recognition measurement and disclosure in the financial statements there were no uncertain tax positions at december   and december   income recognition premiums on cpi business are earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies after taking into consideration the allowance for policy cancellations premiums on program services business are earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies ceding fees are earned on the same basis as the underlying premiums f   table of contents state national companies inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued   program services in connection with writing program services business the company enters into contractual agreements with both the producing general agents and the reinsurers whereby the general agents and reinsurers are typically obligated to each other for payment of insurance amounts including premiums commissions and losses  to the extent these funds are not the obligation of the company and are settled directly between the general agent and the reinsurer no receivables or payables are recorded for these amounts all obligations of the company’s insurance subsidiaries owed to or on behalf of their policyholders are recorded by the company and to the extent appropriate offsetting reinsurance recoverables are recorded minimum ceding fees minimum ceding fees are fees the company receives pursuant to contractual minimum premium requirements for certain programs where either significant premium capacity is reserved for that program or where the expected premium volume is not reasonably assured  for those programs where a minimum applies the ceding fees are considered as two distinct pieces   “premiumrelated fees” which are earned as the associated gross written premium is earned typically pro rata on an annual basis and  “capacity fees” which are determined based on the shortfall if any between the program’s contractual annual premium minimum and the amount of premium estimated to be written in the contract year which fees are earned over the contract year minimum ceding fees earned are based on estimates of annual premiums to be written for those programs that are subject to minimum premium levels and related ceding fees  these estimates are based upon various assumptions made regarding the production plans for the underlying program  these assumptions are reviewed by management and the amount of annual premiums expected to be written are reestimated as needed  as actual premiums emerge and revisions are made to earlier estimates minimum ceding fees are earned or reversed and are reflected in current operations stockbased compensation compensation expense for stockbased payments is recognized based on the measurementdate fair value for awards that will settle in shares  compensation expense for restricted stock grants and stock option awards that contain a service condition are recognized on a straight line pro rata basis over the vesting period  for restricted stock awards that contain a performance condition the expense is recognized based on the awards expected to vest and the cumulative expense is adjusted whenever the estimate of the number of awards to vest changes  an estimation of future forfeitures of stockbased awards is incorporated into the determination of compensation expense  see note  — “stockbased payments” for related disclosures   recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu  “revenue from contracts with customers” topic   the core guidance of the asu presents a comprehensive revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services  the asu provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized and requires additional disclosures sufficient to describe the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows for these transactions  in august  the fasb issued asu  to defer the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that period  earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that reporting period  an entity can choose to apply the guidance using either the full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach  the company is currently evaluating which approach to apply at adoption  the company has assessed its revenue streams to identify those contracts that are clearly excluded from the scope of the standard and those that may be subject to the new standard  insurance contracts within the scope of topic  “financial f   table of contents state national companies inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued   services – insurance” are excluded from the scope of topic   the company does not plan to early adopt and expects the impact of this pronouncement to be minimal   in august  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu  “presentation of financial statements – going concern subtopic   the asu requires management to perform a twostep evaluation to assess   an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued  management must first evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern if management concludes that substantial doubt is raised management also is required to consider whether its plans alleviate that doubt  disclosures in the notes to the financial statements are required if management concludes that substantial doubt exists or that its plans alleviate substantial doubt that was raised  this asu is effective for annual periods ending after december   and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter  the company adopted the provisions of this asu as of december    in may  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu  “disclosures about shortduration contracts” topic  intended to make targeted improvements to disclosure requirements for insurance companies that issue shortduration contracts  the amendments in this update are expected to increase transparency of significant estimates made in measuring those liabilities improve comparability by requiring consistent disclosure of information and provide financial statement users with additional information to facilitate analysis of the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from contracts issued by insurance entities and the development of loss reserve estimates  this asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within annual periods beginning after december    the company adopted the provisions of this asu on december    see note  – “losses and loss adjustment expenses” for related disclosures in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu  “business combinations  simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments” topic  which applies to all entities that have reported provisional amounts for items in a business combination for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized the amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined the amendments in this update require that the acquirer record in the same period’s financial statements the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects if any as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date the amendments in this update require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in currentperiod earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued the only disclosures required at transition are the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle an entity should disclose that information in the first annual period of adoption and in the interim periods within the first annual period if there is a measurementperiod adjustment during the first annual period in which the changes are effective the company adopted the provisions of this asu on january   in january  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu  “recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” subtopic   the amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories that is trading or availableforsale and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income  the amendments are expected to improve financial reporting by providing relevant information about an entity’s equity investments and reducing the number of items that are recognized in other comprehensive income  this asu is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december    the company is currently evaluating what impact this asu will have on financial results and disclosures f   table of contents state national companies inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued   in february  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu  “leases” topic  that requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements  the fasb is issuing this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements  this asu is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december    early adoption is permitted  the company does not plan to early adopt and is currently evaluating what impact this asu will have on financial results and disclosures   in march  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net”  the new standard requires an entity to determine whether it is a principal or an agent in a transaction in which another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer by evaluating the nature of its promise to the customer  an entity is a principal and therefore records revenue on a gross basis if it controls the promised good or service before transferring the good or service to the customer  an entity is an agent and records as revenue the net amount it retains for its agency services if its role is to arrange for another entity to provide the goods or services  the amendments clarify how an entity should identify the unit of accounting for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements such as service transactions by explaining what a principal controls before the specified good or service is transferred to the customer  this asu’s effective date and transition requirements are the same as those of the new revenue recognition standard which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that period  an entity can choose to apply the guidance using either the full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach  the company is currently evaluating which approach to apply at adoption  the company has assessed its revenue streams to identify those contracts that are clearly excluded from the scope of the standard and those that may be subject to the new standard  insurance contracts within the scope of topic  “financial services – insurance” are excluded from the scope of topic   the company expects the impact of this pronouncement to be minimal in march  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu  “compensation—stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting”  under the new guidance companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paidin capital apic  instead companies will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and apic pools will be eliminated  for interim reporting purposes companies will account for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as discrete items in the period in which they occur  in addition the guidance eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize them  the guidance requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity  this asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods  early adoption is permitted  the company prospectively adopted the provisions of this asu on january   and the impact was immaterial to financial results  there would have been no impact to prior periods in may  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  narrowscope improvements and practical expedients”  the amendments clarify that for a contract to be considered completed at transition all or substantially all of the revenue must have been recognized under legacy gaap  the amendments also clarify how an entity should evaluate the collectability threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard’s contract criteria  this asu’s effective date and transition requirements are the same as those of the new revenue recognition standard which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within that period  an entity can choose to apply the guidance using either the full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach  the company is currently evaluating which approach to apply at adoption  the company has assessed its revenue streams

standard will replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost and require entities to record allowances for availableforsale afs debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount as they do today under the otherthantemporary impairment otti model it also simplifies the accounting model for purchased creditimpaired debt
