nonobservant jewish family who like many uppermiddle class hungarian jews at the time were uncomfortable with their roots soros has described his home as antisemitic his mother erzsébet also known as elizabeth came from a family that owned a thriving silk shop his father tivadar also known as teodoro was a lawyer and had been a prisoner of war during and after world war i until he escaped from russia and rejoined his family in budapest the two married in  tivadar was an esperantist writer and taught soros to speak esperanto in his childhood in  soross family changed their name from the germanjewish schwartz to soros as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic hungary tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning in hungarian soros means next in line or designated successor in esperanto it means will soar soros was  years old in march  when nazi germany occupied hungary jewish children were barred from attending school by the nazis and soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the judenrat jewish council which had been established during the occupation soros later described this time to writer michael lewis the jewish council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices i was told to go to the jewish council and there i was given these small slips of paper i took this piece of paper to my father he instantly recognized it this was a list of hungarian jewish lawyers he said you deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported soros did not return to that job his family purchased documents to say that they were christians thereby allowing them to survive the war later that year at age  soros posed as the christian godson of an official of the collaborationist hungarian governments ministry of agriculture who himself had a jewish wife in hiding on one occasion rather than leave the  year old alone the official took soros with him while he inventoried a rich jewish familys estate though soros did not take part tivadar not only saved his immediate family but also many other hungarian jews and george would later write that  had been the happiest year of his life for it had given him the opportunity to witness his fathers heroism in  soros survived the siege of budapest in which soviet and german forces fought house to house through the city in  soros immigrated to england and became a student at the london school of economics while a student of the philosopher karl popper soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter soros received £ from a quaker charity in a discussion at the los angeles world affairs council in  alvin shuster former foreign editor of the los angeles times asked soros how does one go from an immigrant to a financier  when did you realize that you knew how to make money soros replied well i had a variety of jobs and i ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside souvenir shops and i thought thats really not what i was cut out to do so i wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in london got just one or two replies and eventually thats how i got a job in a merchant bank that job was an entrylevel position in singer  friedlander soros earned a bachelor of science in philosophy in  and a master of science in philosophy in  both from the london school of economics investment career early business experience after graduating soros found it difficult to get work and settled for a job as a traveling salesman for a fancygoods wholesaler selling to retailers in welsh seaside resorts he described this period as the low point of my life and wrote letters to a number of merchant banks requesting interviews many of these ignored him and others humiliated him in the interviews he credits his acceptance at singer and friedlander to the fact that the managing director was a fellow hungarian singer and friedlander in  soros began his financial career at the merchant bank singer  friedlander of london he worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department a fellow employee robert mayer suggested he apply at his fathers brokerage house fm mayer of new york fm mayer in  soros moved to new york city where he worked as an arbitrage trader for fm mayer – he specialized in european stocks which were becoming popular with us institutional investors following the formation of the coal and steel community which later became the common market wertheim and co in  after three years at fm mayer he moved to wertheim  co as an analyst of european securities where he stayed until  he planned to stay for five years enough time to save  after which he intended to return to england to study philosophy during this period soros developed the theory of reflexivity based on the ideas of karl popper reflexivity posited that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation reflexive feedback loops are created where ideas influence events and events influence ideas soros further argued that this leads to markets having procyclical virtuous or vicious cycles of boom and bust in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics arnhold and s bleichroeder from  to  soross experience as a vice president at arnhold and s bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job business was slack following the introduction of the interest equalization tax which undermined the viability of soross european trading he spent the years from  to  with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation in  he started a fund with  of the firms money to experiment with his trading strategies but he was principally motivated by a desire to assert himself as an investor to profit from his reflexivity insights in  soros set up the double eagle hedge fund with m of investors capital including  of his own money it was based in curaçao dutch antilles in  the double eagle fund had  million and formed the basis of the soros fund george soros and jim rogers received returns on their share of capital and  percent of the profits each year soros fund management in  soros founded soros fund management and became its chairman among those who held senior positions there at various times were jim rogers stanley druckenmiller mark schwartz keith anderson and soross two sons in  due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds soros resigned from the management of the double eagle fund he then established the soros fund and gave investors in the double eagle fund the option of transferring to that or staying with arnhold and s bleichroeder it was later renamed as the quantum fund named after the physical theory of quantum mechanics by that time the value of the fund had grown to m only a small proportion of which was soross own money he and jim rogers reinvested their returns from the fund and also a large part of their  performance fees thereby expanding their stake by  the fund had grown to m and then a  loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to m in july  soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors money valued at  billion and instead invested funds from his  billion family fortune due to changes in us securities and exchange commission disclosure rules which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors the fund had at that time averaged over  per year compound returns in  the quantum fund made  billion making it again the most successful hedge fund in history since its inception in  the fund has generated  billion the fund announced that it would inject  million to help finance the expansion of fen hotels an argentine hotel company the funds will develop  rooms over the next three years throughout various latin american countries  pound short soros had been building a huge position in pounds sterling for months leading up to september  soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the united kingdom in the european exchange rate mechanism for soros the rate at which the united kingdom was brought into the european exchange rate mechanism was too high their inflation was also much too high triple the german rate and british interest rates were hurting their asset prices on september   black wednesday soross fund sold short more than  billion in pounds profiting from the uk governments reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other european exchange rate mechanism countries or float its currency finally the uk withdrew from the european exchange rate mechanism devaluing the pound soross profit on the bet was estimated at over  billion he was dubbed the man who broke the bank of england the estimated cost of black wednesday to the uk treasury was £ billion on october   the times quoted soros as saying our total position by black wednesday had to be worth almost  billion we planned to sell more than that in fact when norman lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly  billion to defend sterling we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell stanley druckenmiller who traded under soros originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated soross contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position in  during the asian financial crisis the prime minister of malaysia mahathir bin mohamad accused soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the association of southeast asian nations asean for welcoming myanmar as a member following on a history of antisemitic remarks mahathir made specific reference to soross jewish background it is a jew who triggered the currency plunge and implied soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger jewish conspiracy nine years later in  mahathir met with soros and afterward stated that he accepted that soros had not been responsible for the crisis in s the crisis of global capitalism open society endangered soros explained his role in the crisis as follows the financial crisis that originated in thailand in  was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity by the beginning of  it was clear to soros fund management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable we sold short the thai baht and the malaysian ringgit early in  with maturities ranging from six months to a year that is we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates thai baht and malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold subsequently prime minister mahathir of malaysia accused me of causing the crisis a wholly unfounded accusation we were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis on the contrary we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation much too soon as it turned out we left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that mahathir would impose capital controls he did so but much later in  economist paul krugman was critical of soross effect on financial markets nobody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit these new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name my proposed term is soroi in an interview regarding the lates recession soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the s according to soros market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been some kind of an ideological excess in soross view the markets moods—a mood of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimismpessimism with which the markets look at reality—actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially selfreinforcing but eventually unsustainable and selfdefeating boombust sequences or bubbles in reaction to the lates recession he founded the institute for new economic thinking in october  this is a think tank composed of international economic business and financial experts mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system société générale insider trade in  soros was contacted by a french financier named georges pébereau who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in société générale a leading french bank that was part of a privatization program something instituted by the new government under jacques chirac soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four french companies société générale as well as suez paribas and the compagnie générale délectricité in  the commission des opérations de bourse cob—the french stock exchange regulatory authority conducted an investigation of whether soross transaction in société générale should be considered insider trading soros had received no information from the société générale and had no insider knowledge of the business but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt initial investigations found soros innocent and no charges were brought forward however the case was reopened a few years later and the french supreme court confirmed the conviction on june   but reduced the penalty to € soros denied any wrongdoing saying news of the takeover was public knowledge and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover in december  he appealed to the european court of human rights on various grounds including that the year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing on the basis of article  of the european convention on human rights stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed the court agreed to hear the appeal in october  the court rejected his appeal in a – decision saying that soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws personal life soros has been married three times and divorced twice in  he married annaliese witschak annaliese

is less addictive but not appropriate for use by children and students he himself has not used marijuana for years soros has been a major financier of the drug policy alliance – an organization that promotes cannabis legalization – with roughly  million in annual contributions from one of his foundations death and dying the project on death in america active from  to  was one of the open society institutes projects which sought to understand and transform the culture and experience of dying and bereavement in  soros delivered a speech in which he reported that he had offered to help his mother a member of the hemlock society commit suicide in the same speech he also endorsed the oregon death with dignity act proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign political and economic views external video george soros the lecture series introduction  general theory of reflexivity  financial markets  open society  capitalism vs open society  all by the open society foundations reflexivity financial markets and economic theory soross writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a near to equilibrium or a far from equilibrium state he argues that when markets are rising or falling rapidly they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium and that the conventional economic theory of the market the efficient market hypothesis does not apply in these situations soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium static disequilibrium and nearequilibrium conditions he has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect reflexivity is based on three main ideas reflexivity is best observed under special conditions where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena examples of factors that may give rise to this bias include a equity leveraging or b the trendfollowing habits of speculators reflexivity appears intermittently since it is most likely to be revealed under certain conditions ie the character of the equilibrium process is best considered in terms of probabilities investors observation of and participation in the capital markets may at times influence valuations and fundamental conditions or outcomes a recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets lenders began to make more money available to more people in the s to buy houses more people bought houses with this larger amount of money thus increasing the prices of these houses lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans but that their equity backing the loans – the value of the houses had gone up because more money was chasing the same amount of housing relatively thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good and prices rose higher still this was further amplified by public policy in the us home loans were guaranteed by the federal government many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for firsttime home buyers and other financial subsidies such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation these further encouraged house purchases leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards the concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot soros theories were originally dismissed by economists but have received more attention after the  crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the journal of economic methodology the notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of complexity economics as developed at the santa fe institute although soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the s reflexivity in politics although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets he has also explored its effects in politics he has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the open society in the past were from communism and fascism as discussed in the open society and its enemies by his mentor karl popper the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism he has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the united states is a reflexive phenomenon insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable view of problems in the free market system soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries he blames many of the worlds problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism soros claims to draw a distinction between being a participant in the market and working to change the rules that market participants must follow market predictions soross book the new paradigm for financial markets may  described a superbubble that had built up over the past  years and was ready to collapse this was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster as he states i have a record of crying wolf i did it first in the alchemy of finance in  then in the crisis of global capitalism in  and now in this book so its three books predicting disaster after the boy cried wolf three times  the wolf really came he ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong im only rich because i know when im wrong i basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes i very often used to get backaches due to the fact that i was wrong whenever you are wrong you have to fight or take flight when i make the decision the backache goes away in february  soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated adding that there was no prospect of a nearterm resolution to the crisis we witnessed the collapse of the financial system it was placed on life support and its still on life support theres no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom in january  at an economic forum in sri lanka soros predicted a financial crisis akin to  based on the state of global currency stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking chinese yuan china has a major adjustment problem i would say it amounts to a crisis when i look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in  views on antisemitism and israel when asked about what he thought about israel in the new yorker soros replied that i dont deny the jews to a right to a national existence – but i dont want anything to do with it according to hacked emails released in  soros open society foundation has a selfdescribed objective of “challenging israel’s racist and antidemocratic policies” in international forums in part by questioning israel’s reputation as a democracy he has funded ngos which have been actively critical of israeli policies including groups that campaign for the boycott divestment and sanctions movement against israel soros has been accused of saying that both jews and israel are partially responsible for antisemitism in response to his statement that the administrations of gw bush in the us and ariel sharon in israel were stoking antisemitism he has also said that jews cant overcome antisemitism without giving up on the tribalness on november   at a jewish forum in new york city soros partially attributed a recent resurgence of antisemitism to the policies of israel and the united states and the role of wealthy and influential individuals there is a resurgence of antisemitism in europe the policies of the bush administration and the sharon administration contribute to that its not specifically antisemitism but it does manifest itself in antisemitism as well im critical of those policies if we change that direction then antisemitism also will diminish i cant see how one could confront it directly im also very concerned about my own role because the new antisemitism holds that the jews rule the world as an unintended consequence of my actions i also contribute to that image in a subsequent article for the new york review of books soros emphasized that i do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of israel and i am not blaming jews for antisemitism antisemitism predates the birth of israel neither israels policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for antisemitism at the same time i do believe that attitudes toward israel are influenced by israels policies and attitudes toward the jewish community are influenced by the proisrael lobbys success in suppressing divergent views during a  billion lawsuit against soros by beny steinmetzs israeli company bsg resources which alleged soros used his sway with the government of guinea to freeze the israeli company out of iron ore mining contracts  the lawsuit alleges that soros hostility to israel is a motive for his actions to soros steinmetz’s success as well as his active passionate promotion of israeli life business and culture are anathema” bsgr said in the lawsuit “soros is also well known for his longstanding animus toward the state of israel during an award ceremony for imre kertész soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming “perpetrators of violence” suggesting that this model explained israels behaviour towards the palestinians which led to walkouts and soros being booed in july  israels ministry of foreign affairs released a statement denouncing soros a move that appeared designed to align israel more closely with hungary ahead of a visit to budapest by prime minister benjamin netanyahu israels foreign ministry stated the soros continuously undermines israels democratically elected governments adding that soros funded organizations that defame the jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself views on the us on november   in an interview with the washington post soros said that removing president george w bush from office was the central focus of my life and a matter of life and death he said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat bush if someone guaranteed it soros gave  million to the center for american progress  million to moveonorg and  million to america coming together these groups worked to support democrats in the  election on september   he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech why we must not reelect president bush delivered at the national press club in washington dc the online transcript to this speech received many hits after dick cheney accidentally referred to factcheckorg as factcheckcom in the vice presidential debate causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to soross site his  book the bubble of american supremacy was a forthright critique of the bush administrations war on terror as misconceived and counterproductive and a polemic against the reelection of bush he explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the selfreinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices when soros was asked in  about his statement in the age of fallibility that the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the united states he responded that it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world and i think thats rather shocking for americans to hear the united states sets the agenda for the world and the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda by declaring a war on terror after september  we set the wrong agenda for the world when you wage war you inevitably create innocent victims soros described donald trump as a con man soros expects trump to fail because soros believes trumps ideas are selfcontradictory soros believes trump is preparing for a trade war and expects financial markets to do badly views on europe in october  soros drafted an open letter entitled as concerned europeans we urge eurozone leaders to unite in which he calls for a stronger economic government for europe using federal means common eu treasury common fiscal supervision etc and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the economic crisis the letter was cosigned by javier solana daniel cohnbendit andrew duff emma bonino massimo dalema vaira vikefreiberga soros criticized hungarian prime minister viktor orbán and his handling of the european migrant crisis in  his plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle soros expects that brexit will fail and the premiership of theresa may will last only a short time views on asia soros has expressed concern about the growth of chinese economic and political power saying china has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests they have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well regarding the political gridlock in america he said today china has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the united states in july  soros stated that a strategic partnership between the us and china could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict in january  during an interview at the world economic forum wef in davos soros stated that a hard landing is practically unavoidable chinese state media responded by stating soros’ challenge to the rmb and hong kong dollar are doomed to fail without any doubt views on russia and ukraine in may  soros told cnns fareed zakaria i set up a foundation in ukraine before ukraine became independent from russia and the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now in january  soros said that europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from russia he also urged western countries to expand economic sanctions against russia for its support of separatists in eastern ukraine in january  soros called on the european union to give  billion of bailout money to ukraine in july  soros stated that putins annexation of crimea was a challenge to the prevailing world order specifically the european union he hypothesized that putin wants to destabilize all of ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern ukraine which would then depend on russia for economic support in november  russia banned the open society foundations osf and the open society institute osi two prodemocracy charities founded by soros—stating they posed as threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the russian federation and the security of the state in january   books related to soros renewal of humanitarian education program were burned at vorkuta mining and economic college in the komi republic with  additional books seized for shredding a russian intergovernmental letter released in december  stated that soros charities were forming a perverted perception of history and making ideological directives alien to russian ideology popular wealth and philanthropy for more details on george soros philanthropy see list of projects supported by george soros george soros speaks to the lse alumni society in malaysia as of february  forbes magazine listed soros as the th richest person in the world the worlds richest hedgefund manager and th on its list of the  wealthiest americans with a net worth estimated at  billion soros lost almost  billion in the weeks after the election of republican donald trump as us president in  soros has been active as a philanthropist since the s when he began providing funds to help black students attend the university of cape town in apartheid south africa and began funding dissident movements behind the iron curtain soross philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote nonviolent democratization in the postsoviet states these efforts mostly in central and eastern europe occur primarily through the open society foundations originally open society institute or osi and national soros foundations which sometimes go under other names such as the stefan batory foundation in poland as of  pbs estimated that he had given away a total of  billion the osi says it has spent about  million annually in recent years in  former federal reserve chairman paul volcker wrote in the foreword of soross book the alchemy of finance george soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game the bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become open societies open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but—more important—tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior time magazine in  cited two specific projects— million toward internet infrastructure for regional russian universities and  million for the millennium promise to eradicate extreme poverty in africa—noting that soros had given  million to projects in the us and given away a total of more than  billion other notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern europe help to civilians during the siege of sarajevo and transparency international soros also pledged an endowment of € million to the central european university ceu the nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus and his microfinance bank grameen bank received support from the osicitation needed according to national review online the open society institute gave  in september  to the defense committee of lynne stewart the lawyer who has defended controversial poor and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to ⅓ years in prison for providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy via a press conference for a client an osi spokeswoman said it appeared to us at that time that there was a righttocounsel issue worthy of our support but claimed later requests for support were declined in september  soros pledged  million to the millennium promise led by economist jeffrey sachs to provide educational agricultural and medical aid to help villages in africa enduring poverty the new york times termed this endeavor a departure for soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government but soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance soros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in hungary – and provided a substantial endowment to central european university in budapest the open society foundations has active programs in more than  countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately  million a year legacy and awards soros received honorary doctoral degrees from the new school for social research new york the university of oxford in  the corvinus university of budapest and yale university in  he received the yale international center for finance

interviews  external links early life and education soros was born in budapest in the kingdom of hungary to a welltodo nonobservant jewish family who like many uppermiddle class hungarian jews at the time were uncomfortable with their roots soros has described his home as antisemitic his mother erzsébet also known as elizabeth came from a family that owned a thriving silk shop his father tivadar also known as teodoro was a lawyer and had been a prisoner of war during and after world war i until he escaped from russia and rejoined his family in budapest the two married in  tivadar was an esperantist writer and taught soros to speak esperanto in his childhood in  soross family changed their name from the germanjewish schwartz to soros as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic hungary tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning in hungarian soros means next in line or designated successor in esperanto it means will soar soros was  years old in march  when nazi germany occupied hungary jewish children were barred from attending school by the nazis and soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the judenrat jewish council which had been established during the occupation soros later described this time to writer michael lewis the jewish council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices i was told to go to the jewish council and there i was given these small slips of paper i took this piece of paper to my father he instantly recognized it this was a list of hungarian jewish lawyers he said you deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported soros did not return to that job his family purchased documents to say that they were christians thereby allowing them to survive the war later that year at age  soros posed as the christian godson of an official of the collaborationist hungarian governments ministry of agriculture who himself had a jewish wife in hiding on one occasion rather than leave the  year old alone the official took soros with him while he inventoried a rich jewish familys estate though soros did not take part tivadar not only saved his immediate family but also many other hungarian jews and george would later write that  had been the happiest year of his life for it had given him the opportunity to witness his fathers heroism in  soros survived the siege of budapest in which soviet and german forces fought house to house through the city in  soros immigrated to england and became a student at the london school of economics while a student of the philosopher karl popper soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter soros received £ from a quaker charity in a discussion at the los angeles world affairs council in  alvin shuster former foreign editor of the los angeles times asked soros how does one go from an immigrant to a financier  when did you realize that you knew how to make money soros replied well i had a variety of jobs and i ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside souvenir shops and i thought thats really not what i was cut out to do so i wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in london got just one or two replies and eventually thats how i got a job in a merchant bank that job was an entrylevel position in singer  friedlander soros earned a bachelor of science in philosophy in  and a master of science in philosophy in  both from the london school of economics investment career early business experience after graduating soros found it difficult to get work and settled for a job as a traveling salesman for a fancygoods wholesaler selling to retailers in welsh seaside resorts he described this period as the low point of my life and wrote letters to a number of merchant banks requesting interviews many of these ignored him and others humiliated him in the interviews he credits his acceptance at singer and friedlander to the fact that the managing director was a fellow hungarian singer and friedlander in  soros began his financial career at the merchant bank singer  friedlander of london he worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department a fellow employee robert mayer suggested he apply at his fathers brokerage house fm mayer of new york fm mayer in  soros moved to new york city where he worked as an arbitrage trader for fm mayer – he specialized in european stocks which were becoming popular with us institutional investors following the formation of the coal and steel community which later became the common market wertheim and co in  after three years at fm mayer he moved to wertheim  co as an analyst of european securities where he stayed until  he planned to stay for five years enough time to save  after which he intended to return to england to study philosophy during this period soros developed the theory of reflexivity based on the ideas of karl popper reflexivity posited that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation reflexive feedback loops are created where ideas influence events and events influence ideas soros further argued that this leads to markets having procyclical virtuous or vicious cycles of boom and bust in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics arnhold and s bleichroeder from  to  soross experience as a vice president at arnhold and s bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job business was slack following the introduction of the interest equalization tax which undermined the viability of soross european trading he spent the years from  to  with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation in  he started a fund with  of the firms money to experiment with his trading strategies but he was principally motivated by a desire to assert himself as an investor to profit from his reflexivity insights in  soros set up the double eagle hedge fund with m of investors capital including  of his own money it was based in curaçao dutch antilles in  the double eagle fund had  million and formed the basis of the soros fund george soros and jim rogers received returns on their share of capital and  percent of the profits each year soros fund management in  soros founded soros fund management and became its chairman among those who held senior positions there at various times were jim rogers stanley druckenmiller mark schwartz keith anderson and soross two sons in  due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds soros resigned from the management of the double eagle fund he then established the soros fund and gave investors in the double eagle fund the option of transferring to that or staying with arnhold and s bleichroeder it was later renamed as the quantum fund named after the physical theory of quantum mechanics by that time the value of the fund had grown to m only a small proportion of which was soross own money he and jim rogers reinvested their returns from the fund and also a large part of their  performance fees thereby expanding their stake by  the fund had grown to m and then a  loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to m in july  soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors money valued at  billion and instead invested funds from his  billion family fortune due to changes in us securities and exchange commission disclosure rules which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors the fund had at that time averaged over  per year compound returns in  the quantum fund made  billion making it again the most successful hedge fund in history since its inception in  the fund has generated  billion the fund announced that it would inject  million to help finance the expansion of fen hotels an argentine hotel company the funds will develop  rooms over the next three years throughout various latin american countries  pound short soros had been building a huge position in pounds sterling for months leading up to september  soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the united kingdom in the european exchange rate mechanism for soros the rate at which the united kingdom was brought into the european exchange rate mechanism was too high their inflation was also much too high triple the german rate and british interest rates were hurting their asset prices on september   black wednesday soross fund sold short more than  billion in pounds profiting from the uk governments reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other european exchange rate mechanism countries or float its currency finally the uk withdrew from the european exchange rate mechanism devaluing the pound soross profit on the bet was estimated at over  billion he was dubbed the man who broke the bank of england the estimated cost of black wednesday to the uk treasury was £ billion on october   the times quoted soros as saying our total position by black wednesday had to be worth almost  billion we planned to sell more than that in fact when norman lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly  billion to defend sterling we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell stanley druckenmiller who traded under soros originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated soross contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position in  during the asian financial crisis the prime minister of malaysia mahathir bin mohamad accused soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the association of southeast asian nations asean for welcoming myanmar as a member following on a history of antisemitic remarks mahathir made specific reference to soross jewish background it is a jew who triggered the currency plunge and implied soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger jewish conspiracy nine years later in  mahathir met with soros and afterward stated that he accepted that soros had not been responsible for the crisis in s the crisis of global capitalism open society endangered soros explained his role in the crisis as follows the financial crisis that originated in thailand in  was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity by the beginning of  it was clear to soros fund management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable we sold short the thai baht and the malaysian ringgit early in  with maturities ranging from six months to a year that is we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates thai baht and malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold subsequently prime minister mahathir of malaysia accused me of causing the crisis a wholly unfounded accusation we were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis on the contrary we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation much too soon as it turned out we left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that mahathir would impose capital controls he did so but much later in  economist paul krugman was critical of soross effect on financial markets nobody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit these new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name my proposed term is soroi in an interview regarding the lates recession soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the s according to soros market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been some kind of an ideological excess in soross view the markets moods—a mood of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimismpessimism with which the markets look at reality—actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially selfreinforcing but eventually unsustainable and selfdefeating boombust sequences or bubbles in reaction to the lates recession he founded the institute for new economic thinking in october  this is a think tank composed of international economic business and financial experts mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system société générale insider trade in  soros was contacted by a french financier named georges pébereau who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in société générale a leading french bank that was part of a privatization program something instituted by the new government under jacques chirac soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four french companies société générale as well as suez paribas and the compagnie générale délectricité in  the commission des opérations de bourse cob—the french stock exchange regulatory authority conducted an investigation of whether soross transaction in société générale should be considered insider trading soros had received no information from the société générale and had no insider knowledge of the business but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt initial investigations found soros innocent and no charges were brought forward however the case was reopened a few years later and the french supreme court confirmed the conviction on june   but reduced the penalty to € soros denied any wrongdoing saying news of the takeover was public knowledge and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover in december  he appealed to the european court of human rights on various grounds including that the year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing on the basis of article  of the european convention on human rights stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed the court agreed to hear the appeal in october  the court rejected his appeal in a – decision saying that soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws personal life soros has been married three times and divorced twice in  he married annaliese witschak annaliese was an ethnic german immigrant who had been

donated  million to support californias proposition  according to remarks in an interview in october  it is soross opinion that marijuana is less addictive but not appropriate for use by children and students he himself has not used marijuana for years soros has been a major financier of the drug policy alliance – an organization that promotes cannabis legalization – with roughly  million in annual contributions from one of his foundations death and dying the project on death in america active from  to  was one of the open society institutes projects which sought to understand and transform the culture and experience of dying and bereavement in  soros delivered a speech in which he reported that he had offered to help his mother a member of the hemlock society commit suicide in the same speech he also endorsed the oregon death with dignity act proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign political and economic views external video george soros the lecture series introduction  general theory of reflexivity  financial markets  open society  capitalism vs open society  all by the open society foundations reflexivity financial markets and economic theory soross writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a near to equilibrium or a far from equilibrium state he argues that when markets are rising or falling rapidly they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium and that the conventional economic theory of the market the efficient market hypothesis does not apply in these situations soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium static disequilibrium and nearequilibrium conditions he has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect reflexivity is based on three main ideas reflexivity is best observed under special conditions where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena examples of factors that may give rise to this bias include a equity leveraging or b the trendfollowing habits of speculators reflexivity appears intermittently since it is most likely to be revealed under certain conditions ie the character of the equilibrium process is best considered in terms of probabilities investors observation of and participation in the capital markets may at times influence valuations and fundamental conditions or outcomes a recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets lenders began to make more money available to more people in the s to buy houses more people bought houses with this larger amount of money thus increasing the prices of these houses lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans but that their equity backing the loans – the value of the houses had gone up because more money was chasing the same amount of housing relatively thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good and prices rose higher still this was further amplified by public policy in the us home loans were guaranteed by the federal government many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for firsttime home buyers and other financial subsidies such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation these further encouraged house purchases leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards the concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot soros theories were originally dismissed by economists but have received more attention after the  crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the journal of economic methodology the notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of complexity economics as developed at the santa fe institute although soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the s reflexivity in politics although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets he has also explored its effects in politics he has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the open society in the past were from communism and fascism as discussed in the open society and its enemies by his mentor karl popper the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism he has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the united states is a reflexive phenomenon insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable view of problems in the free market system soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries he blames many of the worlds problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism soros claims to draw a distinction between being a participant in the market and working to change the rules that market participants must follow market predictions soross book the new paradigm for financial markets may  described a superbubble that had built up over the past  years and was ready to collapse this was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster as he states i have a record of crying wolf i did it first in the alchemy of finance in  then in the crisis of global capitalism in  and now in this book so its three books predicting disaster after the boy cried wolf three times  the wolf really came he ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong im only rich because i know when im wrong i basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes i very often used to get backaches due to the fact that i was wrong whenever you are wrong you have to fight or take flight when i make the decision the backache goes away in february  soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated adding that there was no prospect of a nearterm resolution to the crisis we witnessed the collapse of the financial system it was placed on life support and its still on life support theres no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom in january  at an economic forum in sri lanka soros predicted a financial crisis akin to  based on the state of global currency stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking chinese yuan china has a major adjustment problem i would say it amounts to a crisis when i look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in  views on antisemitism and israel when asked about what he thought about israel in the new yorker soros replied that i dont deny the jews to a right to a national existence – but i dont want anything to do with it according to hacked emails released in  soros open society foundation has a selfdescribed objective of “challenging israel’s racist and antidemocratic policies” in international forums in part by questioning israel’s reputation as a democracy he has funded ngos which have been actively critical of israeli policies including groups that campaign for the boycott divestment and sanctions movement against israel soros has been accused of saying that both jews and israel are partially responsible for antisemitism in response to his statement that the administrations of gw bush in the us and ariel sharon in israel were stoking antisemitism he has also said that jews cant overcome antisemitism without giving up on the tribalness on november   at a jewish forum in new york city soros partially attributed a recent resurgence of antisemitism to the policies of israel and the united states and the role of wealthy and influential individuals there is a resurgence of antisemitism in europe the policies of the bush administration and the sharon administration contribute to that its not specifically antisemitism but it does manifest itself in antisemitism as well im critical of those policies if we change that direction then antisemitism also will diminish i cant see how one could confront it directly im also very concerned about my own role because the new antisemitism holds that the jews rule the world as an unintended consequence of my actions i also contribute to that image in a subsequent article for the new york review of books soros emphasized that i do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of israel and i am not blaming jews for antisemitism antisemitism predates the birth of israel neither israels policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for antisemitism at the same time i do believe that attitudes toward israel are influenced by israels policies and attitudes toward the jewish community are influenced by the proisrael lobbys success in suppressing divergent views during a  billion lawsuit against soros by beny steinmetzs israeli company bsg resources which alleged soros used his sway with the government of guinea to freeze the israeli company out of iron ore mining contracts  the lawsuit alleges that soros hostility to israel is a motive for his actions to soros steinmetz’s success as well as his active passionate promotion of israeli life business and culture are anathema” bsgr said in the lawsuit “soros is also well known for his longstanding animus toward the state of israel during an award ceremony for imre kertész soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming “perpetrators of violence” suggesting that this model explained israels behaviour towards the palestinians which led to walkouts and soros being booed in july  israels ministry of foreign affairs released a statement denouncing soros a move that appeared designed to align israel more closely with hungary ahead of a visit to budapest by prime minister benjamin netanyahu israels foreign ministry stated the soros continuously undermines israels democratically elected governments adding that soros funded organizations that defame the jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself views on the us on november   in an interview with the washington post soros said that removing president george w bush from office was the central focus of my life and a matter of life and death he said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat bush if someone guaranteed it soros gave  million to the center for american progress  million to moveonorg and  million to america coming together these groups worked to support democrats in the  election on september   he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech why we must not reelect president bush delivered at the national press club in washington dc the online transcript to this speech received many hits after dick cheney accidentally referred to factcheckorg as factcheckcom in the vice presidential debate causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to soross site his  book the bubble of american supremacy was a forthright critique of the bush administrations war on terror as misconceived and counterproductive and a polemic against the reelection of bush he explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the selfreinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices when soros was asked in  about his statement in the age of fallibility that the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the united states he responded that it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world and i think thats rather shocking for americans to hear the united states sets the agenda for the world and the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda by declaring a war on terror after september  we set the wrong agenda for the world when you wage war you inevitably create innocent victims soros described donald trump as a con man soros expects trump to fail because soros believes trumps ideas are selfcontradictory soros believes trump is preparing for a trade war and expects financial markets to do badly views on europe in october  soros drafted an open letter entitled as concerned europeans we urge eurozone leaders to unite in which he calls for a stronger economic government for europe using federal means common eu treasury common fiscal supervision etc and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the economic crisis the letter was cosigned by javier solana daniel cohnbendit andrew duff emma bonino massimo dalema vaira vikefreiberga soros criticized hungarian prime minister viktor orbán and his handling of the european migrant crisis in  his plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle soros expects that brexit will fail and the premiership of theresa may will last only a short time views on asia soros has expressed concern about the growth of chinese economic and political power saying china has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests they have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well regarding the political gridlock in america he said today china has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the united states in july  soros stated that a strategic partnership between the us and china could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict in january  during an interview at the world economic forum wef in davos soros stated that a hard landing is practically unavoidable chinese state media responded by stating soros’ challenge to the rmb and hong kong dollar are doomed to fail without any doubt views on russia and ukraine in may  soros told cnns fareed zakaria i set up a foundation in ukraine before ukraine became independent from russia and the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now in january  soros said that europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from russia he also urged western countries to expand economic sanctions against russia for its support of separatists in eastern ukraine in january  soros called on the european union to give  billion of bailout money to ukraine in july  soros stated that putins annexation of crimea was a challenge to the prevailing world order specifically the european union he hypothesized that putin wants to destabilize all of ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern ukraine which would then depend on russia for economic support in november  russia banned the open society foundations osf and the open society institute osi two prodemocracy charities founded by soros—stating they posed as threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the russian federation and the security of the state in january   books related to soros renewal of humanitarian education program were burned at vorkuta mining and economic college in the komi republic with  additional books seized for shredding a russian intergovernmental letter released in december  stated that soros charities were forming a perverted perception of history and making ideological directives alien to russian ideology popular wealth and philanthropy for more details on george soros philanthropy see list of projects supported by george soros george soros speaks to the lse alumni

worth estimated at  billion soros lost almost  billion in the weeks after the election of republican donald trump as us president in  soros has been active as a philanthropist since the s when he began providing funds to help black students attend the university of cape town in apartheid south africa and began funding dissident movements behind the iron curtain soross philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote nonviolent democratization in the postsoviet states these efforts mostly in central and eastern europe occur primarily through the open society foundations originally open society institute or osi and national soros foundations which sometimes go under other names such as the stefan batory foundation in poland as of  pbs estimated that he had given away a total of  billion the osi says it has spent about  million annually in recent years in  former federal reserve chairman paul volcker wrote in the foreword of soross book the alchemy of finance george soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game the bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become open societies open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but—more important—tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior time magazine in  cited two specific projects— million toward internet infrastructure for regional russian universities and  million for the millennium promise to eradicate extreme poverty in africa—noting that soros had given  million to projects in the us and given away a total of more than  billion other notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern europe help to civilians during the siege of sarajevo and transparency international soros also pledged an endowment of € million to the central european university ceu the nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus and his microfinance bank grameen bank received support from the osicitation needed according to national review online the open society institute gave  in september  to the defense committee of lynne stewart the lawyer who has defended controversial poor and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to ⅓ years in prison for providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy via a press conference for a client an osi spokeswoman said it appeared to us at that time that there was a righttocounsel issue worthy of our support but claimed later requests for support were declined in september  soros pledged  million to the millennium promise led by economist jeffrey sachs to provide educational agricultural and medical aid to help villages in africa enduring poverty the new york times termed this endeavor a departure for soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government but soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance soros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in hungary – and provided a substantial endowment to central european university in budapest the open society foundations has active programs in more than  countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately  million a year legacy and awards soros received honorary doctoral degrees from the

the kingdom of hungary to a welltodo nonobservant jewish family who like many uppermiddle class hungarian jews at the time were uncomfortable with their roots soros has described his home as antisemitic his mother erzsébet also known as elizabeth came from a family that owned a thriving silk shop his father tivadar also known as teodoro was a lawyer and had been a prisoner of war during and after world war i until he escaped from russia and rejoined his family in budapest the two married in  tivadar was an esperantist writer and taught soros to speak esperanto in his childhood in  soross family changed their name from the germanjewish schwartz to soros as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic hungary tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning in hungarian soros means next in line or designated successor in esperanto it means will soar soros was  years old in march  when nazi germany occupied hungary jewish children were barred from attending school by the nazis and soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the judenrat jewish council which had been established during the occupation soros later described this time to writer michael lewis the jewish council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices i was told to go to the jewish council and there i was given these small slips of paper i took this piece of paper to my father he instantly recognized it this was a list of hungarian jewish lawyers he said you deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported soros did not return to that job his family purchased documents to say that they were christians thereby allowing them to survive the war later that year at age  soros posed as the christian godson of an official of the collaborationist hungarian governments ministry of agriculture who himself had a jewish wife in hiding on one occasion rather than leave the  year old alone the official took soros with him while he inventoried a rich jewish familys estate though soros did not take part tivadar not only saved his immediate family but also many other hungarian jews and george would later write that  had been the happiest year of his life for it had given him the opportunity to witness his fathers heroism in  soros survived the siege of budapest in which soviet and german forces fought house to house through the city in  soros immigrated to england and became a student at the london school of economics while a student of the philosopher karl popper soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter soros received £ from a quaker charity in a discussion at the los angeles world affairs council in  alvin shuster former foreign editor of the los angeles times asked soros how does one go from an immigrant to a financier  when did you realize that you knew how to make money soros replied well i had a variety of jobs and i ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside souvenir shops and i thought thats really not what i was cut out to do so i wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in london got just one or two replies and eventually thats how i got a job in a merchant bank that job was an entrylevel position in singer  friedlander soros earned a bachelor of science in philosophy in  and a master of science in philosophy in  both from the london school of economics investment career early business experience after graduating soros found it difficult to get work and settled for a job as a traveling salesman for a fancygoods wholesaler selling to retailers in welsh seaside resorts he described this period as the low point of my life and wrote letters to a number of merchant banks requesting interviews many of these ignored him and others humiliated him in the interviews he credits his acceptance at singer and friedlander to the fact that the managing director was a fellow hungarian singer and friedlander in  soros began his financial career at the merchant bank singer  friedlander of london he worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department a fellow employee robert mayer suggested he apply at his fathers brokerage house fm mayer of new york fm mayer in  soros moved to new york city where he worked as an arbitrage trader for fm mayer – he specialized in european stocks which were becoming popular with us institutional investors following the formation of the coal and steel community which later became the common market wertheim and co in  after three years at fm mayer he moved to wertheim  co as an analyst of european securities where he stayed until  he planned to stay for five years enough time to save  after which he intended to return to england to study philosophy during this period soros developed the theory of reflexivity based on the ideas of karl popper reflexivity posited that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation reflexive feedback loops are created where ideas influence events and events influence ideas soros further argued that this leads to markets having procyclical virtuous or vicious cycles of boom and bust in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics arnhold and s bleichroeder from  to  soross experience as a vice president at arnhold and s bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job business was slack following the introduction of the interest equalization tax which undermined the viability of soross european trading he spent the years from  to  with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation in  he started a fund with  of the firms money to experiment with his trading strategies but he was principally motivated by a desire to assert himself as an investor to profit from his reflexivity insights in  soros set up the double eagle hedge fund with m of investors capital including  of his own money it was based in curaçao dutch antilles in  the double eagle fund had  million and formed the basis of the soros fund george soros and jim rogers received returns on their share of capital and  percent of the profits each year soros fund management in  soros founded soros fund management and became its chairman among those who held senior positions there at various times were jim rogers stanley druckenmiller mark schwartz keith anderson and soross two sons in  due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds soros resigned from the management of the double eagle fund he then established the soros fund and gave investors in the double eagle fund the option of transferring to that or staying with arnhold and s bleichroeder it was later renamed as the quantum fund named after the physical theory of quantum mechanics by that time the value of the fund had grown to m only a small proportion of which was soross own money he and jim rogers reinvested their returns from the fund and also a large part of their  performance fees thereby expanding their stake by  the fund had grown to m and then a  loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to m in july  soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors money valued at  billion and instead invested funds from his  billion family fortune due to changes in us securities and exchange commission disclosure rules which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors the fund had at that time averaged over  per year compound returns in  the quantum fund made  billion making it again the most successful hedge fund in history since its inception in  the fund has generated  billion the fund announced that it would inject  million to help finance the expansion of fen hotels an argentine hotel company the funds will develop  rooms over the next three years throughout various latin american countries  pound short soros had been building a huge position in pounds sterling for months leading up to september  soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the united kingdom in the european exchange rate mechanism for soros the rate at which the united kingdom was brought into the european exchange rate mechanism was too high their inflation was also much too high triple the german rate and british interest rates were hurting their asset prices on september   black wednesday soross fund sold short more than  billion in pounds profiting from the uk governments reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other european exchange rate mechanism countries or float its currency finally the uk withdrew from the european exchange rate mechanism devaluing the pound soross profit on the bet was estimated at over  billion he was dubbed the man who broke the bank of england the estimated cost of black wednesday to the uk treasury was £ billion on october   the times quoted soros as saying our total position by black wednesday had to be worth almost  billion we planned to sell more than that in fact when norman lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly  billion to defend sterling we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell stanley druckenmiller who traded under soros originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated soross contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position in  during the asian financial crisis the prime minister of malaysia mahathir bin mohamad accused soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the association of southeast asian nations asean for welcoming myanmar as a member following on a history of antisemitic remarks mahathir made specific reference to soross jewish background it is a jew who triggered the currency plunge and implied soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger jewish conspiracy nine years later in  mahathir met with soros and afterward stated that he accepted that soros had not been responsible for the crisis in s the crisis of global capitalism open society endangered soros explained his role in the crisis as follows the financial crisis that originated in thailand in  was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity by the beginning of  it was clear to soros fund management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable we sold short the thai baht and the malaysian ringgit early in  with maturities ranging from six months to a year that is we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates thai baht and malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold subsequently prime minister mahathir of malaysia accused me of causing the crisis a wholly unfounded accusation we were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis on the contrary we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation much too soon as it turned out we left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that mahathir would impose capital controls he did so but much later in  economist paul krugman was critical of soross effect on financial markets nobody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit these new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name my proposed term is soroi in an interview regarding the lates recession soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the s according to soros market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been some kind of an ideological excess in soross view the markets moods—a mood of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimismpessimism with which the markets look at reality—actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially selfreinforcing but eventually unsustainable and selfdefeating boombust sequences or bubbles in reaction to the lates recession he founded the institute for new economic thinking in october  this is a think tank composed of international economic business and financial experts mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system société générale insider trade in  soros was contacted by a french financier named georges pébereau who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in société générale a leading french bank that was part of a privatization program something instituted by the new government under jacques chirac soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four french companies société générale as well as suez paribas and the compagnie générale délectricité in  the commission des opérations de bourse cob—the french stock exchange regulatory authority conducted an investigation of whether soross transaction in société générale should be considered insider trading soros had received no information from the société générale and had no insider knowledge of the business but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt initial investigations found soros innocent and no charges were brought forward however the case was reopened a few years later and the french supreme court confirmed the conviction on june   but reduced the penalty to € soros denied any wrongdoing saying news of the takeover was public knowledge and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover in december  he appealed to the european court of human rights on various grounds including that the year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing on the basis of article  of the european convention on human rights stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed the court agreed to hear the appeal in october  the court rejected his appeal in a – decision saying that soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws personal life soros has been married three times and divorced twice in  he married annaliese witschak annaliese was an ethnic german immigrant who had been orphaned during the war although she was not jewish she was well liked by soross parents as she

said my personal opinion is theres no alternative but to give kosovo independence soros has helped fund the nonprofit group called independent diplomat it represented kosovo the turkish republic of northern cyprus under military occupation by turkey since  somaliland and the polisario front of western sahara drug policy reform soros has funded worldwide efforts to promote drug policy reform in

rehabilitation programs as alternatives to prison for persons convicted of nonviolent drugrelated offenses in october  soros donated  million to support californias proposition  according to remarks in an interview in october  it is soross opinion that marijuana is less addictive but not appropriate for use by children and students he himself has not used marijuana for years soros has been a major financier of the drug policy alliance – an organization that promotes cannabis legalization – with roughly  million in annual contributions from one of his foundations death and dying the project on death in america active from  to  was one of the open society institutes projects which sought to understand and transform the culture and experience of dying and bereavement in  soros delivered a speech in which he reported that he had offered to help his mother a member of the hemlock society commit suicide in the same speech he also endorsed the oregon death with dignity act proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign political and economic views external video george soros the lecture series introduction  general theory of reflexivity  financial markets  open society  capitalism vs open society  all by the open society foundations reflexivity financial markets and economic theory soross writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a near to equilibrium or a far from equilibrium state he argues that when markets are rising or falling rapidly they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium and that the conventional economic theory of the market the efficient market hypothesis does not apply in these situations soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium static disequilibrium and nearequilibrium conditions he has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect reflexivity is based on three main ideas reflexivity is best observed under special conditions where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena examples of factors that may give rise to this bias include a equity leveraging or b the trendfollowing habits of speculators reflexivity appears intermittently since it is most likely to be revealed under certain conditions ie the character of the equilibrium process is best considered in terms of probabilities investors observation of and participation in the capital markets may at times influence valuations and fundamental conditions or outcomes a recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets lenders began to make more money available to more people in the s to buy houses more people bought houses with this larger amount of money thus increasing the prices of these houses lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans but that their equity backing the loans – the value of the houses had gone up because more money was chasing the same amount of housing relatively thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good and prices rose higher still this was further amplified by public policy in the us home loans were guaranteed by the federal government many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for firsttime home buyers and other financial subsidies such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation these further encouraged house purchases leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards the concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot soros theories were originally dismissed by economists but have received more attention after the  crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the journal of economic methodology the notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of complexity economics as developed at the santa fe institute although soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the s reflexivity in politics although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets he has also explored its effects in politics he has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the open society in the past were from communism and fascism as discussed in the open society and its enemies by his mentor karl popper the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism he has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the united states is a reflexive phenomenon insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable view of problems in the free market system soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries he blames many of the worlds problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism soros claims to draw a distinction between being a participant in the market and working to change the rules that market participants must follow market predictions soross book the new paradigm for financial markets may  described a superbubble that had built up over the past  years and was ready to collapse this was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster as he states i have a record of crying wolf i did it first in the alchemy of finance in  then in the crisis of global capitalism in  and now in this book so its three books predicting disaster after the boy cried wolf three times  the wolf really came he ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong im only rich because i know when im wrong i basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes i very often used to get backaches due to the fact that i was wrong whenever you are wrong you have to fight or take flight when i make the decision the backache goes away in february  soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated adding that there was no prospect of a nearterm resolution to the crisis we witnessed the collapse of the financial system it was placed on life support and its still on life support theres no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom in january  at an economic forum in sri lanka soros predicted a financial crisis akin to  based on the state of global currency stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking chinese yuan china has a major adjustment problem i would say it amounts to a crisis when i look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in  views on antisemitism and israel when asked about what he thought about israel in the new yorker soros replied that i dont deny the jews to a right to a national existence – but i dont want anything to do with it according to hacked emails released in  soros open society foundation has a selfdescribed objective of “challenging israel’s racist and antidemocratic policies” in international forums in part by questioning israel’s reputation as a democracy he has funded ngos which have been actively critical of israeli policies including groups that campaign for the boycott divestment and sanctions movement against israel soros has been accused of saying that both jews and israel are partially responsible for antisemitism in response to his statement that the administrations of gw bush in the us and ariel sharon in israel were stoking antisemitism he has also said that jews cant overcome antisemitism without giving up on the tribalness on november   at a jewish forum in new york city soros partially attributed a recent resurgence of antisemitism to the policies of israel and the united states and the role of wealthy and influential individuals there is a resurgence of antisemitism in europe the policies of the bush administration and the sharon administration contribute to that its not specifically antisemitism but it does manifest itself in antisemitism as well im critical of those policies if we change that direction then antisemitism also will diminish i cant see how one could confront it directly im also very concerned about my own role because the new antisemitism holds that the jews rule the world as an unintended consequence of my actions i also contribute to that image in a subsequent article for the new york review of books soros emphasized that i do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of israel and i am not blaming jews for antisemitism antisemitism predates the birth of israel neither israels policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for antisemitism at the same time i do believe that attitudes toward israel are influenced by israels policies and attitudes toward the jewish community are influenced by the proisrael lobbys success in suppressing divergent views during a  billion lawsuit against soros by beny steinmetzs israeli company bsg resources which alleged soros used his sway with the government of guinea to freeze the israeli company out of iron ore mining contracts  the lawsuit alleges that soros hostility to israel is a motive for his actions to soros steinmetz’s success as well as his active passionate promotion of israeli life business and culture are anathema” bsgr said in the lawsuit “soros is also well known for his longstanding animus toward the state of israel during an award ceremony for imre kertész soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming “perpetrators of violence” suggesting that this model explained israels behaviour towards the palestinians which led to walkouts and soros being booed in july  israels ministry of foreign affairs released a statement denouncing soros a move that appeared designed to align israel more closely with hungary ahead of a visit to budapest by prime minister benjamin netanyahu israels foreign ministry stated the soros continuously undermines israels democratically elected governments adding that soros funded organizations that defame the jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself views on the us on november   in an interview with the washington post soros said that removing president george w bush from office was the central focus of my life and a matter of life and death he said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat bush if someone guaranteed it soros gave  million to the center for american progress  million to moveonorg and  million to america coming together these groups worked to support democrats in the  election on september   he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech why we must not reelect president bush delivered at the national press club in washington dc the online transcript to this speech received many hits after dick cheney accidentally referred to factcheckorg as factcheckcom in the vice presidential debate causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to soross site his  book the bubble of american supremacy was a forthright critique of the bush administrations war on terror as misconceived and counterproductive and a polemic against the reelection of bush he explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the selfreinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices when soros was asked in  about his statement in the age of fallibility that the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the united states he responded that it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world and i think thats rather shocking for americans to hear the united states sets the agenda for the world and the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda by declaring a war on terror after september  we set the wrong agenda for the world when you wage war you inevitably create innocent victims soros described donald trump as a con man soros expects trump to fail because soros believes trumps ideas are selfcontradictory soros believes trump is preparing for a trade war and expects financial markets to do badly views on europe in october  soros drafted an open letter entitled as concerned europeans we urge eurozone leaders to unite in which he calls for a stronger economic government for europe using federal means common eu treasury common fiscal supervision etc and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the economic crisis the letter was cosigned by javier solana daniel cohnbendit andrew duff emma bonino massimo dalema vaira vikefreiberga soros criticized hungarian prime minister viktor orbán and his handling of the european migrant crisis in  his plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle soros expects that brexit will fail and the premiership of theresa may will last only a short time views on asia soros has expressed concern about the growth of chinese economic and political power saying china has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests they have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well regarding the political gridlock in america he said today china has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the united states in july  soros stated that a strategic partnership between the us and china could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict in january  during an interview at the world economic forum wef in davos soros stated that a hard landing is practically unavoidable chinese state media responded by stating soros’ challenge to the rmb and hong kong dollar are doomed to fail without any doubt views on russia and ukraine in may  soros told cnns fareed zakaria i set up a foundation in ukraine before ukraine became independent from russia and the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now in january  soros said that europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from russia he also urged western countries to expand economic sanctions against russia for its support of separatists in eastern ukraine in january  soros called on the european union to give  billion of bailout money to ukraine in july  soros stated that putins annexation of crimea was a challenge to the prevailing world order specifically the european union he hypothesized that putin wants to destabilize all of ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern ukraine which would then depend on russia for economic support in november  russia banned the open society foundations osf and the open society institute osi two prodemocracy charities founded by soros—stating they posed as threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the russian federation and the security of the state in january   books related to soros renewal of humanitarian education program were burned at vorkuta mining and economic college in the komi republic with  additional books seized for shredding a russian intergovernmental letter released in december  stated that soros charities were forming a perverted perception of history and making ideological directives alien to russian ideology popular wealth and philanthropy for more details on george soros philanthropy see list of projects

movements behind the iron curtain soross philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote nonviolent democratization in the postsoviet states these efforts mostly in central and eastern europe occur primarily through the open society foundations originally open society institute or osi and national soros foundations which sometimes go under other names such as the stefan batory foundation in poland as of  pbs estimated that he had given away a total of  billion the osi says it has spent about  million annually in recent years in  former federal reserve chairman paul volcker wrote in the foreword of soross book the alchemy of finance george soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game the bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become open societies open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but—more important—tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior time magazine in  cited two specific projects— million toward internet infrastructure for regional russian universities and  million for the millennium promise to eradicate extreme poverty in africa—noting that soros had given  million to projects in the us and given away a total of more than  billion other notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern europe help to civilians during the siege of sarajevo and transparency international soros also pledged an endowment of € million to the central european university ceu the nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus and his microfinance bank grameen bank received support from the osicitation needed according to national review online the open society institute gave  in september  to the defense committee of lynne stewart the lawyer who has defended controversial poor and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to ⅓ years in prison for providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy via a press conference for a client an osi spokeswoman said it appeared to us at that time that there was a righttocounsel issue worthy of our support but claimed later requests for support were declined in september  soros pledged  million to the millennium promise led by economist jeffrey sachs to provide educational agricultural and medical aid to help villages in africa enduring poverty the new york times termed this endeavor a departure for soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government but soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance soros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in hungary – and provided a substantial endowment to central european university in budapest the open society foundations has active programs in more than  countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately

interviews  external links early life and education soros was born in budapest in the kingdom of hungary to a welltodo nonobservant jewish family who like many uppermiddle class hungarian jews at the time were uncomfortable with their roots soros has described his home as antisemitic his mother erzsébet also known as elizabeth came from a family that owned a thriving silk shop his father tivadar also known as teodoro was a lawyer and had been a prisoner of war during and after world war i until he escaped from russia and rejoined his family in budapest the two married in  tivadar was an esperantist writer and taught soros to speak esperanto in his childhood in  soross family changed their name from the germanjewish schwartz to soros as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic hungary tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning in hungarian soros means next in line or designated successor in esperanto it means will soar soros was  years old in march  when nazi germany occupied hungary jewish children were barred from attending school by the nazis and soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the judenrat jewish council which had been established during the occupation soros later described this time to writer michael lewis the jewish council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices i was told to go to the jewish council and there i was given these small slips of paper i took this piece of paper to my father he instantly recognized it this was a list of hungarian jewish lawyers he said you deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported soros did not return to that job his family purchased documents to say that they were christians thereby allowing them to survive the war later that year at age  soros posed as the christian godson of an official of the collaborationist hungarian governments ministry of agriculture who himself had a jewish wife in hiding on one occasion rather than leave the  year old alone the official took soros with him while he inventoried a rich jewish familys estate though soros did not take part tivadar not only saved his immediate family but also many other hungarian jews and george would later write that  had been the happiest year of his life for it had given him the opportunity to witness his fathers heroism in  soros survived the siege of budapest in which soviet and german forces fought house to house through the city in  soros immigrated to england and became a student at the london school of economics while a student of the philosopher karl popper soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter soros received £ from a quaker charity in a discussion at the los angeles world affairs council in  alvin shuster former foreign editor of the los angeles times asked soros how does one go from an immigrant to a financier  when did you realize that you knew how to make money soros replied well i had a variety of jobs and i ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside souvenir shops and i thought thats really not what i was cut out to do so i wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in london got just one or two replies and eventually thats how i got a job in a merchant bank that job was an entrylevel position in singer  friedlander soros earned a bachelor of science in philosophy in  and a master of science in philosophy in  both from the london school of economics investment career early business experience after graduating soros found it difficult to get work and settled for a job as a traveling salesman for a fancygoods wholesaler selling to retailers in welsh seaside resorts he described this period as the low point of my life and wrote letters to a number of merchant banks requesting interviews many of these ignored him and others humiliated him in the interviews he credits his acceptance at singer and friedlander to the fact that the managing director was a fellow hungarian singer and friedlander in  soros began his financial career at the merchant bank singer  friedlander of london he worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department a fellow employee robert mayer suggested he apply at his fathers brokerage house fm mayer of new york fm mayer in  soros moved to new york city where he worked as an arbitrage trader for fm mayer – he specialized in european stocks which were becoming popular with us institutional investors following the formation of the coal and steel community which later became the common market wertheim and co in  after three years at fm mayer he moved to wertheim  co as an analyst of european securities where he stayed until  he planned to stay for five years enough time to save  after which he intended to return to england to study philosophy during this period soros developed the theory of reflexivity based on the ideas of karl popper reflexivity posited that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation reflexive feedback loops are created where ideas influence events and events influence ideas soros further argued that this leads to markets having procyclical virtuous or vicious cycles of boom and bust in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics arnhold and s bleichroeder from  to  soross experience as a vice president at arnhold and s bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job business was slack following the introduction of the interest equalization tax which undermined the viability of soross european trading he spent the years from  to  with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation in  he started a fund with  of the firms money to experiment with his trading strategies but he was principally motivated by a desire to assert himself as an investor to profit from his reflexivity insights in  soros set up the double eagle hedge fund with m of investors capital including  of his own money it was based in curaçao dutch antilles in  the double eagle fund had  million and formed the basis of the soros fund george soros and jim rogers received returns on their share of capital and  percent of the profits each year soros fund management in  soros founded soros fund management and became its chairman among those who held senior positions there at various times were jim rogers stanley druckenmiller mark schwartz keith anderson and soross two sons in  due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds soros resigned from the management of the double eagle fund he then established the soros fund and gave investors in the double eagle fund the option of transferring to that or staying with arnhold and s bleichroeder it was later renamed as the quantum fund named after the physical theory of quantum mechanics by that time the value of the fund had grown to m only a small proportion of which was soross own money he and jim rogers reinvested their returns from the fund and also a large part of their  performance fees thereby expanding their stake by  the fund had grown to m and then a  loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to m in july  soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors money valued at  billion and instead invested funds from his  billion family fortune due to changes in us securities and exchange commission disclosure rules which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors the fund had at that time averaged over  per year compound returns in  the quantum fund made  billion making it again the most successful hedge fund in history since its inception in  the fund has generated  billion the fund announced that it would inject  million to help finance the expansion of fen hotels an argentine hotel company the funds will develop  rooms over the next three years throughout various latin american countries  pound short soros had been building a huge position in pounds sterling for months leading up to september  soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the united kingdom in the european exchange rate mechanism for soros the rate at which the united kingdom was brought into the european exchange rate mechanism was too high their inflation was also much too high triple the german rate and british interest rates were hurting their asset prices on september   black wednesday soross fund sold short more than  billion in pounds profiting from the uk governments reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other european exchange rate mechanism countries or float its currency finally the uk withdrew from the european exchange rate mechanism devaluing the pound soross profit on the bet was estimated at over  billion he was dubbed the man who broke the bank of england the estimated cost of black wednesday to the uk treasury was £ billion on october   the times quoted soros as saying our total position by black wednesday had to be worth almost  billion we planned to sell more than that in fact when norman lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly  billion to defend sterling we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell stanley druckenmiller who traded under soros originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated soross contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position in  during the asian financial crisis the prime minister of malaysia mahathir bin mohamad accused soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the association of southeast asian nations asean for welcoming myanmar as a member following on a history of antisemitic remarks mahathir made specific reference to soross jewish background it is a jew who triggered the currency plunge and implied soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger jewish conspiracy nine years later in  mahathir met with soros and afterward stated that he accepted that soros had not been responsible for the crisis in s the crisis of global capitalism open society endangered soros explained his role in the crisis as follows the financial crisis that originated in thailand in  was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity by the beginning of  it was clear to soros fund management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable we sold short the thai baht and the malaysian ringgit early in  with maturities ranging from six months to a year that is we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates thai baht and malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold subsequently prime minister mahathir of malaysia accused me of causing the crisis a wholly unfounded accusation we were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis on the contrary we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation much too soon as it turned out we left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that mahathir would impose capital controls he did so but much later in  economist paul krugman was critical of soross effect on financial markets nobody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit these new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name my proposed term is soroi in an interview regarding the lates recession soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the s according to soros market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been some kind of an ideological excess in soross view the markets moods—a mood of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimismpessimism with which the markets look at reality—actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially selfreinforcing but eventually unsustainable and selfdefeating boombust sequences or bubbles in reaction to the lates recession he founded the institute for new economic thinking in october  this is a think tank composed of international economic business and financial experts mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system société générale insider trade in  soros was contacted by a french financier named georges pébereau who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in société générale a leading french bank that was part of a privatization program something instituted by the new government under jacques chirac soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four french companies société générale as well as suez paribas and the compagnie générale délectricité in  the commission des opérations de bourse cob—the french stock exchange regulatory authority conducted an investigation of whether soross transaction in société générale should be considered insider trading soros had received no information from the société générale and had no insider knowledge of the business but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt initial investigations found soros innocent and no charges were brought forward however the case was reopened a few years later and the french supreme court confirmed the conviction on june   but reduced the penalty to € soros denied any wrongdoing saying news of the takeover was public knowledge and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover in december  he appealed to the european court of human rights on various grounds including that the year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing on the basis of article  of the european convention on human rights stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed the court agreed to hear the appeal in october  the court rejected his appeal in a – decision saying that soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws personal life soros has been married three times and divorced twice in  he married annaliese witschak annaliese was an ethnic german immigrant who had been

transform the culture and experience of dying and bereavement in  soros delivered a speech in which he reported that he had offered to help his mother a member of the hemlock society commit suicide in the same speech he also endorsed the oregon death with dignity act proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign political and economic views external video george soros the lecture series introduction  general theory of reflexivity  financial markets  open society  capitalism vs open society  all by the open society foundations reflexivity financial markets and economic theory soross writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a near to equilibrium or a far from equilibrium state he argues that when markets are rising or falling rapidly they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium and that the conventional economic theory of the market the efficient market hypothesis does not apply in these situations soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium static disequilibrium and nearequilibrium conditions he has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect reflexivity is based on three main ideas reflexivity is best observed under special conditions where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena examples of factors that may give rise to this bias include a equity leveraging or b the trendfollowing habits of speculators reflexivity appears intermittently since it is most likely to be revealed under certain conditions ie the character of the equilibrium process is best considered in terms of probabilities investors observation of and participation in the capital markets may at times influence valuations and fundamental conditions or outcomes a recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets lenders began to make more money available to more people in the s to buy houses more people bought houses with this larger amount of money thus increasing the prices of these houses lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans but that their equity backing the loans – the value of the houses had gone up because more money was chasing the same amount of housing relatively thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good and prices rose higher still this was further amplified by public policy in the us home loans were guaranteed by the federal government many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for firsttime home buyers and other financial subsidies such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation these further encouraged house purchases leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards the concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot soros theories were originally dismissed by economists but have received more attention after the  crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the journal of economic methodology the notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of complexity economics as developed at the santa fe institute although soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the s reflexivity in politics although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets he has also explored its effects in politics he has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the open society in the past were from communism and fascism as discussed in the open society and its enemies by his mentor karl popper the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism he has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the united states is a reflexive phenomenon insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable view of problems in the free market system soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries he blames many of the worlds problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism soros claims to draw a distinction between being a participant in the market and working to change the rules that market participants must follow market predictions soross book the new paradigm for financial markets may  described a superbubble that had built up over the past  years and was ready to collapse this was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster as he states i have a record of crying wolf i did it first in the alchemy of finance in  then in the crisis of global capitalism in  and now in this book so its three books predicting disaster after the boy cried wolf three times  the wolf really came he ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong im only rich because i know when im wrong i basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes i very often used to get backaches due to the fact that i was wrong whenever you are wrong you have to fight or take flight when i make the decision the backache goes away in february  soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated adding that there was no prospect of a nearterm resolution to the crisis we witnessed the collapse of the financial system it was placed on life support and its still on life support theres no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom in january  at an economic forum in sri lanka soros predicted a financial crisis akin to  based on the state of global currency stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking chinese yuan china has a major adjustment problem i would say it amounts to a crisis when i look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in  views on antisemitism and israel when asked about what he thought about israel in the new yorker soros replied that i dont deny the jews to a right to a national existence – but i dont want anything to do with it according to hacked emails released in  soros open society foundation has a selfdescribed objective of “challenging israel’s racist and antidemocratic policies” in international forums in part by questioning israel’s reputation as a democracy he has funded ngos which have been actively critical of israeli policies including groups that campaign for the boycott divestment and sanctions movement against israel soros has been accused of saying that both jews and israel are partially responsible for antisemitism in response to his statement that the administrations of gw bush in the us and ariel sharon in israel were stoking antisemitism he has also said that jews cant overcome antisemitism without giving up on the tribalness on november   at a jewish forum in new york city soros partially attributed a recent resurgence of antisemitism to the policies of israel and the united states and the role of wealthy and influential individuals there is a resurgence of antisemitism in europe the policies of the bush administration and the sharon administration contribute to that its not specifically antisemitism but it does manifest itself in antisemitism as well im critical of those policies if we change that direction then antisemitism also will diminish i cant see how one could confront it directly im also very concerned about my own role because the new antisemitism holds that the jews rule the world as an unintended consequence of my actions i also contribute to that image in a subsequent article for the new york review of books soros emphasized that i do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of israel and i am not blaming jews for antisemitism antisemitism predates the birth of israel neither israels policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for antisemitism at the same time i do believe that attitudes toward israel are influenced by israels policies and attitudes toward the jewish community are influenced by the proisrael lobbys success in suppressing divergent views during a  billion lawsuit against soros by beny steinmetzs israeli company bsg resources which alleged soros used his sway with the government of guinea to freeze the israeli company out of iron ore mining contracts  the lawsuit alleges that soros hostility to israel is a motive for his actions to soros steinmetz’s success as well as his active passionate promotion of israeli life business and culture are anathema” bsgr said in the lawsuit “soros is also well known for his longstanding animus toward the state of israel during an award ceremony for imre kertész soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming “perpetrators of violence” suggesting that this model explained israels behaviour towards the palestinians which led to walkouts and soros being booed in july  israels ministry of foreign affairs released a statement denouncing soros a move that appeared designed to align israel more closely with hungary ahead of a visit to budapest by prime minister benjamin netanyahu israels foreign ministry stated the soros continuously undermines israels democratically elected governments adding that soros funded organizations that defame the jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself views on the us on november   in an interview with the washington post soros said that removing president george w bush from office was the central focus of my life and a matter of life and death he said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat bush if someone guaranteed it soros gave  million to the center for american progress  million to moveonorg and  million to america coming together these groups worked to support democrats in the  election on september   he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech why we must not reelect president bush delivered at the national press club in washington dc the online transcript to this speech received many hits after dick cheney accidentally referred to factcheckorg as factcheckcom in the vice presidential debate causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to soross site his  book the bubble of american supremacy was a forthright critique of the bush administrations war on terror as misconceived and counterproductive and a polemic against the reelection of bush he explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the selfreinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices when soros was asked in  about his statement in the age of fallibility that the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the united states he responded that it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world and i think thats rather shocking for americans to hear the united states sets the agenda for the world and the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda by declaring a war on terror after september  we set the wrong agenda for the world when you wage war you inevitably create innocent victims soros described donald trump as a con man soros expects trump to fail because soros believes trumps ideas are selfcontradictory soros believes trump is preparing for a trade war and expects financial markets to do badly views on europe in october  soros drafted an open letter entitled as concerned europeans we urge eurozone leaders to unite in which he calls for a stronger economic government for europe using federal means common eu treasury common fiscal supervision etc and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the economic crisis the letter was cosigned by javier solana daniel cohnbendit andrew duff emma bonino massimo dalema vaira vikefreiberga soros criticized hungarian prime minister viktor orbán and his handling of the european migrant crisis in  his plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle soros expects that brexit will fail and the premiership of theresa may will last only a short time views on asia soros has expressed concern about the growth of chinese economic and political power saying china has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests they have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well regarding the political gridlock in america he said today china has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the united states in july  soros stated that a strategic partnership between the us and china could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict in january  during an interview at the world economic forum wef in davos soros stated that a hard landing is practically unavoidable chinese state media responded by stating soros’ challenge to the rmb and hong kong dollar are doomed to fail without any doubt views on russia and ukraine in may  soros told cnns fareed zakaria i set up a foundation in ukraine before ukraine became independent from russia and the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now in january  soros said that europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from russia he also urged western countries to expand economic sanctions against russia for its support of separatists in eastern ukraine in january  soros called on the european union to give  billion of bailout money to ukraine in july  soros stated that putins annexation of crimea was a challenge to the prevailing world order specifically the european union he hypothesized that putin wants to destabilize all of ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern ukraine which would then depend on russia for economic support in november  russia banned the open society foundations osf and the open society institute osi two prodemocracy charities founded by soros—stating they posed as threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the russian federation and the security of the state in january   books related to soros renewal of humanitarian education program were burned at vorkuta mining and economic college in the komi republic with  additional books seized for shredding a russian intergovernmental letter released in december  stated that soros charities were forming a perverted perception of history and making ideological directives alien to russian ideology popular wealth and philanthropy for more details on george soros philanthropy see list of projects supported by george soros george soros speaks to the lse alumni

began providing funds to help black students attend the university of cape town in apartheid south africa and began funding dissident movements behind the iron curtain soross philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote nonviolent democratization in the postsoviet states these efforts mostly in central and eastern europe occur primarily through the open society foundations originally open society institute or osi and national soros foundations which sometimes go under other names such as the stefan batory foundation in poland as of  pbs estimated that he had given away a total of  billion the osi says it has spent about  million annually in recent years in  former federal reserve chairman paul volcker wrote in the foreword of soross book the alchemy of finance george soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game the bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become open societies open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but—more important—tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior time magazine in  cited two specific projects— million toward internet infrastructure for regional russian universities and  million for the millennium promise to eradicate extreme poverty in africa—noting that soros had given  million to projects in the us and given away a total of more than  billion other notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern europe help to civilians during the siege of sarajevo and transparency international soros also pledged an endowment of € million to the central european university ceu the nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus and his microfinance bank grameen bank received support from the osicitation needed according to national review online the open society institute gave  in september  to the defense committee of lynne stewart the lawyer who has defended controversial poor and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to ⅓ years in prison for providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy via a press conference for a client an osi spokeswoman said it appeared to us at that time that there was a righttocounsel issue worthy of our support but claimed later requests for support were declined in september  soros pledged  million to the millennium promise led by economist jeffrey sachs to provide educational agricultural and medical aid to help villages in africa enduring poverty the new york times termed this endeavor a departure for soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government but soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance soros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in hungary – and provided a substantial endowment to central european university in budapest the open society foundations has active programs in more than  countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately  million a year legacy and awards soros received honorary doctoral degrees from the

sorosrevolution april   image source by brandon turbeville while baltimore burns the city has proven itself to be yet another staging ground in a long line of scenes involving “violent protests” riots and racial violence following an incident concerning police brutality real or otherwise although the issues that have set off the spark in most of these protests were entirely legitimate government agencies foundations organizations and ngos immediately swooped in to divert the protests into racially charged fit throwing and often violent riots with a carefully orchestrated network that was capable of organizing large numbers of individuals on a moment’s notice and a simultaneous media campaign that cleverly showed violence and riots but ignored peaceful or appropriatelydirected violent acts these organizations were able to turn what could and should have been a national movement into a raciallyoriented hatefilled display of unrestrained destruction with this in mind one might justifiably ask how these organizations might have such an effective network that operates in concert with a national corporate media apparatus in order to wreck legitimate movements and out of those movements create a counterproductive act of mindless fitthrowing the answer is the same as it has often been in europe – the color revolution apparatus and george soros indeed george soros has been heavily involved in the social unrest and movementwrecking activity that has taken place all across the united states in recent months from florida to ferguson and now to baltimore george soros’ foundations have been involved in making sure that not only are american citizens unable to overcome racial divisions with mutual cooperation but that even the racially isolated participants are unable to accomplish anything of substance as kelly riddell of the washington times reported in january  regarding soros’ involvement in ferguson there’s a solitary man at the financial center of the ferguson protest movement no it’s not victim michael brown or officer darren wilson it’s not even the rev al sharpton despite his ubiquitous campaign on tv and the streets  rather it’s liberal billionaire george soros who has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit foundations that impacts american politics and policy not unlike what he did with moveonorg  mr soros spurred the ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the us according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by the washington times  in all mr soros gave at least  million in one year to support alreadyestablished groups that emboldened the grassroots ontheground activists in ferguson according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit open society foundations  the financial tether from mr soros to the activist groups gave rise to a combustible protest movement that transformed a oneday criminal event in missouri into a houraday national cause celebre  “our dna includes a belief that having people participate in government is indispensable to living in a more just inclusive democratic society” said kenneth zimmerman director of mr soros‘ open society foundations’ us programs in an interview with the washington times “helping groups combine policy research and data collection with community organizing feels very much the way our society becomes more accountable” indeed the open society institute has been promoting “democracy” all over the world if by democracy one means the overthrow of governments unfriendly to angloamerican banking interests and installing new and more corrupt leadership in its place riddell continues by writing sorossponsored organizations helped mobilize protests in ferguson building grassroots coalitions on the ground backed by a nationwide online and social media campaign  other sorosfunded groups made it their job to remotely monitor and exploit anything related to the incident that they could portray as a conservative misstep and to develop academic research and editorials to disseminate to the news media to keep the story alive  the plethora of organizations involved not only shared mr soros‘ funding but they also fed off each other using content and buzzwords developed by one organization on another’s website referencing each other’s news columns and by creating a social media echo chamber of facebook “likes” and twitter hashtags that dominated the mainstream media and personal online newsfeeds  buses of activists from the samuel dewitt proctor conference in chicago from the drug policy alliance make the road new york and equal justice usa from new york from sojourners the advancement project and center for community change in washington and networks from the gamaliel foundation — all funded in part by mr soros — descended on ferguson starting in august and later organized protests and gatherings in the city until late last month  all were aimed at keeping the media’s attention on the city and to widen the scope of the incident to focus on interrelated causes — not just the overpolicing and racial discrimination narratives that were highlighted by the news media in august  “i went to ferguson in a quest to be in solidarity and stand with the young organizers and affirm their leadership” said kassandra frederique policy manager at the drug policy alliance which was founded by mr soros and which receives  million annually from his foundation she traveled to ferguson in october  “we recognized this movement is similar to the work we’re doing at dpa” said ms frederique “the war on drugs has always been to operationalize institutionalize and criminalize people of color protecting personal sovereignty is a cornerstone of the work we do and what this movement is all about”  ms frederique works with opal tometi cocreator of blacklivesmatter — a hashtag that was developed after the killing of trayvon martin in florida — and helped promote it on dpa’s news feeds ms tometi runs the black alliance for just immigration a group to which mr soros gave  in  according to the most recent of his foundation’s tax filings  “i think blacklivesmatter’s success is because of organizing this was created after trayvon martin and there has been sustained organizing and conversations about police violence since then” said ms frederique “its explosion into the mainstream recently is because it connects all the dots at a time when everyone was lost for words ‘black lives matter’ is liberating unapologetic and leaves no room for confusion” it should be noted that the gamaliel foundation which is described as a “network of grassroots and interracial organizations” is not only funded by george soros it was the foundation where president barack obama began his career as a “community organizer” in chicago obama’s former pastor rev jeremiah wright who drew conservative ire for a fiery sermon condemning america’s actions his famous “goddamn america speech is a trustee of the sorosfunded samuel dewitt proctor conference an organization that sent representatives to ferguson early on in ferguson the use of clergy and ministers became a major part of the social movement as funded by soros as well riddell reveals as much when she writes representatives of sojourners a national evangelical christian organization committed “to faith in action for social justice” attended the weekend gamaliel’s weekend protest event in ferguson the group received  from mr soros in   clergy representatives from the samuel dewitt proctor conference where the rev jeremiah wright serves as a trustee also showed up mr wright was mr obama’s pastor in chicago before some of his racially charged sermons including the phrase “god damn america” forced mr obama to distance himself sdpc received  from mr soros in   during gamaliel’s weekend protest event sunday was deemed “hands up sabbath” where clergy were asked to speak out about racial issues using packets and talking points prepared for them by another religionbased community organizing group pico pico is also supported by the open society foundations according to its website the washington times article also serves to shed light on a number of other more profile “national” organizations funded by soros that descended upon ferguson now explaining some of the reasons that the protest movement on the ground in mo became such a disgraceful failure riddell further demonstrates this by writing larry fellows iii  a missouri native did find his voice in the chaos of ferguson with the help of outside assistance backed by mr soros  mr fellows is cofounder of the millennial activists united a key source of video and stories developed in ferguson by youth activists used to inspire other groups nationally mr fellows explained how he started his organization in an interview with the american civil liberties union another sorosbacked entity that sent national representatives to missouri in november  “initially it would just be that we would show up for protests and the next day we’d clean up the streets a lot of the same people were out at the protests and going out to lunch and talking about what was happening that became a cycle until a lot of us figured out we needed to have a strategy” mr fellows explained to the aclu which posted the interview in its blog  “then a lot of organizers from across the country started to come in to help us do the planning and do the strategizing that helped us start doing it on our own and planning out actions and what our narratives were going to be” he said  mau has listed on its website that it has partnered with gamaliel network churches they’ve also received training on civil disobedience from the advancement project — which was given a  grant from mr soros in  “to build a fair and just multiracial democracy in america through litigation community organizing support public policy reform and strategic communications” according to the foundation’s website  the advancement project based in washington also arranged the meeting between community organizers in ferguson and mr obama last month to brief him on the situation in ferguson and to set up a task force that examines trust between police and minority communities  in addition the advancement project has also dedicated some of its staff to lead organizations in ferguson like the don’t shoot coalition another grassroots group that preaches the same message links to the same facebook posts and “likes” the same articles as dpa aclu hands up coalition obs more and others it should also be noted that the open society institute one of soros’ main ngos has worked closely with mayor rawlingsblake and google in making baltimore one of their “test cities” for smart technology and new fiber cables rawlingsblake has had pleasant things to say about soros in the past while the above information addresses the involvement of blacklivesmatter groups and similar organizations active on the ground inside ferguson as a matter of historical precedent these organizations and similar operations such as the black youth project funded by soros and the open society institute and its subsididiaries have had a sizable presence inside baltimore in the time leading up to the freddie gray protests and continue to do so as we speak for instance baltimore united viewfinders has received a sizeable grant from the osi for the purpose of working with a coalition of community partners and the maryland institute college of art to use digital media to engage east baltimore youth in peertopeer arts and social justice programming other organizations and individuals have received grants from the osi to promote “social justice” and “democracy” through theatre and the arts while others operate on a more charitable basis providing guidance in healthcare matters and community organizing skills as one will see from the discussion of the methodology of color revolutions below as well as the discussion of the preparation that goes into these social phenomena the structure of “community organizations” and “community influence” is important to the color revolution apparatus the ability to take advantage of unemployed undereducated lonely and hopeless youth is one of the greatest opportunities that the soros color revolution organizations understand and firmly grasp the relevance of the soros connection may seem confusing to many certainly however no one in their right mind will suggest that a man that has made his fortune bankrupting nations and impoverishing their peoples lies awake at night wringing his hands over concerns for black people in america soros is most wellknown for playing a major role in the funding and facilitating of the “bulldozer revolution” in serbia that overthrew slobodan milosevic in  georgia’s “rose revolution” of  the  push to move turkey toward a more islamist governing structure and even the occupy movement in the united states among a great many others – none of which brought anything other than greater misery impoverishment and police state mechanisms to bear on the general public the occupy movement being the only exception still brought nothing to its participants except the opportunity to burn off excess anger and energy along with a few cracked protester skulls it was otherwise an incredible waste of time regardless the methods being used by the soros machine in terms of the blacklivesmatter and other related campaigns across the country are much the same as those used in europe to usher in greater austerity police states and fascism through governmentcoup and social protest – ie a coordinated media campaign to provide the general public with a false perception of events as well as a false narrative the use of social media and slogans and the deployment of “swarming adolescents” in the streets when media campaigns alone are not enough there are other methods that are able to be implemented if need be for instance a mother jones report revealed the fact that in some areas where rioting began there appears to have been a concerted effort on the part of the authorities to create an environment in which riots would be inevitable for example in an instance where it was reported that teens in baltimore attacked police by throwing rocks it was never mentioned that police had corralled these teens – who should have been on their way home – off the bus and into an area in between the mall and the high school according to onlookers it appeared that both the teens and the police were surprised at the situation – the police surprised at the lack of violence and the teens surprised that they were kept from going home eventually rocks and bottles were reportedly thrown at police and the situation deteriorated from there of course the entire story was never fully reported in the mainstream press still while the rocks and bottles may have started from those in the crowd others may justifiably wonder if there were not provocateurs already placed simply waiting to cause violence as soon as the tension had reached a boiling point as it is it is very likely that protesters and police alike were dupes in a devious game consider also the fact that the baltimore authorities despite implementing heavyhanded tactics against high schoolers on their way home allowed criminals thieves and violent thugs to prey upon innocent people private property and communities for quite some time without a serious effort to stop them in fact baltimore mayor stephanie rawlingsblake even openly admitted that the looters were allowed to riot when she stated that “we also gave those who wish to destroy space to do that as well” the police were prevented from actually stopping the riots and were kept largely unequipped as well in other words the riots were both allowed and encouraged until they had reached a boiling point and the national guard was called in of course the color revolution and destabilization is not merely some communiqué presented to a small group of people that organically takes on a life of its own there is an entire science behind the application of a movement of destabilization both when it takes place overseas as well as when it takes place domestically as pottenger and frieson of color revolutions and geopolitics write many are the professions that utilize this type of understanding including but not limited to marketing advertising public relations politics and lawmaking radio television journalism and news film music general business and salesmanship each of them selling branding promoting entertaining sloganeering framing explaining creating friends and enemies arguing likes and dislikes setting the boundaries of good and evil in many cases using their talents to circumvent their audiences’ intellect the real target being emotional oftentimes even subconscious looking beneath the facade of the color revolutionary movement we also find a desirebased behavioral structure in particular one that has been built upon historical lessons offered by social movements and periods of political upheaval it then makes sense that the personnel of such operations include perception managers pr firms pollsters and opinionmakers in the social media through the operational infrastructure these entities work in close coordination with intelligence agents local and foreign activists strategists and tacticians taxexempt foundations governmental agencies and a host of non governmental organizations collectively their job is to make a palace coup of their sponsorship seem like a social revolution to help fill the streets with fearless demonstrators advocating on behalf of a government of their choosing which then legitimizes the sham governments with the authenticity of popular democracy and revolutionary fervor  lumen military grade led flashlight ad because the operatives perform much of their craft in the open their effectiveness is heavily predicated upon their ability to veil the influence backing them and the longterm intentions guiding their work their effectiveness is predicated on their ability to deceive targeting both local populations and foreign audiences with highlymisleading interpretations of the underlying causes provoking these events with this explanation in mind consider the description provided by ian traynor of the guardian regarding the “revolutions” and “mass movements” which was taking place in ukraine serbia belarus and georgia in  and the time of the writing of his article indeed traynor’s depiction of the methodology used by the foundations ngos and government agencies stirring up dissent and popular revolt is equally illuminating traynor writes in the centre of belgrade there is a dingy office staffed by computerliterate youngsters who call themselves the centre for nonviolent resistance if you want to know how to beat a regime that controls the mass media the judges the courts the security apparatus and the voting stations the young belgrade activists are for hire  they emerged from the antimilosevic student movement otpor meaning resistance the catchy singleword branding is important in georgia last year the parallel student movement was khmara in belarus it was zubr in ukraine it is pora meaning high time otpor also had a potent simple slogan that appeared everywhere in serbia in  – the two words “gotov je” meaning “he’s finished” a reference to milosevic a logo of a blackandwhite clenched fist completed the masterful marketing in ukraine the equivalent is a ticking clock also signalling that the kuchma regime’s days are numbered stickers spray paint and websites are the young activists’ weapons irony and street comedy mocking the regime have been hugely successful in puncturing public fear and enraging the powerful these slogans and symbols are the product of mass marketers employed by state departments and intelligence agencies for the sole purpose of destabilizing andor overthrowing a democratically elected or unfavorable to the oligarchygovernment the details and techniques of the manipulation of mass numbers of people have only continued to become more and more advanced and sophisticated particularly with the advent of social media as jonathan mowat wrote as in the case of the new communication technologies the potential effectiveness of angry youth in postmodern coups has long been under study as far back as  dr fred emery then director of the tavistock institute and an expert on the “hypnotic effects” of television specified that the then new phenomenon of “swarming adolescents” found at rock concerts could be effectively used to bring down the nationstate by the end of the s this was particularly the case as dr emery reported in “the next thirty years concepts methods and anticipations” in the group’s “human relations” because the phenomena was associated with “rebellious hysteria” the british military created the tavistock institute as its psychological warfare arm following world war i it has been the forerunner of such strategic planning ever since dr emery’s concept saw immediate application in nato’s use of “swarming adolescents” in toppling french president charles de gaulle in  … in november  case western reserve in cleveland ohio under the aegis of that university’s “program for social innovations in global management” began a series of conferences to review progress towards that strategic objective which was reported on in “human relations” in  there dr howard perlmutter a professor of “social architecture” at the wharton school and a follower of dr emery stressed that “rock video in kathmandu” was an appropriate image of how states with traditional cultures could be destabilized thereby creating the possibility of a “global civilization” there are two requirements for such a transformation he added “building internationally committed networks of international and locally committed organizations” and “creating global events” through “the transformation of a local event into one having virtually instantaneous international implications through massmedia” the american people must quickly learn the formula behind color revolutions destabilizations and the agendas of the world oligarchy before it becomes too late for us all they must learn that simply because “leaders” appear to them attempt to speak the same language and articulate rage does not mean that these leaders are men of the people protests are necessary directed rage may also be necessary but the wanton destruction of communities belonging to you or your neighbors is not only counterproductive it produces rage that will be aimed back at you and justifiably so the entire country is being played like a fiddle baltimore is not an isolated collection of dupes it is a microcosm it is time the american people wise up and become street smart before it is too late sources  tarpley webster g obama the postmodern

whether we have two days two years or twenty years before the rapture of the saints a simple review of national and world events should uncover satans latterday tactics of his runup to power and a simple review shows as always satan has been quite busy as the god of this world  cor  causing chaos and seeking to destroy christians and nonchristians alike  pet  thankfully believers have a power within them that is exponentially greater  john  we can boldly do what god has called us to do with the gifts he has given us knowing it is he who is in ultimate controlfor americans there are two things of which many christians seemingly are unaware agenda  and george soros both have had a huge effect on the direction of the united states for the last  to  years and to disregard them as just conspiracy theories could literally lead to our downfall as a world power—or even the loss of freedoms we take for grantedbut understanding what and who they are and the detrimental influence they have had on our country is absolutely necessary to knowunless you want to take an ostrich approach to our problems so below is a summary of agenda not meant to be fully indepth but hopefully enough to give you the big picture  agenda  while christian conservatives are focused on the fight to elect politicians who espouse biblical values most of us are unaware of the socialism being inserted into our local communities through agenda  never heard of agenda  if not thats what theyre counting onagenda  is a world agenda that is directly affecting your life liberty and pursuit of happinessyet few have even heard of the phrase agenda  in a nutshell is a united nations program promoting socialist goals that attack us constitutionally protected freedoms and liberties and if youre not worried about the stupid un think again liberals are pushing for the uns laws to be superior to our laws but thats a whole different subject i wont get into nowagenda  is the blueprint for the united nations to control the world yes they actually think they can and the bible says eventually there will be a world government so were watching bible prophecy being fulfilled agenda  is an abbreviation of the global agenda for the st century it got its start in  when the united nations held a huge conference in rio de janeiro called the united nations conference on environment and development  or the real earth summitfew conservatives much less christians paid much attention to this meeting but an astonishing  people attended from  countries the us congress never approved agenda  but president george h w bush senior clinton and obama have all signed executive orders implementing it in the usaccording to un literature agenda  is a comprehensive plan of action to be implemented globally nationally and locally by the un to cover every area in which humans affect the environmentwhich is of course everything the program is not secret but openly promoted within the uns public socialistic objectives however they stealthily have substituted the words sustainable development for environment in order to be more acceptable to americans so pay attention to the word sustainable in the future since the rio summit the un has mostly bypassed national governments using agenda s international council of local environmental initiatives iclei to make agreements directly with local governments icleis us presence has grown through the years to include agreements with over  cities towns and counties here implementing land use plans laid out in agenda  several cities have realized what iclei was up to and banned them from operating four states are discussing ways to stop iclei from operating—kansas new hampshire tennessee and arizona but most people are simply unaware of both their presence andor their agendaagenda s world goals include combating poverty changing consumption patterns and reducing private ownership homes cars farms etc so what does this meanpoverty—the us has too much money compared to the rest of the world therefore its wealth must be redistributed to the rest of the world under the banner of social justicechanging consumption patterns—the us is only  of the worlds population but consumes over  of the worlds energy that is considered extravagant and has to be correctedprivate home ownershipthese dingbats know americans have too much control of their lives due to the large amount of private ownership of houses cars farms savings etc and they want to solve that problem so we can be more easily controlled by the unmost of us would laugh off the above as being ridiculous but they are not only serious but have been stealthily implementing this since they also just despise the large percentage of gun owners in america surely youve noticed that they bash gun owners every chance they get more on this lateronce the broad goals are adopted locally then come the demands to allow overreaching regulations have you ever wondered where all these weird regulations in so many local governments are coming from agenda eventually they want control of the way americans live eat learn and communicate they want to be able to limit water electricity and transportation agenda  authors admit that it calls for specific changes in the activities of all people no one would be free from the watchful eye of the proposed global tracking and information system sound familiar rev  talks about getting to the point that every person on the planet will be controlled from one place this happens a few years after the rapture so as this moves along the closer we are to our twinkling of an eye exit  cor the ultimate goal of agenda  now cleverly referred to as growth management smart growth or comprehensive planning is to cram people into small livable areas in order to institute population control map shows areas in red to be cleared of humans as mandated by the un man and biosphere program naturally one wonders how the heck they think private property is up for grabs until you look at the un charter compared to the us constitutionwhen the us tries to claim that we must get the approval of the un to implement an action then were in effect saying that we are under the laws of the un not under the laws of the usand the laws of the un are not the same as the us the un laws leave just enough wiggle room to do pretty much whatever they want to achieve their goals where the us constitution demands compensation for property seizures the un does not  agenda  includes a plan for social justice that will redistribute wealth the us is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and naturally uses more energy so we will be the hardest hit by environmental regulation but rather than using environment a word people are getting weary of they are substituting the word sustainabilitythe goal of sustainability ie using government to accomplish vague earthcaring goals is contrary to us free market capitalism its not the smoke they hate its just a ruse to regulate private business third world countries that cannot financially afford to comply with the ridiculous environmental regulations will continue their high levels of fossil fuel consumption forcing the us to conserve even more to make up for those countriesobama signed executive order  establishing a white house rural council prescribed by agenda  the amount of government resources obama has directed to administer this order is almost unbelievable not surprisingly obama committed thousands of federal employees in  federal agencies to promote sustainability in rural areas completely bypassing congressional approvalnot all of these agencies are even related to rural areas their agenda is to entice local communities into adopting agenda  programs by providing them millions of dollars in grants rural areas  of the us are fast becoming directly controlled by the federal government—including education food supply land and water use recreation private property and energyagenda  will be difficult to defeat now that it is already ingrained into over  local governments across the us it is possible that if republicans take over the white house the president could ban agenda  but dont hold your breath so the only way to actually fight this thing is to fight it locally texans for accountable government is doing this by educating local boards and commissions and serving on them its going to take that kind of grass roots action see link belowbut dont miss the main objective of the un which is total control of everyone and everything even if it seems farfetched to you and me the fact is they believe it and the bible predicts it and for the worlds elitists satans minions the us is the last stumbling block to total control linkslink to a presentation by tag to an austin texas city council meetinghttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvhltrxkuahttpwwwvarightcomnewsgreatnewsoutofarizonariodeclarationandicleitooonlyahousevoteawayfrombeingbannedinarizona    george soros the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the united states   george soros   what george soros is doing makes agenda  look like a girl scout meeting just unbelievable soros is hungarian by birth has jewish roots and changed his name from schwartz to avoid the german persecution of jews in the s hes a multibillionaire nonpracticing jew who has fully embraced atheism he is a socialist leaning toward marxism and loathes the capitalistic united statesin  soros worked under adolf eichmann in hungary during wwll and has referred to that year as one of the best years of his life eichmann was overseeing the murder of  jews while at the same time confiscating their property so its a bit difficult to understand why mr soros calls it a great yearafter wwll soros attended the london school of economics where he was tutored by the infamous atheist karl popper learning how to implement and manage social engineeringin  soros moved to new york city where he worked on wall street amassing a fortune in the capitalistic world of hedge funds and currency speculationconsidered to be absolutely ruthless amoral and shrewd he had amassed his fortune by the mids in  he shorted the british pound leveraging billions in paper financial bets causing britons to see their homes devalued and life savings purchasing power cut by  almost overnightsoros was involved in and hugely financially benefited from the collapse of the former soviet empire as well as the financial problems in thailand and malaysia thai activist weng tojirakarn said we regard george soros as kind of a dracula he sucks the blood from the peoplethe russians are so mad at soros they issued an arrest warrant for him calling him an international financial terrorist they claim the russian secret service found that he was using foreign currency derivatives to start an attack on the russian currency shares in the marketwhen you throw in his roles in the financial problems in yugoslavia georgia hungary ukraine and myanmar formally burma you can better understand why and how his tightening tentacles of globalization and the new world order give him more and more powersoros once told a major australian newspaper america as the center of the globalized financial markets was sucking up the savings of the world this is now over the game is out he added the time has come for a very serious adjustment in americas consumption habits you may recall that our esteemed president obama committed some  billion dollars of aid to brazil to give them an investment advantage as they expanded their offshore oil fields this was done at the same time he was denying permits to us companies to drill in the waters off our own coasts but what you probably didnt know was that his aid to brazil came shortly after his largest political financial backer george soros had invested heavily in a brazilian oil company named petrobrastait trussel writes the petrobras deal may be a windfall for soros and brazil but its a bad deal for the usthe american petroleum institute estimates that had the obama administration allowed the same type of drilling in waters off the us coasts it would have created some  new highwage jobs in the us not to mention somewhere in the range of  trillion dollars in federal state and local revenuewhich of course would move us toward energy independence have you ever wondered why barack hussein obama will not allow the canadian pipeline and offshore drilling that would give us huge amounts of oil but rather wants us to pay through the nose to the arabssoros loathes america and has been actively working to destroy it for years backing candidates who support extreme liberal positions like open borders a oneworld foreign policy legalized drugs euthanasia and progressive positions supporting rights and entitlementshis support has been critical in electing many of the more radical democrats who replaced moderatesdavid horowitz and richard poe authored the book the shadow party its a detailed outline of how soros got control of the democratic party and now pretty much calls all the shotsit shows how the shadow party became the shadow government which became the obama administration in the shadow party the authors sayby soros own admission he helped engineer coups in slovakia croatia georgia and yugoslavia when soros targets a country for regime change he begins by creating a shadow government a fullformed governmentinexile ready to assume power when the opportunity arisesthe shadow party soros has built in america greatly resembles those he has created in other countries prior to instigating a coup says the discoverthenetworksorgin the november  edition of the german magazine der spiegel soros was quoted on what he thought the next us president should do immediately after taking office i think we need a large stimulus packagearound  billion dollarswhen obama and the democrats were swept into office soros said i think obama presents us a great opportunity to finally deal with global warming and energy dependence the us needs a capandtrade system with auctioning of licenses for emissions rights this of course is exactly what obama is seekingin  soros donated five billion dollars to the democratic national committee both to secure obamas election win and elect as many farleft liberals as possible yes you read that right five billion dollars to the democratsthese eyepopping donations actually beginning during the clinton administration have continued through today he controls dozens of companies through which he funnels money to promote his causested behr who is a christian and a movie critic spoke at one of our steeling the mind conferences and lamented that he has proof that grated family movies are hugely profitable but he cant get the major studios to invest in themsurprise surprise turns out that soros has huge influence in the entertainment industry he owns  million shares of time warner and therefore can insist they avoid scripts with conservative christian values have you ever wondered why almost every major movie has at least one prohomosexual scenehis influence in the mainstream media is also quite heavy msnbc calls those who identify with the tea party dangerous radicals while praising those in the occupy movement richard poe writes soros private philanthropy totaling nearly  billion dollars continues undermining americas traditional western values his giving has provided funding of abortion rights atheism drug legalization sex education euthanasia feminism gun control globalization mass immigration gay marriage and other radical experiments in social engineeringsoros heavily supports moveonorg media matters for america the tides foundation the aclu acorn planned parenthood the occupy movement and many more you can get a complete list and descriptions at discoverthenetworksorgin summary george soros is an antiamerican antichristian farleft liberal billionaire and is on a noholdsbarred fight to take america down in order for his vision of a new world order to be instituted as hard as it is to believe that  one guy can have this much impact its true but the answer for believers is not only voting for candidates who stand on biblical values we also must pray for our nation to wake up to what is going on otherwise the land of the free may come to a screeching halt much sooner than any of us dreamedbottom line—armor up with gods word god allowed us to live at the time we do be ready to defend what you believe below are great dvds with a wealth of

also known as elizabeth came from a family that owned a thriving silk shop his father tivadar also known as teodoro was a lawyer and had been a prisoner of war during and after world war i until he escaped from russia and rejoined his family in budapest the two married in  tivadar was an esperantist writer and taught soros to speak esperanto in his childhood in  soross family changed their name from the germanjewish schwartz to soros as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic hungary tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning in hungarian soros means next in line or designated successor in esperanto it means will soar soros was  years old in march  when nazi germany occupied hungary jewish children were barred from attending school by the nazis and soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the judenrat jewish council which had been established during the occupation soros later described this time to writer michael lewis the jewish council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices i was told to go to the jewish council and there i was given these small slips of paper i took this piece of paper to my father he instantly recognized it this was a list of hungarian jewish lawyers he said you deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported soros did not return to that job his family purchased documents to say that they were christians thereby allowing them to survive the war later that year at age  soros posed as the christian godson of an official of the collaborationist hungarian governments ministry of agriculture who himself had a jewish wife in hiding on one occasion rather than leave the  year old alone the official took soros with him while he inventoried a rich jewish familys estate though soros did not take part tivadar not only saved his immediate family but also many other hungarian jews and george would later write that  had been the

received £ from a quaker charity in a discussion at the los angeles world affairs council in  alvin shuster former foreign editor of the los angeles times asked soros how does one go from an immigrant to a financier  when did you realize that you knew how to make money soros replied well i had a variety of jobs and i ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside souvenir shops and i thought thats really not what i was cut out to do so i wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in london got just one or two replies and eventually thats how i got a job in a merchant bank that job was an entrylevel position in singer  friedlander soros earned a bachelor of science in philosophy in  and a master of science in philosophy in  both from the london school of economics investment career early business experience after graduating soros found it difficult to get work and settled for a job as a traveling salesman for a fancygoods wholesaler selling to retailers in welsh seaside resorts he described this period as the low point of my life and wrote letters to a number of merchant banks requesting interviews many of these ignored him and others humiliated him in the interviews he credits his acceptance at singer and friedlander to the fact that the managing director was a fellow hungarian singer and friedlander in  soros began his financial career at the merchant bank singer  friedlander of london he worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department a fellow employee robert mayer suggested he apply at his fathers brokerage house fm mayer of new york fm mayer in  soros moved to new york city where he worked as an arbitrage trader for fm mayer – he specialized in european stocks which were becoming popular with us institutional investors following the formation of the coal and steel community which later became the common market wertheim and co in  after three years at fm mayer he moved to wertheim  co as an analyst of european securities where he stayed until  he planned to stay for five years enough time to save  after which he intended to return to england to study philosophy during this period soros developed the theory of reflexivity based on the ideas of karl popper reflexivity posited that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation reflexive feedback loops are created where ideas influence events and events influence ideas soros further argued that this leads to markets having procyclical virtuous or vicious cycles of boom and bust in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics arnhold and s bleichroeder from  to  soross experience as a vice president at arnhold and s bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job business was slack following the introduction of the interest equalization tax which undermined the viability of soross european trading he spent the years from  to  with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation in  he started a fund with  of the firms money to experiment with his trading strategies but he was principally motivated by a desire to assert himself as an investor to profit from his reflexivity insights in  soros set up the double eagle hedge fund with m of investors capital including  of his own money it was based in curaçao dutch antilles in  the double eagle fund had  million and formed the basis of the soros fund george soros and jim rogers received returns on their share of capital and  percent of the profits each year soros fund management in  soros founded soros fund management and became its chairman among those who held senior positions there at various times were jim rogers stanley druckenmiller mark schwartz keith anderson and soross two sons in  due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds soros resigned from the management of the double eagle fund he then established the soros fund and gave investors in the double eagle fund the option of transferring to that or staying with arnhold and s bleichroeder it was later renamed as the quantum fund named after the physical theory of quantum mechanics by that time the value of the fund had grown to m only a small proportion of which was soross own money he and jim rogers reinvested their returns from the fund and also a large part of their  performance fees thereby expanding their stake by  the fund had grown to m and then a  loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to m in july  soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors money valued at  billion and instead invested funds from his  billion family fortune due to changes in us securities and exchange commission disclosure rules which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors the fund had at that time averaged over  per year compound returns in  the quantum fund made  billion making it again the most successful hedge fund in history since its inception in  the fund has generated  billion the fund announced that it would inject  million to help finance the expansion of fen hotels an argentine hotel company the funds will develop  rooms over the next three years throughout various latin american countries  pound short soros had been building a huge position in pounds sterling for months leading up to september  soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the united kingdom in the european exchange rate mechanism for soros the rate at which the united kingdom was brought into the european exchange rate mechanism was too high their inflation was also much too high triple the german rate and british interest rates were hurting their asset prices on september   black wednesday soross fund sold short more than  billion in pounds profiting from the uk governments reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other european exchange rate mechanism countries or float its currency finally the uk withdrew from the european exchange rate mechanism devaluing the pound soross profit on the bet was estimated at over  billion he was dubbed the man who broke the bank of england the estimated cost of black wednesday to the uk treasury was £ billion on october   the times quoted soros as saying our total position by black wednesday had to be worth almost  billion we planned to sell more than that in fact when norman lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly  billion to defend sterling we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell stanley druckenmiller who traded under soros originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated soross contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position in  during the asian financial crisis the prime minister of malaysia mahathir bin mohamad accused soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the association of southeast asian nations asean for welcoming myanmar as a member following on a history of antisemitic remarks mahathir made specific reference to soross jewish background it is a jew who triggered the currency plunge and implied soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger jewish conspiracy nine years later in  mahathir met with soros and afterward stated that he accepted that soros had not been responsible for the crisis in s the crisis of global capitalism open society endangered soros explained his role in the crisis as follows the financial crisis that originated in thailand in  was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity by the beginning of  it was clear to soros fund management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable we sold short the thai baht and the malaysian ringgit early in  with maturities ranging from six months to a year that is we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates thai baht and malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold subsequently prime minister mahathir of malaysia accused me of causing the crisis a wholly unfounded accusation we were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis on the contrary we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation much too soon as it turned out we left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that mahathir would impose capital controls he did so but much later in  economist paul krugman was critical of soross effect on financial markets nobody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit these new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name my proposed term is soroi in an interview regarding the lates recession soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the s according to soros market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been some kind of an ideological excess in soross view the markets moods—a mood of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimismpessimism with which the markets look at reality—actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially selfreinforcing but eventually unsustainable and selfdefeating boombust sequences or bubbles in reaction to the lates recession he founded the institute for new economic thinking in october  this is a think tank composed of international economic business and financial experts mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system société générale insider trade in  soros was contacted by a french financier named

privatization program something instituted by the new government under jacques chirac soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four french companies société générale as well as suez paribas and the compagnie générale délectricité in  the commission des opérations de bourse cob—the french stock exchange regulatory authority conducted an investigation of whether soross transaction in société générale should be considered insider trading soros had received no information from the société générale and had no insider knowledge of the business but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt initial investigations found soros innocent and no charges were brought forward however the case was reopened a few years later and the french supreme court confirmed the conviction on june   but reduced the penalty to € soros denied any wrongdoing saying news of the takeover was public knowledge and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover in december  he appealed to the european court of human rights on various grounds including that the year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing on the basis of article  of the european convention on human rights stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed the court agreed to hear the appeal in october  the court rejected his appeal in a – decision saying that soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws personal life soros has been married three times and divorced twice in  he married annaliese witschak annaliese

views external video george soros the lecture series introduction  general theory of reflexivity  financial markets  open society  capitalism vs open society  all by the open society foundations reflexivity financial markets and economic theory soross writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a near to equilibrium or a far from equilibrium state he argues that when markets are rising or falling rapidly they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium and that the conventional economic theory of the market the efficient market hypothesis does not apply in these situations soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium static disequilibrium and nearequilibrium conditions he has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect reflexivity is based on three main ideas reflexivity is best observed under special conditions where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena examples of factors that may give rise to this bias include a equity leveraging or b the trendfollowing habits of speculators reflexivity appears intermittently since it is most likely to be revealed under certain conditions ie the character of the equilibrium process is best considered in terms of probabilities investors observation of and participation in the capital markets may at times influence valuations and fundamental conditions or outcomes a recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets lenders began to make more money available to more people in the s to buy houses more people bought houses with this larger amount of money thus increasing the prices of these houses lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans but that their equity backing the loans – the value of the houses had gone up because more money was chasing the same amount of housing relatively thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good and prices rose higher still this was further amplified by public policy in the us home loans were guaranteed by the federal government many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for firsttime home buyers and other financial subsidies such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation these further encouraged house purchases leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards the concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot soros theories were originally dismissed by economists but have received more attention after the  crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the journal of economic methodology the notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of complexity economics as developed at the santa fe institute although soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the s reflexivity in politics although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets he has also explored its effects in politics he has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the open society in the past were from communism and fascism as discussed in the open society and its enemies by his mentor karl popper the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism he has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the united states is a reflexive phenomenon insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable view of problems in the free market system soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries he blames many of the worlds problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism soros claims to draw a distinction between being a participant in the market and working to change the rules that market participants must follow market predictions soross book the new paradigm for financial markets may  described a superbubble that had built up over the past  years and was ready to collapse this was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster as he states i have a record of crying wolf i did it first in the alchemy of finance in  then in the crisis of global capitalism in  and now in this book so its three books predicting disaster after the boy cried wolf three times  the wolf really came he ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong im only rich because i know when im wrong i basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes i very often used to get backaches due to the fact that i was wrong whenever you are wrong you have to fight or take flight when i make the decision the backache goes away in february  soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated adding that there was no prospect of a nearterm resolution to the crisis we witnessed the collapse of the financial system it was placed on life support and its still on life support theres no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom in january  at an economic forum in sri lanka soros predicted a financial crisis akin to  based on the state of global currency stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking chinese yuan china has a major adjustment problem i would say it amounts to a crisis when i look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in  views on antisemitism and israel when asked about what he thought about israel in the new yorker soros replied that i dont deny the jews to a right to a national existence – but i dont want anything to do with it according to hacked emails released in  soros open society foundation has a selfdescribed objective of “challenging israel’s racist and antidemocratic policies” in international forums in part by questioning israel’s reputation as a democracy he has funded ngos which have been actively critical of israeli policies including groups that campaign for the boycott divestment and sanctions movement against israel soros has been accused of saying that both jews and israel are partially responsible for antisemitism in response to his statement that the administrations of gw bush in the us and ariel sharon in israel were stoking antisemitism he has also said that jews cant overcome antisemitism without giving up on the tribalness on november   at a jewish forum in new york city soros partially attributed a recent resurgence of antisemitism to the policies of israel and the united states and the role of wealthy and influential individuals there is a resurgence of antisemitism in europe the policies of the bush administration and the sharon administration contribute to that its not specifically antisemitism but it does manifest itself in antisemitism as well im critical of those policies if we change that direction then antisemitism also will diminish i cant see how one could confront it directly im also very concerned about my own role because the new antisemitism holds that the jews rule the world as an unintended consequence of my actions i also contribute to that image in a subsequent article for the new york review of books soros emphasized that i do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of israel and i am not blaming jews for antisemitism antisemitism predates the birth of israel neither israels policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for antisemitism at the same time i do believe that attitudes toward israel are influenced by israels policies and attitudes toward the jewish community are influenced by the proisrael lobbys success in suppressing divergent views during a  billion lawsuit against soros by beny steinmetzs israeli company bsg resources which alleged soros used his sway with the government of guinea to freeze the israeli company out of iron ore mining contracts  the lawsuit alleges that soros hostility to israel is a motive for his actions to soros steinmetz’s success as well as his active passionate promotion of israeli life business and culture are anathema” bsgr said in the lawsuit “soros is also well known for his longstanding animus toward the state of israel during an award ceremony for imre kertész soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming “perpetrators of violence” suggesting that this model explained israels behaviour towards the palestinians which led to walkouts and soros being booed in july  israels ministry of foreign affairs released a statement denouncing soros a move that appeared designed to align israel more closely with hungary ahead of a visit to budapest by prime minister benjamin netanyahu israels foreign ministry stated the soros continuously undermines israels democratically elected governments adding that soros funded organizations that defame the jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself views on the us on november   in an interview with the washington post soros said that removing president george w bush from office was the central focus of my life and a matter of life and death he said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat bush if someone guaranteed it soros gave  million to the center for american progress  million to moveonorg and  million to america coming together these groups worked to support democrats in the  election on september   he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech why we must not reelect president bush delivered at the national press club in washington dc the online transcript to this speech received many hits after dick cheney accidentally referred to factcheckorg as factcheckcom in the vice presidential debate causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to soross site his  book the bubble of american supremacy was a forthright critique of the bush administrations war on terror as misconceived and counterproductive and a polemic against the reelection of bush he explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the selfreinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices when soros was asked in  about his statement in the age of fallibility that the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the united states he responded that it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world and i think thats rather shocking for americans to hear the united states sets the agenda for the world and the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda by declaring a war on terror after september  we set the wrong agenda for the world when you wage war you inevitably create innocent victims soros described donald trump as a con man soros expects trump to fail because soros believes trumps ideas are selfcontradictory soros believes trump is preparing for a trade war and expects financial markets to do badly views on europe in october  soros drafted an open letter entitled as concerned europeans we urge eurozone leaders to unite in which he calls for a stronger economic government for europe using federal means common eu treasury common fiscal supervision etc and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the economic crisis the letter was cosigned by javier solana daniel cohnbendit andrew duff emma bonino massimo dalema vaira vikefreiberga soros criticized hungarian prime minister viktor orbán and his handling of the european migrant crisis in  his plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle soros expects that brexit will fail and the premiership of theresa may will last only a short time views on asia soros has expressed concern about the growth of chinese economic and political power saying china has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests they have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well regarding the political gridlock in america he said today china has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the united states in july  soros stated that a strategic partnership between the us and china could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict in january  during an interview at the world economic forum wef in davos soros stated that a hard landing is practically unavoidable chinese state media responded by stating soros’ challenge to the rmb and hong kong dollar are doomed to fail without any doubt views on russia and ukraine in may  soros told cnns fareed zakaria i set up a foundation in ukraine before ukraine became independent from russia and the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now in january  soros said that europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from russia he also urged western countries to expand economic sanctions against russia for its support of separatists in eastern ukraine in january  soros called on the european union to give  billion of bailout money to ukraine in july  soros stated that putins annexation of crimea was a challenge to the prevailing world order specifically the european union he hypothesized that putin wants to destabilize all of ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern ukraine which would then depend on russia for economic support in november  russia banned the open society foundations osf and the open society institute osi two prodemocracy charities founded by soros—stating they posed as threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the russian federation and the security of the state in january   books related to soros renewal of humanitarian education program were burned at vorkuta mining and economic college in the

time were uncomfortable with their roots soros has described his home as antisemitic his mother erzsébet also known as elizabeth came from a family that owned a thriving silk shop his father tivadar also known as teodoro was a lawyer and had been a prisoner of war during and after world war i until he escaped from russia and rejoined his family in budapest the two married in  tivadar was an esperantist writer and taught soros to speak esperanto in his childhood in  soross family changed their name from the germanjewish schwartz to soros as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic hungary tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning in hungarian soros means next in line or designated successor in esperanto it means will soar soros was  years old in march  when nazi germany occupied hungary jewish children were barred from attending school by the nazis and soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the judenrat jewish council which had been established during the occupation soros later described this time to writer michael lewis the jewish council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices i was told to go to the jewish council and there i was given these small slips of paper i took this piece of paper to my father he instantly recognized it this was a list of hungarian jewish lawyers he said you deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported soros did not return to that job his family purchased documents to say that they were christians thereby allowing them to survive the war later that year at age  soros posed as the christian godson of an official of the collaborationist hungarian governments ministry of agriculture who himself had a jewish wife in hiding on one occasion rather than leave the  year old alone the official took soros with him while he inventoried a rich jewish familys estate though soros did not take part tivadar not only saved his immediate family but also many other hungarian jews and george would later write that  had been the happiest year of his life for it had given him the opportunity to witness his fathers heroism in  soros survived the siege of budapest in which soviet and german forces fought house to house through the city in  soros immigrated to england and became a student at the london

affairs council in  alvin shuster former foreign editor of the los angeles times asked soros how does one go from an immigrant to a financier  when did you realize that you knew how to make money soros replied well i had a variety of jobs and i ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside souvenir shops and i thought thats really not what i was cut out to do so i wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in london got just one or two replies and eventually thats how i got a job in a merchant bank that job was an entrylevel position in singer  friedlander soros earned a bachelor of science in philosophy in  and a master of science in philosophy in  both from the london school of economics investment career early business experience after graduating soros found it difficult to get work and settled for a job as a traveling salesman for a fancygoods wholesaler selling to retailers in welsh seaside resorts he described this period as the low point of my life and wrote letters to a number of merchant banks requesting interviews many of these ignored him and others humiliated him in the interviews he credits his acceptance at singer and friedlander to the fact that the managing director was a fellow hungarian singer and friedlander in  soros began his financial career at the merchant bank singer  friedlander of london he worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department a fellow employee robert mayer suggested he apply at his fathers brokerage house fm mayer of new york fm mayer in  soros moved to new york city where he worked as an arbitrage trader for fm mayer – he specialized in european stocks which were becoming popular with us institutional investors following the formation of the coal and steel community which later became the common market wertheim and co in  after three years at fm mayer he moved to wertheim  co as an analyst of european securities where he stayed until  he planned to stay for five years enough time to save  after which he intended to return to england to study philosophy during this period soros developed the theory of reflexivity based on the ideas of karl popper reflexivity posited that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation reflexive feedback loops are created where ideas influence events and events influence ideas soros further argued that this leads to markets having procyclical virtuous or vicious cycles of boom and bust in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics arnhold and s bleichroeder from  to  soross experience as a vice president at arnhold and s bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job business was slack following the introduction of the interest equalization tax which undermined the viability of soross european trading he spent the years from  to  with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation in  he started a fund with  of the firms money to experiment with his trading strategies but he was principally motivated by a desire to assert himself as an investor to profit from his reflexivity insights in  soros set up the double eagle hedge fund with m of investors capital including  of his own money it was based in curaçao dutch antilles in  the double eagle fund had  million and formed the basis of the soros fund george soros and jim rogers received returns on their share of capital and  percent of the profits each year soros fund management in  soros founded soros fund management and became its chairman among those who held senior positions there at various times were jim rogers stanley druckenmiller mark schwartz keith anderson and soross two sons in  due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds soros resigned from the management of the double eagle fund he then established the soros fund and gave investors in the double eagle fund the option of transferring to that or staying with arnhold and s bleichroeder it was later renamed as the quantum fund named after the physical theory of quantum mechanics by that time the value of the fund had grown to m only a small proportion of which was soross own money he and jim rogers reinvested their returns from the fund and also a large part of their  performance fees thereby expanding their stake by  the fund had grown to m and then a  loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to m in july  soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors money valued at  billion and instead invested funds from his  billion family fortune due to changes in us securities and exchange commission disclosure rules which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors the fund had at that time averaged over  per year compound returns in  the quantum fund made  billion making it again the most successful hedge fund in history since its inception in  the fund has generated  billion the fund announced that it would inject  million to help finance the expansion of fen hotels an argentine hotel company the funds will develop  rooms over the next three years throughout various latin american countries  pound short soros had been building a huge position in pounds sterling for months leading up to september  soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the united kingdom in the european exchange rate mechanism for soros the rate at which the united kingdom was brought into the european exchange rate mechanism was too high their inflation was also much too high triple the german rate and british interest rates were hurting their asset prices on september   black wednesday soross fund sold short more than  billion in pounds profiting from the uk governments reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other european exchange rate mechanism countries or float its currency finally the uk withdrew from the european exchange rate mechanism devaluing the pound soross profit on the bet was estimated at over  billion he was dubbed the man who broke the bank of england the estimated cost of black wednesday to the uk treasury was £ billion on october   the times quoted soros as saying our total position by black wednesday had to be worth almost  billion we planned to sell more than that in fact when norman lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly  billion to defend sterling we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell stanley druckenmiller who traded under soros originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated soross contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position in  during the asian financial crisis the prime minister of malaysia mahathir bin mohamad accused soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the association of southeast asian nations asean for welcoming myanmar as a member following on a history of antisemitic remarks mahathir made specific reference to soross jewish background it is a jew who triggered the currency plunge and implied soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger jewish conspiracy nine years later in  mahathir met with soros and afterward stated that he accepted that soros had not been responsible for the crisis in s the crisis of global capitalism open society endangered soros explained his role in the crisis as follows the financial crisis that originated in thailand in  was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity by the beginning of  it was clear to soros fund management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable we sold short the thai baht and the malaysian ringgit early in  with maturities ranging from six months to a year that is we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates thai baht and malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold subsequently prime minister mahathir of malaysia accused me of causing the crisis a wholly unfounded accusation we were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis on the contrary we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation much too soon as it turned out we left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that mahathir would impose capital controls he did so but much later in  economist paul krugman was critical of soross effect on financial markets nobody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit these new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name my proposed term is soroi in an interview regarding the lates recession soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the s according to soros market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been some kind of an ideological excess in soross view the markets moods—a mood of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimismpessimism with which the markets look at reality—actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially selfreinforcing but eventually unsustainable and selfdefeating boombust sequences or bubbles in reaction to the lates recession he founded the institute for new economic thinking in october  this is a think tank composed of international economic business and financial experts mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system société générale insider trade in  soros was contacted by a french financier named georges pébereau who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in société générale a leading french bank that was part of a privatization program something instituted by the new government under jacques chirac soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four french companies société générale as well as suez paribas and the compagnie générale délectricité in  the commission des opérations de bourse cob—the french stock exchange regulatory authority conducted an investigation of whether soross transaction in société générale should be considered insider trading soros had received no information from the société générale and had no insider knowledge of the business but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt initial investigations found soros innocent and no charges were brought forward however the case was reopened a few years later and the french supreme court confirmed the conviction on june   but reduced the penalty to € soros denied any wrongdoing saying news of the takeover was public knowledge and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover in december  he appealed to the european court of human rights on various grounds including that the year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing on the basis of article  of the european convention on human rights stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed the court agreed to hear the appeal in october  the court rejected his appeal in a – decision saying that soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws personal life soros has been married three times and divorced twice in  he married annaliese witschak annaliese was an ethnic german immigrant who had been

the same speech he also endorsed the oregon death with dignity act proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign political and economic views external video george soros the lecture series introduction  general theory of reflexivity  financial markets  open society  capitalism vs open society  all by the open society foundations reflexivity financial markets and economic theory soross writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a near to equilibrium or a far from equilibrium state he argues that when markets are rising or falling rapidly they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium and that the conventional economic theory of the market the efficient market hypothesis does not apply in these situations soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium static disequilibrium and nearequilibrium conditions he has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect reflexivity is based on three main ideas reflexivity is best observed under special conditions where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena examples of factors that may give rise to this bias include a equity leveraging or b the trendfollowing habits of speculators reflexivity appears intermittently since it is most likely to be revealed under certain conditions ie the character of the equilibrium process is best considered in terms of probabilities investors observation of and participation in the capital markets may at times influence valuations and fundamental conditions or outcomes a recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets lenders began to make more money available to more people in the s to buy houses more people bought houses with this larger amount of money thus increasing the prices of these houses lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans but that their equity backing the loans – the value of the houses had gone up because more money was chasing the same amount of housing relatively thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good and prices rose higher still this was further amplified by public policy in the us home loans were guaranteed by the federal government many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for firsttime home buyers and other financial subsidies such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation these further encouraged house purchases leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards the concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot soros theories were originally dismissed by economists but have received more attention after the  crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the journal of economic methodology the notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of complexity economics as developed at the santa fe institute although soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the s reflexivity in politics although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets he has also explored its effects in politics he has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the open society in the past were from communism and fascism as discussed in the open society and its enemies by his mentor karl popper the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism he has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the united states is a reflexive phenomenon insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable view of problems in the free market system soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries he blames many of the worlds problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism soros claims to draw a distinction between being a participant in the market and working to change the rules that market participants must follow market predictions soross book the new paradigm for financial markets may  described a superbubble that had built up over the past  years and was ready to collapse this was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster as he states i have a record of crying wolf i did it first in the alchemy of finance in  then in the crisis of global capitalism in  and now in this book so its three books predicting disaster after the boy cried wolf three times  the wolf really came he ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong im only rich because i know when im wrong i basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes i very often used to get backaches due to the fact that i was wrong whenever you are wrong you have to fight or take flight when i make the decision the backache goes away in february  soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated adding that there was no prospect of a nearterm resolution to the crisis we witnessed the collapse of the financial system it was placed on life support and its still on life support theres no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom in january  at an economic forum in sri lanka soros predicted a financial crisis akin to  based on the state of global currency stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking chinese yuan china has a major adjustment problem i would say it amounts to a crisis when i look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in  views on antisemitism and israel when asked about what he thought about israel in the new yorker soros replied that i dont deny the jews to a right to a national existence – but i dont want anything to do with it according to hacked emails released in  soros open society foundation has a selfdescribed objective of “challenging israel’s racist and antidemocratic policies” in international forums in part by questioning israel’s reputation as a democracy he has funded ngos which have been actively critical of israeli policies including groups that campaign for the boycott divestment and sanctions movement against israel soros has been accused of saying that both jews and israel are partially responsible for antisemitism in response to his statement that the administrations of gw bush in the us and ariel sharon in israel were stoking antisemitism he has also said that jews cant overcome antisemitism without giving up on the tribalness on november   at a jewish forum in new york city soros partially attributed a recent resurgence of antisemitism to the policies of israel and the united states and the role of wealthy and influential individuals there is a resurgence of antisemitism in europe the policies of the bush administration and the sharon administration contribute to that its not specifically antisemitism but it does manifest itself in antisemitism as well im critical of those policies if we change that direction then antisemitism also will diminish i cant see how one could confront it directly im also very concerned about my own role because the new antisemitism holds that the jews rule the world as an unintended consequence of my actions i also contribute to that image in a subsequent article for the new york review of books soros emphasized that i do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of israel and i am not blaming jews for antisemitism antisemitism predates the birth of israel neither israels policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for antisemitism at the same time i do believe that attitudes toward israel are influenced by israels policies and attitudes toward the jewish community are influenced by the proisrael lobbys success in suppressing divergent views during a  billion lawsuit against soros by beny steinmetzs israeli company bsg resources which alleged soros used his sway with the government of guinea to freeze the israeli company out of iron ore mining contracts  the lawsuit alleges that soros hostility to israel is a motive for his actions to soros steinmetz’s success as well as his active passionate promotion of israeli life business and culture are anathema” bsgr said in the lawsuit “soros is also well known for his longstanding animus toward the state of israel during an award ceremony for imre kertész soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming “perpetrators of violence” suggesting that this model explained israels behaviour towards the palestinians which led to walkouts and soros being booed in july  israels ministry of foreign affairs released a statement denouncing soros a move that appeared designed to align israel more closely with hungary ahead of a visit to budapest by prime minister benjamin netanyahu israels foreign ministry stated the soros continuously undermines israels democratically elected governments adding that soros funded organizations that defame the jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself views on the us on november   in an interview with the washington post soros said that removing president george w bush from office was the central focus of my life and a matter of life and death he said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat bush if someone guaranteed it soros gave  million to the center for american progress  million to moveonorg and  million to america coming together these groups worked to support democrats in the  election on september   he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech why we must not reelect president bush delivered at the national press club in washington dc the online transcript to this speech received many hits after dick cheney accidentally referred to factcheckorg as factcheckcom in the vice presidential debate causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to soross site his  book the bubble of american supremacy was a forthright critique of the bush administrations war on terror as misconceived and counterproductive and a polemic against the reelection of bush he explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the selfreinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices when soros was asked in  about his statement in the age of fallibility that the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the united states he responded that it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world and i think thats rather shocking for americans to hear the united states sets the agenda for the world and the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda by declaring a war on terror after september  we set the wrong agenda for the world when you wage war you inevitably create innocent victims soros described donald trump as a con man soros expects trump to fail because soros believes trumps ideas are selfcontradictory soros believes trump is preparing for a trade war and expects financial markets to do badly views on europe in october  soros drafted an open letter entitled as concerned europeans we urge eurozone leaders to unite in which he calls for a stronger economic government for europe using federal means common eu treasury common fiscal supervision etc and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the economic crisis the letter was cosigned by javier solana daniel cohnbendit andrew duff emma bonino massimo dalema vaira vikefreiberga soros criticized hungarian prime minister viktor orbán and his handling of the european migrant crisis in  his plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle soros expects that brexit will fail and the premiership of theresa may will last only a short time views on asia soros has expressed concern about the growth of chinese economic and political power saying china has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests they have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well regarding the political gridlock in america he said today china has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the united states in july  soros stated that a strategic partnership between the us and china could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict in january  during an interview at the world economic forum wef in davos soros stated that a hard landing is practically unavoidable chinese state media responded by stating soros’ challenge to the rmb and hong kong dollar are doomed to fail without any doubt views on russia and ukraine in may  soros told cnns fareed zakaria i set up a foundation in ukraine before ukraine became independent from russia and the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now in january  soros said that europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from russia he also urged western countries to expand economic sanctions against russia for its support of separatists in eastern ukraine in january  soros called on the european union to give  billion of bailout money to ukraine in july  soros stated that putins annexation of crimea was a challenge to the prevailing world order specifically the european union he hypothesized that putin wants to destabilize all of ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern ukraine which would then depend on russia for economic support in november  russia banned the open society foundations osf and the open society institute osi two prodemocracy charities founded by soros—stating they posed as threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the russian federation and the security of the state in january   books related to soros renewal of humanitarian education program were burned at vorkuta mining and economic college in the komi republic with

many uppermiddle class hungarian jews at the time were uncomfortable with their roots soros has described his home as antisemitic his mother erzsébet also known as elizabeth came from a family that owned a thriving silk shop his father tivadar also known as teodoro was a lawyer and had been a prisoner of war during and after world war i until he escaped from russia and rejoined his family in budapest the two married in  tivadar was an esperantist writer and taught soros to speak esperanto in his childhood in  soross family changed their name from the germanjewish schwartz to soros as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic hungary tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning in hungarian soros means next in line or designated successor in esperanto it means will soar soros was  years old in march  when nazi germany occupied hungary jewish children were barred from attending school by the nazis and soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the judenrat jewish council which had been established during the occupation soros later described this time to writer michael lewis the jewish council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices i was told to go to the jewish council and there i was given these small slips of paper i took this piece of paper to my father he instantly recognized it this was a list of hungarian jewish lawyers he said you deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported soros did not return to that job his family purchased documents to say that they were christians thereby allowing them to survive the war later that year at age  soros posed as the christian godson of an official of the collaborationist hungarian governments ministry of agriculture who himself had a jewish wife in hiding on one occasion rather than leave the  year old alone the official took soros with him while he inventoried a rich jewish familys estate though soros did not take part tivadar not only saved his immediate family but also many other hungarian jews and george would later write that  had been the happiest year of his life for it had given him the opportunity to witness his fathers heroism in  soros survived the siege of budapest in which soviet and german forces fought house to house through the city in  soros immigrated to england and became a student at the london school of economics while a student of the philosopher karl popper soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter soros received £ from a quaker charity in a discussion at the los angeles world affairs council in  alvin shuster former foreign editor of the los angeles times asked soros how does one go from an immigrant to a financier  when did you realize that you knew how to make money soros replied well i had a variety of jobs and i ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside souvenir shops and i thought thats really not what i was cut out to do so i wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in london got just one or two replies and eventually thats how i got a job in a merchant bank that job was an entrylevel position in singer  friedlander soros earned a bachelor of science in philosophy in  and a master of science in philosophy in  both from the london school of economics investment career early business experience after graduating soros found it difficult to get work and settled for a job as a traveling salesman for a fancygoods wholesaler selling to retailers in welsh seaside resorts he described this period as the low point of my life and wrote letters to a number of merchant banks requesting interviews many of these ignored him and others humiliated him in the interviews he credits his acceptance at singer and friedlander to the fact that the managing director was a fellow hungarian singer and friedlander in  soros began his financial career at the merchant bank singer  friedlander of london he worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department a fellow employee robert mayer suggested he apply at his fathers brokerage house fm mayer of new york fm mayer in  soros moved to new york city where he worked as an arbitrage trader for fm mayer – he specialized in european stocks which were becoming popular with us institutional investors following the formation of the coal and steel community which later became the common market wertheim and co in  after three years at fm mayer he moved to wertheim  co as an analyst of european securities where he stayed until  he planned to stay for five years enough time to save  after which he intended to return to england to study philosophy during this period soros developed the theory of reflexivity based on the ideas of karl popper reflexivity posited that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation reflexive feedback loops are created where ideas influence events and events influence ideas soros further argued that this leads to markets having procyclical virtuous or vicious cycles of boom and bust in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics arnhold and s bleichroeder from  to  soross experience as a vice president at arnhold and s bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job business was slack following the introduction of the interest equalization tax which undermined the viability of soross european trading he spent the years from  to  with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation in  he started a fund with  of the firms money to experiment with his trading strategies but he was principally motivated by a desire to assert himself as an investor to profit from his reflexivity insights in  soros set up the double eagle hedge fund with m of investors capital including  of his own money it was based in curaçao dutch antilles in  the double eagle fund had  million and formed the basis of the soros fund george soros and jim rogers received returns on their share of capital and  percent of the profits each year soros fund management in  soros founded soros fund management and became its chairman among those who held senior positions there at various times were jim rogers stanley druckenmiller mark schwartz keith anderson and soross two sons in  due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds soros resigned from the management of the double eagle fund he then established the soros fund and gave investors in the double eagle fund the option of transferring to that or staying with arnhold and s bleichroeder it was later renamed as the quantum fund named after the physical theory of quantum mechanics by that time the value of the fund had grown to m only a small proportion of which was soross own money he and jim rogers reinvested their returns from the fund and also a large part of their  performance fees thereby expanding their stake by  the fund had grown to m and then a  loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to m in july  soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors money valued at  billion and instead invested funds from his  billion family fortune due to changes in us securities and exchange commission disclosure rules which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors the fund had at that time averaged over  per year compound returns in  the quantum fund made  billion making it again the most successful hedge fund in history since its inception in  the fund has generated  billion the fund announced that it would inject  million to help finance the expansion of fen hotels an argentine hotel company the funds will develop  rooms over the next three years throughout various latin american countries  pound short soros had been building a huge position in pounds sterling for months leading up to september  soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the united kingdom in the european exchange rate mechanism for soros the rate at which the united kingdom was brought into the european exchange rate mechanism was too high their inflation was also much too high triple the german rate and british interest rates were hurting their asset prices on september   black wednesday soross fund sold short more than  billion in pounds profiting from the uk governments reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other european exchange rate mechanism countries or float its currency finally the uk withdrew from the european exchange rate mechanism devaluing the pound soross profit on the bet was estimated at over  billion he was dubbed the man who broke the bank of england the estimated cost of black wednesday to the uk treasury was £ billion on october   the times quoted soros as saying our total position by black wednesday had to be worth almost  billion we planned to sell more than that in fact when norman lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly  billion to defend sterling we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell stanley druckenmiller who traded under soros originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated soross contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position in  during the asian financial crisis the prime minister of malaysia mahathir bin mohamad accused soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the association of southeast asian nations asean for welcoming myanmar as a member following on a history of antisemitic remarks mahathir made specific reference to soross jewish background it is a jew who triggered the currency plunge and implied soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger jewish conspiracy nine years later in  mahathir met with soros and afterward stated that he accepted that soros had not been responsible for the crisis in s the crisis of global capitalism open society endangered soros explained his role in the crisis as follows the financial crisis that originated in thailand in  was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity by the beginning of  it was clear to soros fund management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable we sold short the thai baht and the malaysian ringgit early in  with maturities ranging from six months to a year that is we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates thai baht and malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold subsequently prime minister mahathir of malaysia accused me of causing the crisis a wholly unfounded accusation we were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis on the contrary we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation much too soon as it turned out we left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that mahathir would impose capital controls he did so but much later in  economist paul krugman was critical of soross effect on financial markets nobody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit these new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name my proposed term is soroi in an interview regarding the lates recession soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the s according to soros market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been some kind of an ideological excess in soross view the markets moods—a mood of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimismpessimism with which the markets look at reality—actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially selfreinforcing but eventually unsustainable and selfdefeating boombust sequences or bubbles in reaction to the lates recession he founded the institute for new economic thinking in october  this is a think tank composed of international economic business and financial experts mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system société générale insider trade in  soros was contacted by a french financier named

strategy of accumulating shares in four french companies société générale as well as suez paribas and the compagnie générale délectricité in  the commission des opérations de bourse cob—the french stock exchange regulatory authority conducted an investigation of whether soross transaction in société générale should be considered insider trading soros had received no information from the société générale and had no insider knowledge of the business but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt initial investigations found soros innocent and no charges were brought forward however the case was reopened a few years later and the french supreme court confirmed the conviction on june   but reduced the penalty to € soros denied any wrongdoing saying news of the takeover was public knowledge and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover in december  he appealed to the european court of human rights on various grounds including that the year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing on the basis of article  of the european convention on human rights stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed the court agreed to hear the appeal in october  the court rejected his appeal in a – decision saying that soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws personal life soros has been married three times and divorced twice in  he married annaliese witschak annaliese

views external video george soros the lecture series introduction  general theory of reflexivity  financial markets  open society  capitalism vs open society  all by the open society foundations reflexivity financial markets and economic theory soross writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a near to equilibrium or a far from equilibrium state he argues that when markets are rising or falling rapidly they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium and that the conventional economic theory of the market the efficient market hypothesis does not apply in these situations soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium static disequilibrium and nearequilibrium conditions he has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect reflexivity is based on three main ideas reflexivity is best observed under special conditions where investor bias grows and spreads throughout the investment arena examples of factors that may give rise to this bias include a equity leveraging or b the trendfollowing habits of speculators reflexivity appears intermittently since it is most likely to be revealed under certain conditions ie the character of the equilibrium process is best considered in terms of probabilities investors observation of and participation in the capital markets may at times influence valuations and fundamental conditions or outcomes a recent example of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets lenders began to make more money available to more people in the s to buy houses more people bought houses with this larger amount of money thus increasing the prices of these houses lenders looked at their balance sheets which not only showed that they had made more loans but that their equity backing the loans – the value of the houses had gone up because more money was chasing the same amount of housing relatively thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good and prices rose higher still this was further amplified by public policy in the us home loans were guaranteed by the federal government many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for firsttime home buyers and other financial subsidies such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation these further encouraged house purchases leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards the concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot soros theories were originally dismissed by economists but have received more attention after the  crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the journal of economic methodology the notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of complexity economics as developed at the santa fe institute although soros had not publicised his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the s reflexivity in politics although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets he has also explored its effects in politics he has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the open society in the past were from communism and fascism as discussed in the open society and its enemies by his mentor karl popper the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism he has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the united states is a reflexive phenomenon insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable view of problems in the free market system soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries he blames many of the worlds problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism soros claims to draw a distinction between being a participant in the market and working to change the rules that market participants must follow market predictions soross book the new paradigm for financial markets may  described a superbubble that had built up over the past  years and was ready to collapse this was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster as he states i have a record of crying wolf i did it first in the alchemy of finance in  then in the crisis of global capitalism in  and now in this book so its three books predicting disaster after the boy cried wolf three times  the wolf really came he ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong im only rich because i know when im wrong i basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes i very often used to get backaches due to the fact that i was wrong whenever you are wrong you have to fight or take flight when i make the decision the backache goes away in february  soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated adding that there was no prospect of a nearterm resolution to the crisis we witnessed the collapse of the financial system it was placed on life support and its still on life support theres no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom in january  at an economic forum in sri lanka soros predicted a financial crisis akin to  based on the state of global currency stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking chinese yuan china has a major adjustment problem i would say it amounts to a crisis when i look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in  views on antisemitism and israel when asked about what he thought about israel in the new yorker soros replied that i dont deny the jews to a right to a national existence – but i dont want anything to do with it according to hacked emails released in  soros open society foundation has a selfdescribed objective of “challenging israel’s racist and antidemocratic policies” in international forums in part by questioning israel’s reputation as a democracy he has funded ngos which have been actively critical of israeli policies including groups that campaign for the boycott divestment and sanctions movement against israel soros has been accused of saying that both jews and israel are partially responsible for antisemitism in response to his statement that the administrations of gw bush in the us and ariel sharon in israel were stoking antisemitism he has also said that jews cant overcome antisemitism without giving up on the tribalness on november   at a jewish forum in new york city soros partially attributed a recent resurgence of antisemitism to the policies of israel and the united states and the role of wealthy and influential individuals there is a resurgence of antisemitism in europe the policies of the bush administration and the sharon administration contribute to that its not specifically antisemitism but it does manifest itself in antisemitism as well im critical of those policies if we change that direction then antisemitism also will diminish i cant see how one could confront it directly im also very concerned about my own role because the new antisemitism holds that the jews rule the world as an unintended consequence of my actions i also contribute to that image in a subsequent article for the new york review of books soros emphasized that i do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of israel and i am not blaming jews for antisemitism antisemitism predates the birth of israel neither israels policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for antisemitism at the same time i do believe that attitudes toward israel are influenced by israels policies and attitudes toward the jewish community are influenced by the proisrael lobbys success in suppressing divergent views during a  billion lawsuit against soros by beny steinmetzs israeli company bsg resources which alleged soros used his sway with the government of guinea to freeze the israeli company out of iron ore mining contracts  the lawsuit alleges that soros hostility to israel is a motive for his actions to soros steinmetz’s success as well as his active passionate promotion of israeli life business and culture are anathema” bsgr said in the lawsuit “soros is also well known for his longstanding animus toward the state of israel during an award ceremony for imre kertész soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming “perpetrators of violence” suggesting that this model explained israels behaviour towards the palestinians which led to walkouts and soros being booed in july  israels ministry of foreign affairs released a statement denouncing soros a move that appeared designed to align israel more closely with hungary ahead of a visit to budapest by prime minister benjamin netanyahu israels foreign ministry stated the soros continuously undermines israels democratically elected governments adding that soros funded organizations that defame the jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself views on the us on november   in an interview with the washington post soros said that removing president george w bush from office was the central focus of my life and a matter of life and death he said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat bush if someone guaranteed it soros gave  million to the center for american progress  million to moveonorg and  million to america coming together these groups worked to support democrats in the  election on september   he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech why we must not reelect president bush delivered at the national press club in washington dc the online transcript to this speech received many hits after dick cheney accidentally referred to factcheckorg as factcheckcom in the vice presidential debate causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to soross site his  book the bubble of american supremacy was a forthright critique of the bush administrations war on terror as misconceived and counterproductive and a polemic against the reelection of bush he explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the selfreinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices when soros was asked in  about his statement in the age of fallibility that the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the united states he responded that it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world and i think thats rather shocking for americans to hear the united states sets the agenda for the world and the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda by declaring a war on terror after september  we set the wrong agenda for the world when you wage war you inevitably create innocent victims soros described donald trump as a con man soros expects trump to fail because soros believes trumps ideas are selfcontradictory soros believes trump is preparing for a trade war and expects financial markets to do badly views on europe in october  soros drafted an open letter entitled as concerned europeans we urge eurozone leaders to unite in which he calls for a stronger economic government for europe using federal means common eu treasury common fiscal supervision etc and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the economic crisis the letter was cosigned by javier solana daniel cohnbendit andrew duff emma bonino massimo dalema vaira vikefreiberga soros criticized hungarian prime minister viktor orbán and his handling of the european migrant crisis in  his plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle soros expects that brexit will fail and the premiership of theresa may will last only a short time views on asia soros has expressed concern about the growth of chinese economic and political power saying china has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests they have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well regarding the political gridlock in america he said today china has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the united states in july  soros stated that a strategic partnership between the us and china could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict in january  during an interview at the world economic forum wef in davos soros stated that a hard landing is practically unavoidable chinese state media responded by stating soros’ challenge to the rmb and hong kong dollar are doomed to fail without any doubt views on russia and ukraine in may  soros told cnns fareed zakaria i set up a foundation in ukraine before ukraine became independent from russia and the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now in january  soros said that europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from russia he also urged western countries to expand economic sanctions against russia for its support of separatists in eastern ukraine in january  soros called on the european union to give  billion of bailout money to ukraine in july  soros stated that putins annexation of crimea was a challenge to the prevailing world order specifically the european union he hypothesized that putin wants to destabilize all of ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern ukraine which would then depend on russia for economic support in november  russia banned the open society foundations osf and the open society institute osi two prodemocracy charities founded by soros—stating they posed as threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the russian federation and the security of the state in january   books related to soros renewal of humanitarian education program were burned at vorkuta mining and economic college in the komi republic with  additional books seized for shredding a russian intergovernmental letter released in december  stated that soros charities were forming a perverted perception of history and making ideological directives alien to russian ideology popular wealth and philanthropy for more details on george soros philanthropy see list of projects supported by george soros george soros speaks to the lse alumni society in malaysia as of february  forbes magazine listed soros as the th richest person in the world the worlds richest hedgefund manager and th on its list of the  wealthiest americans with a net worth estimated at  billion soros lost almost  billion in the weeks after the election of republican donald trump as us president in  soros has been active as a philanthropist since the s when he began providing funds to help black students attend the university of cape town in apartheid south africa and began funding dissident movements behind the iron curtain soross philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote nonviolent democratization in the postsoviet states these efforts mostly in central and eastern europe occur primarily through the open society foundations originally open society institute or osi and national soros foundations which sometimes go under other names such as the stefan batory foundation in poland as of  pbs estimated that he had given away a total of  billion the osi says it has spent about  million annually in recent years in  former federal reserve chairman paul volcker wrote in the foreword of soross book the alchemy of finance george soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game the bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become open societies open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but—more important—tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior time magazine in  cited two specific projects— million toward internet infrastructure for regional russian universities and  million for the millennium promise to eradicate extreme poverty in africa—noting that soros had given  million to projects in the us and given away a total of more than  billion other notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern europe help to civilians during the siege of sarajevo and transparency international soros also pledged an endowment of € million to the central european university ceu the nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus and his microfinance bank grameen bank received support from the osicitation needed according to national review online the open society institute gave  in september  to the defense committee of lynne stewart the lawyer who has defended controversial poor and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to ⅓ years in prison for providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy via a press conference for a client an osi spokeswoman said it appeared to us at that time that there was a righttocounsel issue worthy of our support but claimed later requests for support were declined in september  soros pledged  million to the millennium promise led by economist jeffrey sachs to provide educational agricultural and medical aid to help villages in africa enduring poverty the new york times termed this endeavor a departure for soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government but soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance soros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in hungary – and provided a substantial endowment to central european university in budapest the open society foundations has active programs in more than  countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately  million a year legacy and awards soros received honorary doctoral degrees from the new school for social research new york the university of oxford in  the corvinus university of budapest and yale university in  he received the yale international center for finance award from the yale school of management in citation needed as well as an honorary degree in economics from the university of bologna in  the oldest university in the world in  he was inducted into

while baltimore burns the city has proven itself to be yet another staging ground in a long line of scenes involving “violent protests” riots and racial violence following an incident concerning police brutality real or otherwise although the issues that have set off the spark in most of these protests were entirely legitimate government agencies foundations organizations and ngos immediately swooped in to divert the protests into racially charged fit throwing and often violent riots with a carefully orchestrated network that was capable of organizing large numbers of individuals on a moment’s notice and a simultaneous media campaign that cleverly showed violence and riots but ignored peaceful or appropriatelydirected violent acts these organizations were able to turn what could and should have been a national movement into a raciallyoriented hatefilled display of unrestrained destruction with this in mind one might justifiably ask how these organizations might have such an effective network that operates in concert with a national corporate media apparatus in order to wreck legitimate movements and out of those movements create a counterproductive act of mindless fitthrowing the answer is the same as it has often been in europe – the color revolution apparatus and george soros indeed george soros has been heavily involved in the social unrest and movementwrecking activity that has taken place all across the united states in recent months from florida to ferguson and now to baltimore george soros’ foundations have been involved in making sure that not only are american citizens unable to overcome racial divisions with mutual cooperation but that even the racially isolated participants are unable to accomplish anything of substance as kelly riddell of the washington times reported in january  regarding soros’ involvement in ferguson there’s a solitary man at the financial center of the ferguson protest movement no it’s not victim michael brown or officer darren wilson it’s not even the rev al sharpton despite his ubiquitous campaign on tv and the streets rather it’s liberal billionaire george soros who has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit foundations that impacts american politics and policy not unlike what he did with moveonorg mr soros spurred the ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the us according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by the washington times in all mr soros gave at least  million in one year to support alreadyestablished groups that emboldened the grassroots ontheground activists in ferguson according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit open society foundations the financial tether from mr soros to the activist groups gave rise to a combustible protest movement that transformed a oneday criminal event in missouri into a houraday national cause celebre “our dna includes a belief that having people participate in government is indispensable to living in a more just inclusive democratic society” said kenneth zimmerman director of mr soros‘ open society foundations’ us programs in an interview with the washington times “helping groups combine policy research and data collection with community organizing feels very much the way our society becomes more accountable” indeed the open society institute has been promoting “democracy” all over the world if by democracy one means the overthrow of governments unfriendly to angloamerican banking interests and installing new and more corrupt leadership in its place riddell continues by writing sorossponsored organizations helped mobilize protests in ferguson building grassroots coalitions on the ground backed by a nationwide online and social media campaign other sorosfunded groups made it their job to remotely monitor and exploit anything related to the incident that they could portray as a conservative misstep and to develop academic research and editorials to disseminate to the news media to keep the story alive the plethora of organizations involved not only shared mr soros‘ funding but they also fed off each other using content and buzzwords developed by one organization on another’s website referencing each other’s news columns and by creating a social media echo chamber of facebook “likes” and twitter hashtags that dominated the mainstream media and personal online newsfeeds buses of activists from the samuel dewitt proctor conference in chicago from the drug policy alliance make the road new york and equal justice usa from new york from sojourners the advancement project and center for community change in washington and networks from the gamaliel foundation — all funded in part by mr soros — descended on ferguson starting in august and later organized protests and gatherings in the city until late last month all were aimed at keeping the media’s attention on the city and to widen the scope of the incident to focus on interrelated causes — not just the overpolicing and racial discrimination narratives that were highlighted by the news media in august “i went to ferguson in a quest to be in solidarity and stand with the young organizers and affirm their leadership” said kassandra frederique policy manager at the drug policy alliance which was founded by mr soros and which receives  million annually from his foundation she traveled to ferguson in october “we recognized this movement is similar to the work we’re doing at dpa” said ms frederique “the war on drugs has always been to operationalize institutionalize and criminalize people of color protecting personal sovereignty is a cornerstone of the work we do and what this movement is all about” ms frederique works with opal tometi cocreator of blacklivesmatter — a hashtag that was developed after the killing of trayvon martin in florida — and helped promote it on dpa’s news feeds ms tometi runs the black alliance for just immigration a group to which mr soros gave  in  according to the most recent of his foundation’s tax filings “i think blacklivesmatter’s success is because of organizing this was created after trayvon martin and there has been sustained organizing and conversations about police violence since then” said ms frederique “its explosion into the mainstream recently is because it connects all the dots at a time when everyone was lost for words ‘black lives matter’ is liberating unapologetic and leaves no room for confusion” it should be noted that the gamaliel foundation which is described as a “network of grassroots and interracial organizations” is not only funded by george soros it was the foundation where president barack obama began his career as a “community organizer” in chicago obama’s former pastor rev jeremiah wright who drew conservative ire for a fiery sermon condemning america’s actions his famous “goddamn america speech is a trustee of the sorosfunded samuel dewitt proctor conference an organization that sent representatives to ferguson early on in ferguson the use of clergy and ministers became a major part of the social movement as funded by soros as well riddell reveals as much when she writes representatives of sojourners a national evangelical christian organization committed “to faith in action for social justice” attended the weekend gamaliel’s weekend protest event in ferguson the group received  from mr soros in  clergy representatives from the samuel dewitt proctor conference where the rev jeremiah wright serves as a trustee also showed up mr wright was mr obama’s pastor in chicago before some of his racially charged sermons including the phrase “god damn america” forced mr obama to distance himself sdpc received  from mr soros in  during gamaliel’s weekend protest event sunday was deemed “hands up sabbath” where clergy were asked to speak out about racial issues using packets and talking points prepared for them by another religionbased community organizing group pico pico is also supported by the open society foundations according to its website the washington times article also serves to shed light on a number of other more profile “national” organizations funded by soros that descended upon ferguson now explaining some of the reasons that the protest movement on the ground in mo became such a disgraceful failure riddell further demonstrates this by writing larry fellows iii  a missouri native did find his voice in the chaos of ferguson with the help of outside assistance backed by mr soros mr fellows is cofounder of the millennial activists united a key source of video and stories developed in ferguson by youth activists used to inspire other groups nationally mr fellows explained how he started his organization in an interview with the american civil liberties union another sorosbacked entity that sent national representatives to missouri in november “initially it would just be that we would show up for protests and the next day we’d clean up the streets a lot of the same people were out at the protests and going out to lunch and talking about what was happening that became a cycle until a lot of us figured out we needed to have a strategy” mr fellows explained to the aclu which posted the interview in its blog “then a lot of organizers from across the country started to come in to help us do the planning and do the strategizing that helped us start doing it on our own and planning out actions and what our narratives were going to be” he said mau has listed on its website that it has partnered with gamaliel network churches they’ve also received training on civil disobedience from the advancement project — which was given a  grant from mr soros in  “to build a fair and just multiracial democracy in america through litigation community organizing support public policy reform and strategic communications” according to the foundation’s website the advancement project based in washington also arranged the meeting between community organizers in ferguson and mr obama last month to brief him on the situation in ferguson and to set up a task force that examines trust between police and minority communities in addition the advancement project has also dedicated some of its staff to lead organizations in ferguson like the don’t shoot coalition another grassroots group that preaches the same message links to the same facebook posts and “likes” the same articles as dpa aclu hands up coalition obs more and others it should also be noted that the open society institute one of soros’ main ngos has worked closely with mayor rawlingsblake and google in making baltimore one of their “test cities” for smart technology and new fiber cables rawlingsblake has had pleasant things to say about soros in the past while the above information addresses the involvement of blacklivesmatter groups and similar organizations active on the ground inside ferguson as a matter of historical precedent these organizations and similar operations have had a sizable presence inside baltimore in the time leading up to the freddie gray protests and continue to do so as we speak the relevance of the soros connection may seem confusing to many certainly however no one in their right mind will suggest that a man who has made his fortune bankrupting nations and impoverishing their peoples lies awake at night wringing his hands over concerns for black people in america soros is most wellknown for playing a major role in the funding and facilitating of the “bulldozer revolution” in serbia that overthrew slobodan milosevic in  georgia’s “rose revolution” of  the  push to move turkey toward a more islamist governing structure and even the occupy movement in the united states among a great many others – none of which brought anything other than greater misery impoverishment and police state mechanisms to bear on the general public the occupy movement being the only exception still brought nothing to its participants except the opportunity to burn off excess anger and energy along with a few cracked protester skulls it was otherwise an incredible waste of time regardless the methods being used by the soros machine in terms of the blacklivesmatter and other related campaigns across the country are much the same as those used in europe to usher in greater austerity police states and fascism through governmentcoup and social protest – ie a coordinated media campaign to provide the general public with a false perception of events as well as a false narrative the use of social media and slogans and the deployment of “swarming adolescents” in the streets when media campaigns alone are not enough there are other methods that are able to be implemented if need be for instance a mother jones report revealed the fact that in some areas where rioting began there appears to have been a concerted effort on the part of the authorities to create an environment in which riots would be inevitable for example in an instance where it was reported that teens in baltimore attacked police by throwing rocks it was never mentioned that police had corralled these teens – who should have been on their way home – off the bus and into an area in between the mall and the high school according to onlookers it appeared that both the teens and the police were surprised at the situation – the police surprised at the lack of violence and the teens surprised that they were kept from going home eventually rocks and bottles were reportedly thrown at police and the situation deteriorated from there of course the entire story was never fully reported in the mainstream press still while the rocks and bottles may have started from those in the crowd others may justifiably wonder if there were not provocateurs already placed simply waiting to cause violence as soon as the tension had reached a boiling point as it is it is very likely that protesters and police alike were dupes in a devious game consider also the fact that the baltimore authorities despite implementing heavyhanded tactics against high schoolers on their way home allowed criminals thieves and violent thugs to prey upon innocent people private property and communities for quite some time without a serious effort to stop them in fact baltimore mayor stephanie rawlingsblake even openly admitted that the looters were allowed to riot when she stated that “we also gave those who wish to destroy space to do that as well” the police were prevented from actually stopping the riots and were kept largely unequipped as well in other words the riots were both allowed and encouraged until they had reached a boiling point and the national guard was called in of course the color revolution and destabilization is not merely some communiqué presented to a small group of people that organically takes on a life of its own there is an entire science behind the application of a movement of destabilization both when it takes place overseas as well as when it takes place domestically as pottenger and frieson of color revolutions and geopolitics write many are the professions that utilize this type of understanding including but not limited to marketing advertising public relations politics and lawmaking radio television journalism and news film music general business and salesmanship each of them selling branding promoting entertaining sloganeering framing explaining creating friends and enemies arguing likes and dislikes setting the boundaries of good and evil in many cases using their talents to circumvent their audiences’ intellect the real target being emotional oftentimes even subconscious looking beneath the facade of the color revolutionary movement we also find a desirebased behavioral structure in particular one that has been built upon historical lessons offered by social movements and periods of political upheaval it then makes sense that the personnel of such operations include perception managers pr firms pollsters and opinionmakers in the social media through the operational infrastructure these entities work in close coordination with intelligence agents local and foreign activists strategists and tacticians taxexempt foundations governmental agencies and a host of non governmental organizations collectively their job is to make a palace coup of their sponsorship seem like a social revolution to help fill the streets with fearless demonstrators advocating on behalf of a government of their choosing which then legitimizes the sham governments with the authenticity of popular democracy and revolutionary fervor because the operatives perform much of their craft in the open their effectiveness is heavily predicated upon their ability to veil the influence backing them and the longterm intentions guiding their work their effectiveness is predicated on their ability to deceive targeting both local populations and foreign audiences with highlymisleading interpretations of the underlying causes provoking these events with this explanation in mind consider the description provided by ian traynor of the guardian regarding the “revolutions” and “mass movements” which was taking place in ukraine serbia belarus and georgia in  and the time of the writing of his article indeed traynor’s depiction of the methodology used by the foundations ngos and government agencies stirring up dissent and popular revolt is equally illuminating traynor writes in the centre of belgrade there is a dingy office staffed by computerliterate youngsters who call themselves the centre for nonviolent resistance if you want to know how to beat a regime that controls the mass media the judges the courts the security apparatus and the voting stations the young belgrade activists are for hire they emerged from the antimilosevic student movement otpor meaning resistance the catchy singleword branding is important in georgia last year the parallel student movement was khmara in belarus it was zubr in ukraine it is pora meaning high time otpor also had a potent simple slogan that appeared everywhere in serbia in  – the two words “gotov je” meaning “he’s finished” a reference to milosevic a logo of a blackandwhite clenched fist completed the masterful marketing in ukraine the equivalent is a ticking clock also signalling that the kuchma regime’s days are numbered stickers spray paint and websites are the young activists’ weapons irony and street comedy mocking the regime have been hugely successful in puncturing public fear and enraging the powerful these slogans and symbols are the product of mass marketers employed by state departments and intelligence agencies for the sole purpose of destabilizing andor overthrowing a democratically elected or unfavorable to the oligarchygovernment the details and techniques of the manipulation of mass numbers of people have only continued to become more and more advanced and sophisticated particularly with the advent of social media as jonathan mowat wrote as in the case of the new communication technologies the potential effectiveness of angry youth in postmodern coups has long been under study as far back as  dr fred emery then director of the tavistock institute and an expert on the “hypnotic effects” of television specified that the then new phenomenon of “swarming adolescents” found at rock concerts could be effectively used to bring down the nationstate by the end of the s this was particularly the case as dr emery reported in “the next thirty years concepts methods and anticipations” in the group’s “human relations” because the phenomena was associated with “rebellious hysteria” the british military created the tavistock institute as its psychological warfare arm following world war i it has been the forerunner of such strategic planning ever since dr emery’s concept saw immediate application in nato’s use of “swarming adolescents” in toppling french president charles de gaulle in  … in november  case western reserve in cleveland ohio under the aegis of that university’s “program for social innovations in global management” began a series of conferences to review progress towards that strategic objective which was reported on in “human relations” in  there dr howard perlmutter a professor of “social architecture” at the wharton school and a follower of dr emery stressed that “rock video in kathmandu” was an appropriate image of how states with traditional cultures could be destabilized thereby creating the possibility of a “global civilization” there are two requirements for such a transformation he added “building internationally committed networks of international and locally committed organizations” and “creating global events” through “the transformation of a local event into one having virtually instantaneous international implications through massmedia” the american people must quickly learn the formula behind color revolutions destabilizations and the agendas of the world oligarchy before it becomes too late for us all they must learn that simply because “leaders” appear to them attempt to speak the same language and articulate rage does not mean that these leaders are men of the people protests are necessary directed rage may also be necessary but the wanton destruction of communities belonging to you or your neighbors is not only counterproductive it produces rage that will be aimed back at you and justifiably so the entire country is being played like a fiddle baltimore is not an isolated collection of dupes it is a microcosm it is time the american people wise up and become street smart before it is too late sources  tarpley webster g obama the postmodern coup mowat jonathan “a new gladio in action ‘swarming adolescents’” progressive press  pp

society foundations led by george soros has as an objective “challenging israel’s racist and antidemocratic policies” in international forums in part by questioning israel’s reputation as a democracythe documents are available on a website reportedly backed by russia that uses antisemitic stereotypes to attack soros be the first to know  join our facebook page they reveal that open society which was founded and is chaired by the hedge fund billionaire and philanthropist gave close to  million since  to groups advancing the rights of arab israelis with an emphasis in recent years on countering what one document says are israel’s “restrictive measures” against minorities“in recent years the radicalization of public opinion and consecutive israeli right wing governments have resulted in more restrictive measures against palestinians within israel” a sept   review of open society’s arab regional office’s work said it cites as an example the jewish nation state bill advanced by its sponsors to entrench israel’s jewish status but decried by some arab israelis as further marginalizing nonjewish minorities the bill has yet to passamong achievements listed in the sept  document the arab regional office includes increased advocacy by “palestinian citizens of israel” or pci in international forums challenging israel’s “racist” policies in the face of its reputation as a democracythe document advocates the “development of a more organized and efficient pci advocacy and presence in international forums un eu us especially in light of the increasingly limited domestic avenues available for seeking justice”“in shifting to international advocacy pci’s sic are up against israel and its image as a democratic state before the international community therefore palestinian civil society organizations in israel feel the pressure of filling this gap by strengthening their relations with international actors and systems such as the european union and united nations to put their issue on the international agenda” it says“there have been a number of successes in challenging israel’s racist and antidemocratic policies in the international arena and influencing euisrael bilateral negotiations” the document saysthe emails were posted in recent weeks by dc leaks a group bloomberg news in an aug  report quoted security experts as saying is likely

survivor of the holocaust as antiisraelthe soros page on dc leaks’ website in broken english notes soros’ hungarian jewish roots depicting a sinisterlooking soros presiding over an array of news photos of rioting and violence it invokes antisemitic tropes commonplace in russia and eastern europe describing him as a “vampire” managing “puppets” and “slaves” who “spill blood of millions and millions people just to make him even more rich”soros is a major backer of the presidential bid of democratic nominee hillary clinton clinton’s campaign has accused russian intelligence of being

controversial initiative the  democratic constitution calling it one of several “important cooperation efforts among leading oci civil society groups”that document which the review describes as “the most direct and substantive challenge posed by palestinian citizens to their status in the jewish israeli state” was decried by proisrael groups at the time as promoting an outcome that would all but remove israel’s jewish characteradalah was one of the drafting bodies and the subsequent controversy led the new israel fund in  to revise its funding criteria to reject any group that “works to deny the right of the jewish people to sovereign selfdetermination within israel” the nif policy was not retroactive and it still funds adalahthe release of the open society documents was overshadowed by
