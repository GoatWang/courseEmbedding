references for pricing research or register for free alerts to track  artists already a member  sign in here x liu xianfang  born  liu xianfang is activelives in china  liu xianfang is known for painting key considerations for pricing art expand all  collapse all is the artwork an original  vs a photo or a print multiple    expand if you are certain you have an original oil watercolor or sculpture  or a signed andor numbered work by the artist proceed with the other valuation questions  if you are unsure we suggest you let a local frame shop or art gallery help you determine if you have an original work versus a reproduction  prints photographs and reproductions are mediums where we regret we are unable to help with valuation who is the artist    expand look for a legible signature or notation on the artwork including the back and also on the bottom if it is a sculpture  if you are unable to determine the artist’s name you might provide photos or jpgs to dealers and auction houses not museums carrying similar works  click here for a link to find information about styles and groups of interest which may help you to discover your artist whats the artwork size subject matter year painted    expand the size of an artwork is very often a factor in its value   in addition some artists are especially known for certain subject matter   if an artwork contains quintessential details it may be more valuable   the year the work was painted is relevant as well as many artists have their peak most valuable periods is the artwork a sculpture    expand in addition to looking for notation of a signature on the work it is important to note any markings identifying the foundry and the edition number of the work   all else equal a sculpture will likely be more valuable if it is one of only  cast as opposed to being one of  what is the condition of the artwork    expand the condition of your artwork will make a significant difference to its value   look for any rips or signs of inpainting or overcleaning   has the work been relined have the colors faded or is there water damage   often an ideal situation is when an artwork has never been touched up even though it might need cleaning badly   you may need advice from a restorer to determine what condition your art is in especially if it is an older work what is the provenance ie history of ownership    expand knowing the lineage of ownership and exhibition history can add to the value of your artwork   useful to establishing provenance or history of an artwork include  the original bill of sales correspondence about the piece exhibition stickers attached to the frame notes by the artist sometimes found on the back of the work statements from people who knew the artist or circumstances of the painting   these must mention the painting specifically enough for it to be identified not in vague or broad terms what facts support pricing ie auction records signatures dealer interest etc    expand use our search tools to find your artist  visitors who become subscriber members have access to all the valuable data listed below auction records and results  look for auction history or auctions upcoming information for your artist   please note  some artists may not have any historical or upcoming auction records so please study our summary menu for each artist before assuming we have data biographical info  look at the biography link for background information about your artist their training exhibits etc dealers and galleries  look for the dealers who carry your artist and their for sale or wanted ads and consider contacting them for their opinions on valuation museums  look at the list of museums that might list your artist for a sense of where heshe might stand in importance in the museum art world we do not however recommend contacting museums directly with inquiries unless you are certain your artwork is of museum quality publications  look for the books and magazines that have included your artist the more listed the better general facts  look at the quick facts to find a broad overview about your artist our auction records go back close to  years and cover the prices an artist may have obtained at auction including presale estimates sizes titles and images of the artworks summary from the steps above hopefully you have learned to appreciate and enjoy your artwork even more   in addition our records can provide the first step in the process of determining the value of your artwork   many think of askart as the artists bluebook   however please be aware that your own research may not be a substitute for the type of formal analysis and appraisal that can come from contracting a qualified professional appraisal service   appraisal results will vary according to the intended purpose of the appraisal   the two most common purposes for appraisal are “fair market value” the value typically applied to the donation of an artwork to a qualifying nonprofit art institution and “replacement value” which is typically required for insurance purposes   but there are various other types of appraisal purposes each with their own appropriate corresponding methodologies   only a written report prepared by a qualified professional appraiser may serve as a legal document   therefore while your own research initiative on askart is encouraged as a learning experience askart cannot be held responsible for nor can it validate the conclusions you or others may have derived   if you decide to sell your artwork you have many options including doing so directly through askart’s classified ads for private parties see details or by directly contacting any of our dealers or auction houses that have indicated their
