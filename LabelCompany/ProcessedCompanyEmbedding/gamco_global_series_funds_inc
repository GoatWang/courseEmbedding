on january   the court entered an order estopping vivendi from contesting the same elements as to the mutual funds plaintiffs’ order gamco investors inc v vivendi sa  civ  sas jan   ecf no  the parties have stipulated as to the amount of damages that would be awarded should plaintiffs prevail at trial stipulation and order dated february   gamco investors inc v vivendi sa  civ  sas ecf no — in this action the only remaining issue to be determined is whether defendant  the term “mutual funds plaintiffs” refers to gamco global series funds inc gabelli capital asset fund the gabelli value fund inc the gabelli asset fund the gabelli global multimedia trust inc and the gabelli equity trust inc the gamco mathers fund the gabelli convertible and income securities fund inc and gamco international growth fund inc are no longer pursuing any damages in this action and the claims of those funds will therefore be dismissed  case cvsas document  filed  page  of  vivendi has successfully rebutted the presumption of reliance relied upon by plaintiffs in this case that remaining issue can be decided one of three ways each one being sufficient for vivendi to prevail i did plaintiffs purchase vivendi adrs without regard to whether their market price was an accurate measure of their intrinsic value ii would plaintiffs have purchased vivendi adrs had they known vivendi’s alleged true liquidity condition iii if plaintiffs relied on the efficiency of the market was such reliance reasonable under the circumstances here i did plaintiffs purchase vivendi adrs without regard to whether their market price was an accurate measure of their intrinsic value a applicable law to prove reliance the plaintiff must show that but for the material misleading statement or omission it would not have transacted in the security id this is sometimes referred to as “transaction causation” dura pharmaceuticals inc v broudo  us    in basic v levinson  us    “basic” the supreme court held that under certain circumstances a plaintiff is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that it relied on the efficiency of the market the presumption means that investors rely on the market price of a security as an accurate measure of its intrinsic value sj op  wl  at  citing teamsters local  freight div pension fund v bombardier inc  fd   n d cir  “teamsters” plaintiffs plead such reliance in this case this presumption of  gamco’s amended complaint ¶  gamco investors inc v vivendi sa  civ  lsas july   ecf no  mutual funds plaintiffs’ complaint ¶  gamco global series funds inc v vivendi sa  civ sas sept   ecf no   case cvsas document  filed  page  of  reliance can be rebutted by any showing that “severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price received or paid by the plaintiff or plaintiff’s decision to trade at a fair market price” id at  specifically the defendant can rebut the presumption of reliance by showing either that “the alleged misrepresentation did not impact the market price” or that “the investor did not ‘rely on the market price of the security as an accurate measure of its intrinsic value” s op  wl  at  citing teamsters  fd at  n it is not enough for a plaintiff to have merely considered the market price of the security in question in their purchase decisions since every investor presumably pays “the market price” every investor who purchased a security on the open market under such theory would always be regarded as having relied upon the integrity of market price in making the purchase because at some point she would have had to “consider” the market price when she made the purchase at the market price but that is not what the presumption means see sj op  wl  at  the cases cited by gamco “do not imply that absent insider information the fraud on the market presumption is irrebuttable as against any investor who purchased a security at market value” to be entitled to the presumption of reliance on the efficiency of the market price the plaintiff has to have relied on the market price as “an accurate measure of the security’s intrinsic value” sj op  wl  at  citing teamsters  fd  at  n b summary of facts during the relevant period gamco was a wholly owned subsidiary of gabelli asset management inc “gbl” and an investment advisor that “provides investment advice gamco’s summary judgment reply memorandum gamco investors inc v vivendi sa  civ  sas dec   ecf no  “gamco reply br”  case cvsas document  filed  page  of  to a broad array of clients” undisputed see joint pretrial order ¶  undisputed facts “jpto” gamco was an advisor to the mutual funds plaintiffs alpert dep  gbl’s chairman and ceo was mario gabelli undisputed see jpto gabelli  company was the research arm of gbl and performs research for gamco and other parts of the gbl organization including the mutual funds plaintiffs jamieson dep  gbl held daily morning meetings during which gabelli  company securities analysts presented to portfolio managers the results of their research on the companies they covered woodson dep    vivendi was the subject of some of these meetings rittenberry dep  plaintiffs’ portfolio managers made the decisions about what stocks to buy and sell based on research provided by gabelli  company analysts woodson dep    in making their purchase decisions plaintiffs did not rely on the market price as an “accurate measure of securities’ intrinsic value” rather they used a company’s private market value “pmv” which is the value an informed industrialist would pay to own the assets of the company in a private transaction woodson dep  gabelli dep  plaintiffs’ analysts calculated pmvs using a template created by mario gabelli in which the analyst breaks down a company into business segments and values each segment based on what the analyst thinks a reasonable buyer would pay for that segment as a separate entity in the private market rittenberry dep    the market price of a security is a factor in plaintiffs’ calculation of a company’s pmv rittenberry  alpert dep  plaintiffs consider that a company’s pmv not the market price represents the “real true intrinsic value” of the company’s securities woodson dep  alpert dep  in fact plaintiffs in their publications and testimony refer to the stock market as “mr market” who was described as “irrational” “emotional” and subject to “euphoria and  case cvsas document  filed  page  of  depression” exs d f n woodson dep  plaintiffs’ core investment philosophy is to purchase securities whose market prices are at substantial discounts to their intrinsic pmvs if there is also a “catalyst” that might cause the market prices to rise to the pmvs in the future typically a period of between two and five years exs j g bd be rittenberry dep  alpert dep  the bigger the difference between market price of a security and its intrinsic value ie pmv the more likely plaintiffs would purchase the security rittenberry dep  in addition to gamco all the mutual funds plaintiffs that purchased vivendi adrs were valueoriented funds that used the pmv methodology in making investment decisions alpert dep  exs e aq ar plaintiffs specifically relied on the pmv methodology in purchasing vivendi adrs plaintiffs calculated vivendi’s pmv rittenberry dep   see eg ex s and concluded that vivendi was trading below its pmv rittenberry dep  jamieson  woodson dep  in fact plaintiffs repeatedly used vivendi in presentations to shareholders and actual and prospective customers as an illustration of a company whose securities were trading at substantial discounts to their pmvs exs  n t the evidence clearly shows that during the period october   through august   the “relevant period” plaintiffs relied on the pmv methodology and only on that methodology in making purchase decisions with respect to vivendi adrs and did not rely on vivendi adrs’ market price as “an accurate measure of their intrinsic value”  case cvsas document  filed  page  of  ii would plaintiffs have purchased vivendi adrs had they known vivendi’s alleged true liquidity condition a applicable law to establish reliance plaintiffs must show that but for the materially misleading statement or omission they “would not have transacted in the security” sj op  wl  at  dura pharmaceuticals  us at  plaintiffs’ argument that vivendi must show that the plaintiffs would have purchased vivendi adrs at the same price had it known of the fraud gamco reply br at   is misplaced plaintiffs cited only one decision in this circuit for such requirement gamco’s reply memorandum of law at  citing lawrence v philip morris cos inc no  civ   wl  at  edny jan   but kline v wolf  fd  d cir  the second circuit decision cited by lawrence for support in fact held that the defendant need only show that “even if plaintiff had known of the alleged misrepresentation it would still have purchased the stock” kline  fd at  see also dura pharmaceuticals  us at  the fraud on the market presumption “nonconclusively presumes that that plaintiffs have relied upon the misrepresentation as long as they would not have bought the share in its absence price is not mentioned in either of these cases plaintiffs’ postdisclosure purchases of the security in question are relevant in evaluating whether they would have purchased the security had they known about the fraud see in re safeguard scientifics  frd   ed pa  the cases cited by gamco concerning postdisclosure purchases gamco’s reply br at  only “hold that post disclosure purchases of securities do not necessarily rebut the fraud on the market presumption as a matter of law” sj op  wl  at  emphasis in the original as this court  case cvsas document  filed  page  of  noted they “do not imply that postdisclosure purchases are never relevant to the plaintiffs reliance” id b summary of facts in the class action relied upon by plaintiffs here for collateral estoppel purposes vivendi was found to have “misstated or omitted its true liquidity risk” class trial verdict form table a however vivendi’ s liquidity condition or its liquidity risk were not part of and did not affect plaintiffs’ decisions to purchase vivendi adrs plaintiffs purchased vivendi adrs during the relevant period because they believed that they were trading below the company’s “real true intrinsic value” the pmv jamieson  rittenberry dep   woodson dep  andrew rittenberry plaintiffs’ analyst responsible for calculating vivendi’s pmv and offering investment recommendations about vivendi believed that vivendi had a “liquidity crisis” “in the spring of ” but it did not affect his investment recommendation on vivendi rittenberry dep   in fact he believed that “in terms of what the asset value of the company is vivendi’s supposed liquidity crisis doesn’t affect it in any way whatsoever” rittenberry dep  as explained by rittenberry mario gabelli is a “very longterm investor” who would not be concerned with “noise” such as a company’s liquidity condition rittenberry dep   further according to plaintiffs’ expert dr blame nye in testimony considered by the class action jury vivendi’s alleged true liquidity condition began to be revealed on january   and continued to be revealed through august   undisputed see jpto yet mario gabelli still believed that vivendi was undervalued by june   and noted that “his view of vivendi’s assets had not changed” by july   ex aj gabelli dep  in fact rittenberry never gave a “sell” recommendation on vivendi securities during the relevant period even when vivendi’s allegedly misstated or omitted liquidity risk  case cvsas document  filed  page  of  was being revealed to the market rittenberry dep   the evidence clearly shows that plaintiffs would have purchased vivendi adrs had they known of vivendi’s alleged true liquidity condition in fact even if the law requires a defendant to show that the plaintiff would have purchased the securities at the same price in order to rebut the presumption of reliance vivendi would be able to carry that burden because vivendi’s liquidity condition— the very information alleged to have been misstated or omitted—did not affect and would not have affected plaintiffs’ private market valuation of vivendi plaintiffs would still have purchased vivendi adrs at the same price that point is further supported by the fact that plaintiffs actually increased their investments in vivendi adrs after vivendi’s alleged true liquidity condition began to be revealed ee jpto exs av aw ax ay in fact plaintiffs made their largest oneday purchase of vivendi adrs on july   which according to dr nye was one of the days on which vivendi’s alleged true liquidity condition was being revealed to the market exs av aw ax ay this further confirms not only that vivendi’s liquidity condition did not affect plaintiffs’ private market valuation of vivendi adrs but that they would have purchased and did purchase vivendi adrs at market price even after they knew of vivendi’s alleged true liquidity condition  case cvsas document  filed  page  of  iii if plaintiffs relied on the efficiency of the market was such reliance reasonable under the circumstances here a applicable law in addition to taking advantage of the presumption of reliance the plaintiff must also show that its reliance was reasonable s op  wl  at  citing starr ex rd estate of sampson v georgeson shareholder inc  fd   d cir  “an investor may not justifiably rely on a misrepresentation if through minimal diligence the investor should have discovered the truth” id at  quoting brown v ef hutton group inc  fd   d cir  “brown” the second circuit considers the following list of relevant factors in evaluating whether a plaintiffs reliance is reasonable  the sophistication and expertise of the plaintiff in financial and securities matters  the existence of longstanding business or personal relationship  access to the relevant information  the existence of a fiduciary relationship  concealment of the fraud  the opportunity to detect the fraud  whether the plaintiff initiated the stock transaction or sought to expedite the transaction and  the generality or specificity of the misrepresentations ici at  quoting brown  fd at   b summary of facts gamco is a sophisticated investor with strong industry knowledge and research capabilities as an investor advisor gamco employed between  and  people during the relevant period to research and manage its securities on behalf of its clients jamieson dep   mario gabelli is a sophisticated investor and is particularly knowledgeable about various industries including cable broadcasting gabelli dep   rittenberry the gbl analyst who tracks vivendi and other major companies in the vivendi does not have any evidence—and therefore will not contend—that plaintiffs in fact possessed nonpublic corrective infonnation about vivendi’s alleged misstatements  case cvsas document  filed  page  of  media industry described his responsibility as to “be an expert in the media industry what’s going on in the industry what’s going on at all the companies what the dynamics are within the industry” and to “report those and discuss those with  clients of the brokerdealer and the principal client who is gamco” rittenberry dep  his goal of being an expert in the media industry was to “understand the industry better than the average investor on wall street” and to “understand the dynamics in the industry and the company better than the average investor” rittenberry dep  furthermore plaintiffs had private communications with vivendi including vivendi’s ceo jeanmarie messier and cfo guillaume hannezo during the relevant period in february  mario gabelli and marc gabelli had a meeting with messier undisputed see jpto marc gabelli wrote to messier afterwards that “the meeting served well in crystallizing messier’s strategy” ex i mario gabelli wrote to messier afterwards that messier “shared with us the silhouette of the longterm issues that vivendi faces” ex y mario gabelli and marc gabelli also met messier at the allen  company conference in sun valley in  ex r on april   mario gabelli marc gabelli and rittenberry had a private meeting with messier and hannezo exs ag ah mario gabelli wrote to messier afterwards that “andy rittenberry marc gabelli and i have many questions about vivendi’s strategy in an everchanging world and are delighted that the door is open to us to ask about it” ex ah lastly rittenberry listened to vivendi conference calls attended vivendi’ s investor conferences and communicated with vivendi’ s investor relations personnel eileen mclaughlin and laura martin over the phone and via emails during the relevant period rittenberry dep   during his communications with mclaughlin and martin rittenberry asked questions such as “why was vivendi’s ebitda up x percent last quarter” and “you said  case cvsas document  filed  page  of  on the conference call about your guidance why — what is your guidance again” and had them “walk him through some of the things on vivendi’s balance sheet and tell him why certain things are moving up and down and why this jump versus that jump” rittenberry dep   as a result plaintiffs had extensive knowledge about vivendi for example rittenberry was able to “dig out” vivendi’s debt numbers from its filings when he initially “couldn’t get the numbers to add up” exs ac rittenberry dep  he later explained to eileen mclaughlin “i do not think anyone was misled in any way anyone who knows that their sic is a difference in the us and french gaap should have dug into the filings talked to you guys for  minutes and figured out the answers” ex ad similarly before february   rittenberry already knew that vivendi did not have access to the entire cash flow of certain of its subsidiaries rittenberry dep  he commented on his “vivendi model” “these jokers only have minority positions in some units yet they consolidate all of it and act like they have access to the cash flow which of course they don’t they only have voting control” ex ab even though there is no evidence that plaintiffs in fact possessed nonpublic corrective information about vivendi’ s misstatements plaintiffs as sophisticated investors who had extensive knowledge of vivendi and private communications with vivendi’s management could have discovered vivendi’s alleged true liquidity condition through minimal due diligence assuming that it would have made any difference to their purchase decisions it would have been easy for mario gabelli and andrew rittenberry to have explored that issue with vivendi’s ceo and cfo in one of their private meetings but there is no evidence that they even raised the subject plaintiffs’ failure to utilize gamco’s sophistication resources and access to vivendi  case cvsas document  filed  page  of  to discover vivendi’ s alleged true liquidity condition through minimal due diligence renders their purported reliance on vivendi’ s alleged misstatements by virtue of the presumption of reliance on the efficiency of the market unreasonable  case cvsas document  filed  page  of  iv conclusion for the above reasons vivendi has successfully rebutted the presumption of reliance the reliance element of plaintiffs’ claims under section b of the securities exchange act and rule  ob is not established and consequently plaintiffs’ claims must fail dated february  new york new york respectfully submitted cravath swaine  moore llp by paul saunders of counsel daniel slifkin
