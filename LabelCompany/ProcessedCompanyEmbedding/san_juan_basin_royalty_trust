deuce longshort equity value special situations eventdrivensummarysjts lack of economical projects ensures production declines and lower royalty distributionsthe unit fair value is between  and  assuming the current oil and natural gas forward contractslower natural gas prices will keep a cap on the potential for sjts upsidetiming is everything for san juan basin royalty trust san juan basin royalty trust nysesjt is a trust that consists of a  net overriding royalty interest on the oil and gas production of properties in the san juan basin of northwestern new mexico the properties account for  gross  net producing acres in san juan rio arriba and sandoval counties there are  gross  net wells of which   net are natural gas producing all of the acreage is held by production and has been classified as developed but each formation has not been fully developed the natural gas price curve drives the value of sjt the unit price has declined more than  during the past eight years due to the drop in commodity prices and the downturn in production sjts upside is limited due to a mcf natural gas price environment declining developed reserves and low capital investment eia projects natural gas prices remain under mcf for the next  years the price for natural gas drives the shortterm value for sjt and a sustained period of higher or lower prices determines the amount of product that can be extracted in the future the second point directly impacts the amount of developed reserves and the level of capital investment to be deployed in the future according to the eia natural gas prices are expected to remain near or under mcf for the next  years developed reserves developed reserves are important in determining the remaining production life of the underlying properties of the trust below is a table of the developed reserves stated in the last five k filings and it is a reconciliation of proved reserved quantities that are attributed to the royalty it appears as if sjts developed reserves are declining quickly in a submcf market notice that the stated reserves for natural gas in years  and  stayed at the same level even though average price increased by  meanwhile production also remained the same so  production was replaced by a  increase in the average natural gas price natural gas prices increased another  in  which resulted in a net gain in developed reserves of approximately  mcf after accounting for  production lack of capital investment will keep production in decline capital investment is needed to develop new wells or to implement new technologies to drive production conocophillips nysecop is the current operator of the underlying properties and it does not have a plan for significant capital investment in the near future its reasoning is due to the lack of economics in the san juan basin natural gas production in the san juan basin has been on the decline since  even with the nontraditional techniques that are common practice today state of new mexico oil conservation division data   to  valuing the san juan basin royalty trust sjt appears to be overvalued assuming that developed reserves were around  mmcf at the beginning of  this is assuming the henry hub price strip for the first five years followed by mcf for the remaining period of the trust at these levels the trust has an expected life of  to  years a  decline in production was assumed per annum based on a q comparison of  and  production data administrative expenses where increased by  while production expenses were constant to q  levels on a per mcf basis under these assumptions sjts fair value is between  and  per unit disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i
