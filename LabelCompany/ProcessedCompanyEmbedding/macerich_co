wrote off m that it invested in withme a company that promised to bring online sellers into physical spaces june   pm shops at brickell city centre facing an evergrowing threat from ecommerce mall landlords across the country are trying to counter their falling retail revenues by making bets on tech startups in recent months macerich co simon property group westfield corp and cbl  associates properties have all taken venture capitalstyle risks into clickstobricks ventures the wall street journal reported but it’s a strategy that comes with heaps of risk macerich for example wrote off  million that it invested in withme a company that promised to bring online sellers into physical retail spaces with popup shops opening in six malls in california oregon virginia and illinois the cost of the buildouts was more than macerich anticipated according to the journal “they really built themselves as being the bridge between clicks and bricks which had it turned out to be that it would have been a wonderful business” macerich ceo art coppolla told the newspaper some of its other investments in techoriented tenants and retailers total about  million and have been more successful mall owners have also looked to improving their customers’ smartphone experiences to compete with ecommerce giants like amazon which last week announced it will buy whole foods for  billion breaking into brickandmortar in a big way in  cbl had a pilot program to promote beacons instore devices that engage with mobile apps to offer locationbased discounts and coupons to customers but mall landlords say it’s difficult to gauge the lifespan of firms and products like withme “we want to make sure we’re not jumping onto a bandwagon on technology that’s going to be obsolete in  months” said

sharefacebooktwitterlinkedingoogle stumbleupontumblrdeliciouscustomer showcase the macerich companythe challengefounded in  the macerich company macerich has become one of the largest owners and operators of regional shopping malls in the united states the companys proactive growth and management strategies are at the heart of its success but until recently its property management practices were slowed by dependence on paperbased colorcoded property plans since turning to autodesk mapguide and oracle solutions to generate colorcoded plans online macerich now has the information it needs to make better faster decisions saving thousands of hours each year in the decisionmaking process a dominant forcemacerichs business strategy is simple purchase leading regional malls and turn them into dominant regional malls through smart redevelopment leasing and marketing practices with its occupancy rates and tenant sales consistently among the highest in the industry the strategy is an undisputed success at macerich we strive to be a great company in general not just within our industry explains jp jones macerichs chief information officer were always looking for innovative ways improve our processes and technology where many in the industry are still using highlighters and spreadsheets to color code property plans were doing it instantly with autodesk mapguide its helping us to carry out our business strategy even more effectively as is often the case innovation came hand in hand with unfamiliar technology embracing autodesk mapguide meant that macerichs it staff needed to learn how to integrate graphical data with tabular data so macerich turned to the autodesk mapguide experts at autodesk consulting to lead the implementation after autodesk consulting implemented the solution the autodesk team worked alongside our developers to ensure a smooth transition says lori andrade a business analyst with macerich the process was very collaborative and we learned a great deal about different ways to use and represent data the autodesk team made sure we got the solution we wanted and the knowledge to keep enhancing it a slow static plan coloring processthe practice of color coding property plans has long been an important—if somewhat lowtech—part of retail property management traditionally a leasing or property manager used a highlighter to mark up a paper plan of a property based on the criteria that need to be analyzed or illustrated different colors are used to represent where a particular store stands in relation other stores in the property for instance a colorcoded lease plan—visually depicting different lease expiration dates in different colors—is used to analyze and account for upcoming vacancies in a property in the leasing process a lease plan that is colored based on sales volume by location and store type can be used to sell a potential tenant on leasing a location colored plans are a great tool for understanding and illustrating whats happening or needs to happen with a property says andrade the easier they are to create the easier they are to use as a proactive decisionmaking or leasing toolbefore turning to autodesk mapguide the lease plan colorcoding process at macerich was incredibly tedious employees who needed a colored plan created each one individually using a black and white paper plan highlighters and tabular data not merely slow the plans were out of date as soon as the ink dried because it was so timeconsuming to color plans for presentations leasing staffers were hampered in their ability to create as many highquality custom plans as they would have liked and on the enterprise level colorcoded lease plans for every macerich property were only updated on a quarterly basis were in a dynamic business but the colored paper plans we used were completely static limiting our ability to manage proactively says jones our oracle database contained the realtime data we needed for over  individual leases but in a tabular form we needed a faster way to turn reports and leasing data into colorcoded plans the solution choosing the right solutionin  macerich acquired westcor another owner and operator of regional malls with jp jones as its cio westcor had adopted a digital solution several years prior when jones became the cio of macerich he decided it was time for macerich to throw away its highlighters although the solution westcor used was better and faster than coloring plans by hand the solution wasnt compatible with macerichs oracle property manager database jones says we collect over  data points per lease in our oracle database and we wanted a solution that could use that wealth of data to build colorcoded and interactive floor plansready to adopt a digital solution the macerich team evaluated three plan colorcoding products including autodesk mapguide the decisionmaking team was impressed with the wide array of processes such as facilities management infrastructure maintenance and land use planning for which companies and governments were utilizing autodesk mapguide but it was autodesk mapguides ability to integrate with oracle technology that sold macerich on the autodesk solution autodesk mapguide is a very dynamic tool notes jones and because mapguide is designed to integrate seamlessly with oracle database technology we thought it was the perfect vehicle for making our data more dynamic the implementation autodesk consulting deliversits technology choice made macerich assembled an implementation team to carry out its vision autodesk consulting chosen for its strong methodology and expertise with both graphical and tabular data led the autodesk mapguide implementation from the beginning at every phase of the project from defining the requirements to designing the user interface and building the application framework to knowledge transfer the autodesk consulting team took a collaborative approach and worked closely with macerichs it department and end users two other key players also collaborated with macerich and autodesk consulting on the project already on hand to work with macerichs oracle property manager database oracle consulting created the data structures and cadsoft consulting a provider of technology services to design professionals prepared the cad standard and graphical dataone of the key challenges on the project was ensuring that the solution could develop meaningful data for each of macerichs properties without propertybyproperty customization in terms of revenue and performance each property in macerichs portfolio is distinct and has unique targets for instance rents and sales per square foot can vary widely by region to account for these differences autodesk consulting customized the solution to analyze information dynamically and to generate performancebased color legends automatically by averaging the lease and sales information coming from our oracle database autodesk mapguide creates meaningful lease plan legends onthefly says jones so in a colorcoded lease plan red means take action and blue means okay across all our properties autodesk consulting really understood our business needs and made sure the solution met them eager to deliver its integrated solution to employees quickly macerich gave the implementation team just nine weeks to develop the first release the team was up to the task autodesk consulting held weekly demonstrations with the macerich team soliciting its approval for design choices at every stage of the process this allowed for nimble course corrections while keeping the project moving forward quickly and effectively according to jones autodesk consulting brought a consistent and rigorous methodology to every phase of the implementation because the roles were well defined at the outset we never had a conflict around scope everyone on the project was focused and delivered on schedule and on budget view largerimage courtesy of the macerich company managing in full colorfollowing its rapid implementation macerich unveiled its autodesk mapguide solution dubbed the macerich interactive lease plan in dramatic fashion at a meeting of clevel executives the presenter lori andrade only had a few hours to learn the product but thanks to autodesk mapguides easeofuse and the autodesk consulting teams skills she was well prepared our executive team is very visual so it was exciting to see their reaction to the solution says andrade they dove right into the application during the meeting we created various views of a property and identified areas of concern you cant do that onthefly analysis with tabular data or handcolored lease plans the solution was rolled out to macerich employees with the ability to run six different types of reports each containing multiple data parameters for instance a property manager can create a colorcoded lease plan that references information such as expiration dates rent or sales data were already developing additional reports based on user feedback reports jones from a property or facility management perspective the autodesk mapguide solution gives our employees a new way to analyze and understand performance across a property in leasing meetings the colorcoded plans are a quick way to illustrate why a specific location might be ideal for a businessmacerichs smooth autodesk mapguide implementation set the stage for its successful adoption of the solution macerich attributes much of that success to autodesk consultings ability to convey its autodesk mapguide expertise the rest of the team autodesk consulting was very organized approachable and responsive says andrade there was a real knowledge transfer at every stage of the implementation processsold on the value of visual information for its leasing and property management employees macerich plans to roll out autodesk dwf composer a tool for sharing and annotating design files macerichs leasing and property management staff will use the tool to notate designs to speed presentation creation with dwf composer our leasing managers will be able to mark up designs and demonstrate the potential of our retail spaces to prospective tenants during the lease negotiation process says andrade also since composer is compatible with autocad® it will facilitate updates to our lease plans by our cad designers its going to streamline and clarify some of the more detailoriented aspects of the leasing process the result  hours saved annually and improved analysisthe autodesk mapguide solution is not just a great fit with the macerichs proactive management philosophy but its also saving the companys employees thousands of hours annually according to jones our autodesk mapguide solution is helping us to make profitable decisions and find new opportunities such as advantageous tenant moves more quickly by giving us better visibility into the data in our oracle database compared to coloring lease plans by hand each quarter our autodesk mapguide solution is saving us  hours annually autodesk consultings expertise and strong methodology played a key role in the success of our solutionhe adds autodesk mapguide is also helping us to create more plans more often were now updating all our lease plans on a weekly instead of a quarterly basis the solution helps us to explore and understand things like why sales might be low in one area of a property these kinds of analyses were very timeconsuming before our mapguide implementation for more

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf

with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
