fitch rates harleydavidson motorcycle trust   business wire fitch rates harleydavidson motorcycle trust  january    pm eastern standard time chicagobusiness wirefitch ratings assigns the following ratings to harleydavidson motorcycle trust   class a assetbacked notes fsf  class aa assetbacked notes aaasf outlook stable  class ab assetbacked notes aaasf outlook stable  class a assetbacked notes aaasf outlook stable and  class a assetbacked notes aaasf outlook stable key rating drivers improving credit quality the weighted average wa fair isaac corporation fico score is  in comparison to  in  nr and  in  the last fitchrated transaction additionally the pool has less subprime collateral than the last few transactions sufficient credit enhancement structure initial hard credit enhancement ce in  is decreased from recent transactions but is sufficient to cover stressed expected lifetime cnl for the class a notes fitchs base case loss proxy for this transaction is  strong portfolio performance managed portfolio and securitization delinquencies and losses in  have continued to trend below  vintages the stronger performance has been driven by the stabilizing us economy and the underwriting changes undertaken by hdcc in late  stable corporate health hdcc has exhibited good capabilities as an originator underwriter and servicer of its managed portfolio and securitizations harleydavidson financial services inc hdfs the parent of hdcc is rated fa and its parent hog is rated a both with stable longterm ratings outlooks fitch deems hdcc an adequate servicer for this transaction legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of hdcc would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce cnl levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of ce and remaining loss coverage levels available to the notes decreased ce may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions depending on the extent of the decline in coverage hence fitch conducts sensitivity analysis by stressing a transactions initial base case cnl assumption by x and x and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes the x and x increases of the base case cnl represent moderate and severe stresses respectively and are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected deterioration of a trusts performance key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the presale report dated jan   fitchs analysis of the representations and warranties rw of this transaction can be

eastern standard time new yorkbusiness wirefitch ratings has affirmed four outstanding classes of the harleydavidson motorcycle trust  a full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release key rating drivers the rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and loss performance with cumulative net losses at  currently the collateral pool continues to perform within fitchs expectations based on the current structure and credit enhancement the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the current ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documents rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiple levels for the transaction lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage the notes exhibit a slight decline in loss coverage under a backended loss timing scenario however the probability of such a scenario is considered remote given seasoning growth and historical loss timing patterns in fitchs initial review of the transaction the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a x increase of fitchs base case loss expectation and moderate sensitivity to a x increase to date the transaction has exhibited solid performance with losses well within fitchs initial expectations in addition increasing credit enhancement levels has resulted in rising multiples as such a strong material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pools to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings use of thirdparty due

harleydavidson she bought a  softail breakout from milwaukee harleydavidson she explains how she came to be an harleydavidson rider april    comments share related coverage harley ceo says increased competition is the ‘new normal’ by rick barrett of the journal sentinel april    harleydavidson loves millennials no doubt about it with much of the companys marketing aimed at motorcycle buyers ages  do the millennials love harley back it looks that way as the worlds largest manufacturer of heavyweight bikes says its the market leader in sales of new onroad motorcycles to young adults in  for the eighth straight year harley was the no  seller of new highway motorcycles in the united states to adults ages  it was also the top seller of those bikes to women africanamericans and hispanics as well as caucasian men ages plus according to motorcycle registration data harley says its strategy to focus on growth among outreach customers lines up well with us population trends the millennial generation continues to grow as immigration adds to the group millennials now number  million surpassing the  million baby boomers ages  according to the pew research center thats the challenge and the opportunity for harley and other motorcycle manufacturers that are well established with the boomers but must bridge the generation gap to the millennials in  onethird of new harleydavidson motorcycle purchasers had never owned a bike before we continue to sell more harleydavidson motorcycles to todays young adults than we sold to baby boomers when they were young adults harley ceo matt levatich said saturday at the companys annual shareholders meeting held at the harleydavidson museum earning their loyalty and trust is key to our future its what has inspired us throughout our entire year history and it continues to inspire us today levatich said michael spaeth consumer marketing segment lead for harleydavidson pointed to harleys new  roadster and the dark custom models as examples of bikes that appeal to younger riders also he said in many ways millennial motorcyclists arent much different than previous generations of young riders its almost a little eerie how much young adults riding motorcycles today look like their fathers when they were that age the young guys are wearing the same clothing as their dads and they are riding a very similar style of motorcycle spaeth said some have said that millennials are less likely to buy things for status image or brand loyalty theyre more likely to make a purchase based on the value for their money according to a jd power survey with more than  respondents simplicity is in big and shiny bikes arent as popular with millennials said kirk topel owner of hals harleydavidson in new berlin they tend to like stuff thats more stripped down they like the simplicity of the design as opposed to how gaudy they can make something topel said increasingly harley dealerships are focused on attracting a younger crowd while at the same time keeping their older customers we like to do the stuff that makes everybody feel young said chaz hastings owner of milwaukee harleydavidson a dealership that has a tattoo parlor and wednesday night dodgeball tournaments samantha loftus  a millennial motorcyclist from milwaukee recently traded her yamaha cc bike for a  harleydavidson softail breakout loftus said there was a time when she thought of harleys as a grandpas bike but not anymore they have bikes that are sporty and fun i am excited about the whole experience of being a harley biker girl she said tyler youngbeck of brown deer says he will probably trade his yamaha warrior motorcycle for a harleydavidson because the harley would be better for touring youngbeck  has been a motorcyclist for five years one reason he wants a harley is that its a natural fit at many biker events in the area including parties at harley dealerships and the harleydavidson museum obviously riding is the best part but the social aspect is huge youngbeck said its a great atmosphere many consumerproduct companies have difficulty marketing to millennials because the younger audience is skeptical of advertising or doesnt follow media that run the ads we are less likely to be attracted to the contrived imagery said burklin nielsen a millennial motorcyclist from columbia county nielsen  says she gets most of her news and information online social and nontraditional media are probably the best ways to reach millennials like nielsen we check facebook and instagram constantly she said nielsen doesnt want to be stereotyped as a young adult with no responsibilities in reality she has a yearold daughter and a demanding career like other millennials she wants marketing material thats more akin to her lifestyle and interests including social causes we all have some belief that we feel strongly about mine is making sure that women can get out and ride said nielsen director of operations for stilettos on steel a womens motorcyclist group local influence millennials often say they prefer local events over traditional advertising or large gatherings to learn about new things what i really like to focus on are experiences i appreciate it when a company does more of a grassroots effort focused on building relationships said brenda martinez a yearold milwaukee motorcyclist and founder of litas in milwaukee a female riders group martinez owns a harleydavidson road king but said shes been attracted to royal enfield motorcycle events in milwaukee indiabased royal enfield established its north american headquarters in milwaukees third ward and hired former harleydavidson executive rod copes as north american division president royal enfield is the worlds oldest motorcycle company in continuous production the company known for its bikes that capture the essence of oldschool motorcycling — a throbbing engine simple electronics and a low price — is revered in india but is only now getting reestablished in the us it is back to the basics we are going back to what we believe motorcycling used to be when it was simple easy affordable and fun copes said royal enfield is focusing on local events in urban markets a few key national events and social media to reach millennials harleydavidson also sees the value in social media and events large and small in connecting with a younger audience we often say its their turf their terms and we fish where the fish are spaeth said harley was one of the partners in the mama tried motorcycle show earlier this year in milwaukee an event where more than  bikebuilders from across the nation displayed their work the show included an indoor flattrack race at the uwm panther arena we knew it was going to be successful given it was february but we had no idea that  people would show up many of which were young adults spaeth said events like the mama tried show rekindle the competitive spirit of the harley brand it helps us overcome that stereotype of old white guys on touring bikes and scenic mountaintops spaeth said he added forty years ago the boomers were getting into motorcycling for very similar reasons as the millennials its fun freedom

this releasekey rating driversthe rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and loss performance with cumulative net losses at  currently the collateral pool continues to perform within fitchs expectations based on the current structure and credit enhancement the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the current ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documentsrating sensitivitiesunanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiple levels for the transaction lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coveragethe notes exhibit a slight decline in loss coverage under a backended loss timing scenario however the probability of such a scenario is considered remote given seasoning growth and historical loss timing patternsin fitchs initial review of the transaction the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a x increase of fitchs base case loss expectation and moderate sensitivity to a x increase to date the transaction has exhibited solid performance with losses well within fitchs initial expectations in addition increasing credit enhancement levels has resulted in rising multiples as such a strong material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pools to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratingsuse of thirdparty due
