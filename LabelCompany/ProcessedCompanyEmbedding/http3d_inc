crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do”  steve jobs   blind courage august  august   httpd inc uncategorized adishno blind courage help i cant do it alone karen marie a couple weeks ago i was in a stall at the yacht club restroom when i heard an older man and woman entering the rest room  she was saying the doors are on your right as he tested the door to the stall i was in i said “almost there go one more door down” after hearing me he told his wife “someone is in here i’ll figure it out” and she closed the rest room door i heard him find the door and find the handicapped hand rail on the wall when he said “oh nice a handicap stall” when i came out of the stall i saw a bold yet wandering man standing in the center of the room working his way to the sink area so i offered an arm to guide him we washed our hands as i gave a narrative of soap and towel placement we introduced ourselves and conversed i learned he had been blind since birth i could feel the sense of excitement and adventure in his voice as he explained how he had arrived to this location while this was taking place karen had met his wife in the hall outside and was reassuring her that her husband is in good hands running into me as they heard our voices through the door i escorted him outside as we all joined in conversation  it turns out that they had arrived to the yacht club by kayak and since she didn’t bring shoes he gave her his socks from under his sandals as i think back on that day i think of the courage of a blind man on a kayak out on the water going to new places and boldly walking into the center of a rest room to find a sink they did not plan each step shoeless at the club but improvised and made it all work they didn’t expect help but welcomed it i have been working on this project for some time now recently i became aware that i needed to lower my shields and grow my internet social network image if i am to get people to follow me and my new ideas people hear ideas but follow leaders seven years completing my doctorate in leadership speaking there haha meeting a blind man and seeing his courage may have encouraged me to take chances following that weekend i started working on videos to explain the project and d technology in my designs i know i have a lot to learn about video camera settings staging relaxingand filming but i proudly published the first video in all of its imperfection maybe you will see more personality in my next video if i just hit record and post the results i am sure i will get better at it i have courage social networks – search engine optimization august  august   httpd inc uncategorized search engine optimization social media social network social networks flickr – social media interesting thing… i am trying to take a common phrase “walk the web” to search engines and make it mine so here comes the study on search engine optimization first on my web pages i had created as much supportive content as possible changed meta tags page titles etc… then i tried to register the name in as many social networks as possible because it appears that the social network user names are commonly listed in the search results and not to mention the ownership or partnerships tend to marry the search engine to the user databases of social networks sometimes the name “walk the web” is not available so i had to go with variations such as “walktheweb” and “walkthewebd” in addition i have adishno httpd and httpdinc as some of my social network names before this effort so now “walktheweb” “httpd inc” and “adishno” all have good responses in the search engines and each time i have something to post i post it in approximately  social media websites well me and a couple others assisting now some day i might have to have a contest to see who is following me on the most networks excluding my supportive wife karen of course so i have to keep working to get “walk the web” and “httpd” to show higher the good news is that if you find any one of my sites web or social network sites they tend to all be connected and point to the others with links maybe it is time to become a wiki writer it has to be easier than my dissertation my first youtube video – ish… august  august   httpd inc uncategorized d browsing d building websites adishno httpd pan and walk social media social network walk the web youtube i have been in videos and i am sure some are posted on the internet but today was the first time i tried to produce my own information video about my work  i bough a tripod set up my panasonic x zoom camera bought a light then set up the scene in my living room i then wrote some notes on a white board moved around the light and began testing the video scene first thing i knew was that i had to shut off the noisy air conditioning and fan to make the sound clear as you imagine on a day over  degrees the room temperature shot up as i attempted to record the message as sweat rolled in my eyes the th attempt was pretty good run through so i decided to call it a wrap and publish the video room for improvement of course but the first video is published one of many learning experiences well… better lighting would allow me to meet the screen brightness and then it wont look like i am in the dark… would be a good start also if i have a cable to copy the files off the video camera then i do not have to store it on sd ram which only let me set the video resolution to a lesser degree so… yes it will get better but overall i feel it was a good experience and a relief to get the first one done thanks for reading flier for la sierra university students image august  august   httpd inc uncategorized adishno computer science httpd la sierra university

wish passion plea for your help please walk the web work passion youtube in december  i had a sturdy job as webmaster making over  a year with san bernardino county and a second job as an adjunct professor at la sierra university my wife karen had a wellpaying position as a special education teacher at a school district we lived in a threebedroom twobath house in the inland empire we enjoyed weekends on a  foot sailboat we are a highly educated couple with a doctorate master degree and multiple teaching credentials so why change anything time for a midlife crisis no it didn’t quite happen that way my gradeschool years were possibly the last time i remember the same complacent feeling in my gut in a way coasting through life carefree and having the feeling of mastering my own existence of radio control planes boy scouts playing trumpet and school it was right before th grade started august  when i received my wakeup call well a phone call that shook my existence david mraz a playground friend and classmate had passed away from a brain aneurysm while swimming in a pool a real wakeup call i was  years old when i discovered my life was not a guarantee i think i have been seriously committed to everything i do ever since the rest of my childhood was the product of aerospace my dad bill worked for a number of aerospace and manufacturing companies when a contract ended people were laidoff and we moved to the next town state and job picture my mom bee in a fullsize dodge van with five kids and a german shepard dog while my dad drove across the country it is kind of a blur in my memory but i think i attended eight different schools over the next six years since then i have been incapable of coasting through life change became my norm accomplishment became my milestones ironically i am not competitive with others it is much worse i am competitive with myself and keep raising the bar mom maggie and her friend at the nursing home eugenia skip forward to november  mom maggie lost her battle with als to the end she fought for respect and dignity for everyone in the nursing home she believed in me and i admire her courage and voice for others i can’t let her down my family believes in me my wife believes in me i believe in me but it wasn’t until i felt the reminder of how fragile life is and no guarantee of tomorrow that i decided i could not wait another day i had to make a change now whatever amount of time i am given on this earth i have to use to make a difference i believe i can change the world for the better optimistically i believe that people will embrace it if people will embrace d browsing and our concept of d buildings and d communities we can make the money needed to help so many people with als homelessness mental illness addiction and nursing home quality of life these diseases and conditions affect everyone and the people closest to us  so i pictured where i want to be in a few years… staying at the county job wasn’t going to get it done up to now i had helped myself and now it is more important to me to help others i can use my talents to make the money and help others don’t get me wrong i want to make a lot of money to take care of me my family and my investors that put their faith in me by the time i asked my wife karen about making a change and giving this business a fair shot she could see in my eyes and heart that i no longer had a decision to make it had been made for me by the deepest part of me without hesitation she once again put her trust in me and said yes now at the end of march  we survived the change put our stakes in the ground in san diego staying on our sailboat opened an office and working fulltime for httpd inc and walkthewebcom d browsing some family and friend investors got us in the office but we need your help to get the word out please try d browsing at walkthewebcom and please contact me if you or someone you know would like a d building website they are great for

at our pinterest board httpswwwpinterestcomwalkthewebdwalkthewebdwalkthewebcom once again i am inspired august   httpd inc uncategorized admiration drive inspiration success five years of working on a d project for no pay while working fulltime sleepless nights working evenings and weekends and trying to find family time … following seven years of a doctorate dissertation project with the same dedicated passion and drive to completion insane some may think so but i asked myself why do i do it here is one good reason several years ago my wife karen and i were visiting my motherinlaw maggie and her husband ray we were sitting on their front porch in maine discussing movies when maggie mentioned seeing the movie “the social network” she knew i was a programmer and was always working on something i will always remember her words in a maine accent “aaron you’re smartah than that guy why don’t you come up with something bettah and make millions i know you can do it” little did she know i already started on an inspiring idea about d internet browsing maggie and karen telling stories since that day every time i get frustrated about slow development progress or the tunnel to completion getting longer i turn on the movie “the social network” take a couple deep breaths and get back to work i have seen it so many times that i rarely look at the screen and just know it is on in the room while i program so thank you mark zuckerberg and the cast of the movie you and maggie have inspired me now there is a new chapter in my admiration and inspiration from maggie at  years old has als and is fighting for her life recently karen and i were fortunate enough to be able to fly to maine and spend some time with her at the nursing home once again i am inspired by maggie at first glance i saw a lady in a power wheelchair fighting sclerosis in her legs seconds later the wheelchair fades from view as her warm smile and caring eyes overtake the room while we try to find out how she is doing all she wants to talk about is how we are doing by the end of the visit and all challenges considered i can say that she is doing well maggie shared with us dozens of old family photos dating back to the civil war as she named almost everyone in each photo she spends her time visiting other patients knows everyone by name including the regular visitors and even got reprimanded by the therapist for putting her wheelchair in power level  p and zooming past her door p is for outside only she has touched so many lives i understand how she will be remembered and loved by many people now i will push play on “the social network” and get back to work  and  year old children walk the web march   httpd inc uncategorized d browsing d building websites d community websites adishno gransdkids httpd pan and walk walk the web youtube this past weekend two of my grandkids came over for a visit as those of you that know me can guess i was working on my walk the web d browsing program the  yearold tommie jr came over to me and asked what i was doing so i handed him the mouse and within  seconds of instructions he was zooming all over the place i thought this would be a good way to share how easy it is to use so i asked tommie jr if he would teach everyone how to walk the web with a mouse like the amateur cameraman i am i cut off the video seconds too soon when tommie jr ended with “you are very welcome”  i couldn’t smile any bigger not to be outdone by his big brother  yearold christopher decided he wanted to give it a try we started with a video for keyboard and ended with a short video for touch screen and once again minutes after i completed taping christopher said “this is a fun game” tommie jr definitely had more experience with a mouse and christopher actually had problems with using the mouse his hands were too small to hold down the first mouse button and move the mouse with the trackball type mouse i use so he was doing a two hand attempt but when it came to the keyboard and touch screen he had no problem see for yourself it was a fun weekend thanks to tommie jr and christopher for showing us how easy it is to walk the web – d browsing d browsing not a game march  march   httpd inc uncategorized d browsing d building websites adishno change the world httpd pan and walk walk the web d browsing may look like a game  but don’t be fooled by appearance behind the scenes it is an html  website that brings together many of the latest programming techniques like partial page postbacks iframes canvas animation touch controls and css layers on traditional webpages you click a link and the browser goes blank the new page loads then you see the results in d browsing as you walk towards a d building it triggers the browser to go get more information – like clicking a link and opening a new webpage – the biggest difference is i keep the animation going continuously in the foreground as the information is then loaded and added to your current view all behind the scenes to see it in action go to httpsdwalkthewebcom as you walk towards the d building you will see all of the contents of the d building load walking is done by mouse keyboard or touch screen and works on desktops tablets and smart devices as long as they support html  which is most devices today d browsing loading and unloading d building content as you walk if you back away from the d building you will see the contents of the d building disappear this same thing happens to full d buildings as you walk down the street another feature in this demonstration is the ability to link to traditional web pages for example click on the billboard web pages can open in their own window or in an iframe in front of the d browsing view then try the video in the building – move around while it plays i have already tested many other web objects like forms text boxes check boxes file uploads buttons etc scrollbars sound and avatars with different chase camera views i will make them available soon finally this web server is the first of its kind hosting d building websites but it is designed to be hosted on other servers and interconnect d buildings into d communities all over
