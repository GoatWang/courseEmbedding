insurer rated at least a by standard  poors or rated at least a by moodys while no representation is made as to the insurers ability to meet its commitments this rating is due to the claimspaying ability of the insurers that provide coverage on the bonds in the trusts portfolio not on units of the trust for further details as to the terms and limitations of the insurance please consult a prospectus  a portion of your interest income may be subject to state or local taxes  due to the nature of municipal bonds there is a risk that a bond may be called before maturity potentially below

price of the units estimated longterm return eltr is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit there can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or eltr will be realized in the future and an investors units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost the eltr life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a trusts portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating estimated longterm return estimated annual income per unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit this amount will vary with changes in expenses interest rates and the maturity call or sale of bonds estimated daily rate of accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit bonds may be sold to meet redemptions to pay expenses and in other limited circumstances the sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit there can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future for fixedincome trusts sf indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bondsthe trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above important information about benchmarks about risk there is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective an investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them this trust is unmanaged accordingly you can lose money investing in this trust an investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due volatile interest rates early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds as interest rates rise bond prices fall the value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise given the historically low interest rate environment in the us risks associated with rising rates are heightened the negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future a bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded such action may adversely effect the value of the bonds in the trust and the value of the units the insurance provides coverage for the bonds held by the trust not on units of the trust invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any taxrelated investment decisions
