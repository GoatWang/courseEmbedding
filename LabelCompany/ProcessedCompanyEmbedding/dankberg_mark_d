fargo securities llc operator welcome to the viasats fy  first quarter earnings conference call your host for todays call is mark dankberg chairman and ceo you may proceed mr dankberg mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer okay thanks good afternoon everybody and thanks for joining our earnings conference call for our first fiscal quarter of  so im mark dankberg chairman and ceo and ive got with me here rick baldridge our president chief operating officer shawn duffy our chief financial officer keven lippert our general counsel and bruce dirks our treasurer and before we start keven will provide our safe harbor disclosure keven k lippert  executive vice president general counsel  secretary thanks mark as you know this discussion will contain forwardlooking statements this is a reminder that factors could cause actual results to differ materially additional information concerning these factors is contained in our sec filings including our most recent reports on form k and form q copies are available from the sec or from our website with that said back to you mark mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer okay so well be referring to slides that are available over the web and ill start with some highlights and a top level business overview and after that shawn will go through the consolidated and segment level financial results and in this quarter we thought wed spend a little time reviewing how we think about our rd investments in satellite broadband productivity and give some color about how that productivity manifests itself in our key broadband services businesses including an update on the rd status on viasat and viasat and then we will review our outlook and take questions so our first quarter was a pretty good start for the year overall revenue was up  yearoveryear new orders were up  and adjusted ebitda grew  all compared to the same quarter last year as we said last quarter we had significant growth in rd spending in our commercial network segment on viasat and success based commercial airborne supplemental type certificates or stcs as a reminder we are expensing the preflight payload engineering activities on the viasat satellite as an artifact of building the payloads internally absent that growth in rd expenses adjusted ebitda companywide would have grown  yearoveryear and op earnings even more than that our satellite services segment was especially strong arpu increased  yearoveryear due to a combination of packaging attractive higher bandwidth higherspeed service plans and increasing attachment rates on a growing portfolio of valueadded services subscriber count was relatively flat sat costs have been trending down on a per subscriber basis commercial aircraft inservice is growing and that led to a  yearoveryear increase in adjusted ebitda in the satellite services segment overall we continue to see strong demand for satellite services in target markets and later on ill go into more depth on our longerterm thinking on how we drive profitable growth there leveraging viasat and beyond our government segment also had very good results adjusted ebitda and operating earnings for the first quarter increased  yearoveryear on flat revenue though with a higher proportion of services than last year overall our government business seems well positioned for growth in revenues orders and earnings due to favorable outlooks in satellite mobility services tactical data links and some recently certified additions to our network security appliances portfolio government customers have been initially procuring satellite mobility terminals and then have been following that with the ongoing services contracts and as those are executed that helps provide visibility to our growth trajectory there the handheld link  radio thats shown on the slide is a good example of the way weve been growing our government business weve had end users support to develop a product that has strong market flow even without there being in a program of record for it a lot of our growth in the government segment including in mobility has come from creating unique and growing markets for products and services that arent served by the dod acquisitions were very pleased and excited by two very significant aeronautical mobile contracts with american airlines and the us government senior leadership fleet including air force one obviously those are really high profile customers and we believe winning those awards speaks volumes about the market recognition of the quality and economics of services on our satellite networks but even more importantly they are strong endorsements of our very simple yet highly differentiated approach to satellite broadband infrastructure so on that note shawn will give some more detail on the financial results and then ill come back and give some more color on that differentiated broadband infrastructure topic shawn lynn duffy  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks mark as mark just highlighted the satellite services and government systems segment drove the overall increase in adjusted ebitda more than offsetting declines in commercial networks specifically revenues were up  in satellite services and flat in government systems yet adjusted ebitda was up  and  respectively in each of these segments once again we reached record recurring adjusted ebitda of  million in satellite services with ebitda margin topping  which is a  basis point increase sequentially from fy  q and a  basis point increase yearoveryear and ill talk a little more about what drove those increases in a little bit in government systems our adjusted ebitda grew on flat revenue this reflects the growth of our higher margin service offerings as a scale  in this segment and higher product margin this service revenue expansion was multidimensional with strong growth from managed wifi services and military locations worldwide throughout viasat wireless service group plus growth in government mobile broadband service revenue we continue to make good strides in this part of our business with our recent announcement around future services for air force one and other elite aircraft for the us government in commercial networks quarterly revenues were down slightly from the prior year period with lower sales of ground infrastructure product offset by ramping modem sales to  our adjusted ebitda performance clearly reflects the strong ramping of our rd on our viasat satellite project we spoke about last quarter and inflight mobility stc activities which in total doubled yearoveryear and was the primary driver for our reduced segment profitability so overall we had a very good performance this quarter with continued growth in adjusted ebitda despite the ramp in the viasat program and stc activity associated with our commercial business looking to the next slide our income from operations was down slightly with higher depreciation and other noncash expenses offsetting our overall increase in adjusted ebitda and our gaap and nongaap net income follow the same relationship both down slightly from the prioryear period but again keeping in mind our rd trends i noted earlier each of these measures would have actually grown very sharply yearoveryear at levels of over  on a constant rd level basis regarding cash flow we more than tripled our cash flow from operations from the prioryear quarter with another quarter of solid ebitda performance plus strong collections on the large broadband infrastructure program winddowns we discussed earlier which reduced billed and unbilled accounts receivable balances by  million from the end of the last quarter and if you look to our trailing  month cash flow from operations you will see we generated  million of cash which was over  higher than last year q for the same period excluding the  million onetime loral settlement and more than doubled all of last years satellite capex investment so clearly our operations continue to fund a meaningful portion of our strategic growth activities our q capital expenditures were up  million compared to last year with the additional two viasat satellites under construction as well as higher quarterly expenditures on our viasat project and related ground segments as we approach the beginning of the launch window at the end of this year so we ended the quarter with  million outstanding on our revolver in  million drawn on our  million loan commitment from exim bank overall net leverage was  times trailing  month adjusted ebitda up modestly from  times in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and our liquidity remains very strong last quarter we spoke about our q revolving credit agreement upsides of  million to a total of  million this increase and the growing contributions from our operations got a significant lift in liquidity quarteroverquarter to  million with combined availability on the revolver in exim loan commitment and the  million of cash on balance sheet this next slide summarizes our key satellite service metrics as you can see in the chart on the top left adjusted ebitda increased pretty dramatically on a sequential basis up  from the previous quarter on an essentially flat subscriber count this earnings improvement was largely the result of another quarter of strong arpu growth up  per sub per month from q last year since we launched viastat we have grown arpu nearly every single quarter we have consistently grown our retail mix as well as tailoring plans and valueadded services that are filling the dimensions our customers value so in q we saw evidence of this again with more customers selecting valueadded services and more customer upgrades especially in transition to our liberty plans and remember a large majority of that arpu increase drops right to the bottom line and we think these trends will continue throughout fy  as we are ready for our viastat service launch next year another important notable is related to our stack per sub cost which this quarter reached the lowest point since our viastat service launch mostly as a result of lower advertising expense costs which are expense so with the additional growth from our commercial air business which i will hit on in a minute our segment adjusted ebitda grew sharply and reflected a yearoveryear revenue conversion of  on the inflight connectivity front we added another  commercial aircraft during the quarter ended the period with  commercial aircraft on our exede network we expect total count to continue to grow with our existing customers and that will be further expanded with our newest customer addition american airlines initially outfitting  new boeing  max aircraft we noted earlier that we are continuing to divest and obtaining supplemental type certificates as airline relationships expand along with the types of aircraft approved for exede service so yearoveryear we continue to grow our consumer broadband and inflight internet businesses and topline revenue and ebitda on an absolute and incremental margin basis these results would not have been possible on our legacy wildblue satellites with our limited capacity and higher capital cost per gigabit compared to the much more efficient viasat and our upcoming viasat and viasat platform which will take this efficiency to an allnew level so with that i will turn it back over to you mark mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer okay thanks shawn so this next slide makes a relatively simple point but its one thats really important to understanding our thinking about viasats businesses and how we build competitive advantage the charts are a reminder that broadband users keep demanding higher speeds and more bandwidth and that the revenues or arpus that service providers can earn from their users isnt growing as fast as the speeds and volumes so service providers with stronger competitive positions like cable companies competing mostly with dsl have been able to earn arpu gains but customers still continue to get better and better values in terms of megabits per second per subscription dollar or gigabytes of consumption per dollar in markets with greater competitive intensity like say cellular services arpus could actually decrease even while speeds and volumes are increasing so this race to deliver more output with the same or less capital input is essentially the definition of productivity and thats what were going to focus on the upchart is a service providers with infrastructure productivity advantages are going to do better than those with lower productivity so cable hybrid fiber coax networks improve speeds and volumes more efficiently than copper or telephone plan  does so theyre winning those competitions its harder when cable companies compete with fiber in mobile cellular the major providers are using industrystandard networks so competitive intensity is a bigger factor than relative productivity wed like to compete using assets like cable hybrid fiber coax versus telephone copper are much more productive in dimensions that matter to customers absolute productivity gains relative to demand are really good but relative productivity gains compared to the next best competitor also matter so even in times when usage demands might grow faster than productivity gains you can still do well if your productivity is better than competitors also one of the big advantages of the types of flexible satellites were building is that our bandwidth is portable we can move into those markets and applications where our productivity advantages are greatest productivity gains are valuable when per capita bandwidth consumption continues to grow we believe thats absolutely the case as more users spend more time consuming more video in more ways on better devices with higher resolution screens whether thats live streaming overthetop videoondemand embedded in social media or otherwise if we can improve our bandwidth productivity faster than others we can embrace bandwidth demand instead of fighting it and satellite broadband is very good at video so when we decided to enter the satellite services businesses with viastat our fundamental objective was to lead the industry in satellite network infrastructure productivity measured in useful gigabits per second of satellite bandwidth per million dollars of invested capital then what we want to do is use that viastat on bandwidth and bandwidth intensive applications to turn that productivity into profits we wanted to redefine the satellite services playing field to be technology driven where intent gains in productivity would yield significant competitive advantages in high markets and we believe we are demonstrating that in residential broadband commercial aeronautical mobile and government mobile broadband finally in cases where our infrastructure productivity is better than – to rest of our alternatives and that can be compared to dsl for instance or air to ground aeronautical networks we can take customers from those markets too so this chart shows relative productivity of different classes of satellite networks in two ways the righthand or orange scale measures gigabits per second of bandwidth capacity per million dollars of infrastructure investment or gigabits per megawatt thats the term weve used the left hand axis shows roughly how much a satellite operator would need to charge for that bandwidth in millions of dollars per gigabit per second per year to earn a  aftertax return based on a common set of assumptions on fill rates ebitda margins and other factors and be sure to note that the lefthand scale is logarithmic and that reflects the fact that there is orders of magnitude differences in productivity among these different classes of satellites the least productive in pure bandwidth are lband mobile satellites lband enables handheld phones and its relatively immune to weather but it is very expensive on a cost per bit productivity is improved from there for traditional c and kuband fixed satellite services global mobile kabands whats called high throughput satellites for kuband then there is existing  planned kaband high throughput satellites and finally the most productive is viastat and then the viastat and viastat series beyond you can do your own spreadsheets that the lower your bandwidth manufacturing costs are the lower the selling price you can offer and still make a predefine return on investment other factors being equal we also show a column for resellers whose primary business is selling connectivity to users like airlines or maritime ships or government platforms by packaging and selling bandwidth purchased from the satellite owners we show a range of prices that they would charge based on the type of bandwidth they are selling since their costs build on the prices that are charged by the satellite operators you would expect that their sell prices for each asset class would be higher than the infrastructures owners in order for them to earn a profit so the charts are directionally really representative of bandwidth pricing among these asset classes think of productivity as destiny for the satellite broadband services so using those same assumptions a viastat class satellite could deliver a comparable return at an order of magnitude to lower pricing which is just another way of expressing its order of magnitude productivity advantage and bandwidth manufacturing costs of course we recognize that going in risk profile for viasat was higher than that of a mature fixed satellite services or global mobile provider so we aimed at commensurately higher returns our current revenue run rate on viastat is multiples of the representative million dollars per gigabit per second per year value and thats directionally indicative of the returns that we are getting also note that even at that market price point viastat pricing is much better than or competitive with other asset classes so as far as we are aware we dont see any existing or planned satellite infrastructure projects with better productivity than viastat so we can use the productivity gains of vaistat and vaistat to provide even better services to our customers expand our addressable markets even more and still earn better margins you dont have to understand all this math to tell the difference between the inflight experience on a jetblue flight compared to an airtoground wifi service we believe we are seeing the effects of our productivity advantage in key markets and that we can scale them to create even more compelling competitive advantages and thats why we are investing at the pace that we are so in the next two slides we will show how those productivity improvements are manifested in the aero mobile and in the residential markets so this slide shows a relatively recent snapshot of our commercial aeronautical mobile service and satbeam maps of  kuband high throughput satellite and a global mobile kaband satellite network covering the continental united states our satbeam map is a composite of beams from viasat wildblue and anik f satellites each covering different parts of the us and we can choose from about  different available user beams in total the picture only shows the outlines of the larger beams around the edges of the united states but there are lots of other beams inside throughout the country so productivity is the ratio of useful output and gigabits divided by cost input in mega bucks and since the cost inorbit of all this classes of satellite systems is relatively comparable to each other and that means that orders of magnitude differences in productivity must be due to order of magnitude differences in the useful available bandwidth per satellite and that effect is further magnified because our first three satellites are wholly focused on the us and canada and the other systems are distributing their bandwidth over multiple geographic regions so if you look at the pictures closely youll see each of the other alternative systems only has about five or six beams in total available to serve the entire us market and each of those five or six beams has a total throughput capacity in the range of about  megabits to maybe a few hundred megabits depending on the satellite beam bandwidth when those bandwidths are delivered to an aeronautical mobile terminal in the upper picture each of the green arrows in the viasat network image is one of hundreds of aircraft inflight at that moment in time our network has so many beams and so much bandwidth per beam that we are currently able to deliver speeds of close to  mbps per plane for those planes with that level of demand at each point in their flight with viasat we will more than triple our effective network capacity and we will be able to support substantial growth in the residential network plus say in the range of  or more aircraft at service levels as good as or better than we deliver now but now imagine a network with only five or six spot beams trying to support even say  planes having to live with way less bandwidth per beam when those aircraft congregate in high demand markets up and down the east coast or at hub airports there will be beams with hundreds of aircraft in them even if an individual airplane could process  mbps the amount of bandwidth per beam divided by the number of airplanes per beam will often result in single digit megabits per second available per plane which is about the same amount thats currently delivered by the airtoground networks in that case putting  megabit per second modem on a plane only moves the bandwidth bottleneck from the plane itself to the satellite network infrastructure thats serving those planes and even that assumes that a single reseller can capture all the kuband highthroughput satellite bandwidth available in the us market finally its really important to note that the failure mode here is not that the bandwidth is so expensive its that theres just not enough of it and the result is the same thing thats created the opportunity for us today too much demand chasing too little bandwidth resulting in congestion slow service limited number of passengers per plane and limited online activities so right now competitive intensity in the aeronautical mobile market is really high but in the long run to the extent that passengers behave in the air as they do on the ground we believe the battle will be won based on bandwidth productivity while weve made great strides at improving the number of passengers using the internet and the amount of bandwidth available to each passenger were still in the early innings of helping the airlines capitalize on this onboard internet experience we can help the airlines embrace the trends driving internet bandwidth growth instead of fighting them we believe the airlines are beginning to see the effects of this in their own business as passengers express their preference for better and better connectivity and were confident of good growth going forward so this next slide is one weve shown in the past it was used by fcc chairman wheeler in september of  to illustrate the state of competition in the us residential broadband market as a function of four different speed tiers just like in the aero mobile market wed like to compete where we can have a productivity advantage relative to the competition and where competitive intensity is less in this case the bandwidth productivity advances of viasat and viasat are really important to separate ourselves from satellite competitors and to position ourselves better against less productive terrestrial networks so the blue segments at the bottom of each speed tier column show the fraction of the market that has no terrestrial alternative at that speed so if we can target the  megabits per second and  megabits per second portions of the market then we can be the only viable alternative in about  of those total markets compared to only about  to  at the  megabits per second and  megabits per second segments where we compete today furthermore at those speeds about  to  of the market has either zero or one choice of provider compared to only  to  of the market with only zero or one choice at the lower speeds so clearly with the right assets thats a better place to play at higher speeds well need to allocate more bandwidth per subscriber but arpus will be higher competitive intensity will be lower and our bandwidth flexibility and portability will help us find those geographic markets with the best distribution channels subscriber acquisition costs and retention rates we do expect that terrestrial speeds will increase and that more choices will be available in more geographic markets so we also expect that subscribers will continue to migrate upward in speed to  megabits per second and higher as long as we can improve our productivity faster relative to terrestrial alternatives in specific geographic areas weve got attractive growth and earnings potential thats pretty much the opposite of conventional wisdom that satellite services are condemned to play at the lowend of the markets at price points associated with the least attractive mass market terrestrial alternatives so since we are investing a lot in rd and capital we figured it would be good to give an update on progress in those areas so viastat satellite construction and integration is essentially complete and the spacecraft is in the middle of environmental stress screening all functional performance testing has been completed and the satellite meets its performance objectives weve also invested a lot in the new ground network system needed to achieve the broad geographic coverage and bandwidth flexibility that we expect will further improve the value and productivity of the network compared to alternatives and thats also meeting its objectives some of our rd investments in ground gateway technology are reducing system capital costs so total capital investment is at the lowend of the range we anticipated at the start that means our productivity improvement target of double viastat looks really good there is upside potential in capacity so there is a good opportunity to do meaningfully better than our initial objective just as we do with viastat the upper right image shows one of our radar installations weve been investing in stcs for retrofits on narrow bodies such as  and  we are beginning to serve in europe with el al overall interest from both domestic and international airlines has been really good and their interest has led to good progress on factory retrofit and line fit options with both major airframe companies and with viastat launch nearing and viastat under construction were seeing new and significant activity for installations on call wide bodies too the lower right picture is our new facility in tempe arizona where we are building the viasat payloads it includes our high bay clean room for final assembly and integration with the payloads which will be made to the high power boeing platforms so at this point we are building preflight engineering units and performing modules subassembly and payload system tests and characterizations its still early but so far things are on track for  first launch and performance is consistent with our objectives the bottom left shows government and commercial versions of our new  gigabit per second network infrastructure encryptor appliance that generation is aimed at cloud and data center applications and its the first layer  device to market at that speed so last year we invested in development certification of new infrastructure in edge devices and were seeing really good market interest in those products okay so finally ill give some insight into factors that should drive our financial results going forward given the upcoming launch of viasat and the substantial lift we expect that that can create across our businesses we will consider each segment in a pre and post viasat environment for satellite services it looks like current trends can continue prior to the viasat launch and inservice states we aim to continue to grow arpu through higher value plans and additional valueadded services sat cost on a per sat basis have been trending down and churn is roughly steady well continue to add newer aircraft and wed expect that trends driving greater passenger engagement and bandwidth would continue were working with existing and new airline partners to help them better monetize our bestinclass passenger experience and also to use connectivity to help produce higher fee cost inflight entertainment so with viasat in service we expect a high speed plans without hard bandwidth caps can enable continued growth in arpu well be targeting faster subscriber growth probably with per subscriber sat costs growing to more historical level and aggregate sat expenses scaling with subscriber growth and well also have some migration from existing plans we expect churn to remain steady or possibly improve from current levels with the new plan we also may see a higher installation rate for new aircraft once viasat is in service and increased service availability due to the greater geographic coverage and viasta can also benefit our business sat services as we migrate more of those from kuband to ka in our commercial segment there is opportunities for modest revenue growth especially related to mobile terminal equipment as we said last quarter we plan on continued elevated rd expenses for viasat preflight engineering and aircraft stcs especially post viasta we see increasing opportunities for revenue growth especially in the mobile terminals and rd expenses may flatten for our government segment were seeing longterm trends towards growth in both products and service revenues that with the growing proportion of service revenues we believe those trends would continue and given the lumpy nature of new orders could have opportunities for backlog expansion were also in the early stages of new product cycles on smaller link  tactical data links terminals and nextgeneration network security appliances we believe viasat entering into service lifts our prospects for growth in the government segment in terms of revenue earnings and new orders so overall were really focused on what we believe is a very compelling longerterm story i hope weve shown that starting with viasat going into service and accelerating as viasat comes into the picture that were building a sustainable competitive advantage in terms of asset productivity that greatly expands the opportunities for us both in our current businesses and a much larger addressable market youll hear us talk more in the future about opportunities were just now beginning to get into in the areas like maritime and global wifi access that have exciting potential growth – to deliver the growth that our ground breaking technology can enable and thats why were investing at the rate we are and well look forward to sharing more as those elements mature so thats it for our prepared remarks and well be happy to take questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from the line of rich valera from needham  company your line is now open richard valera  needham  co llc thank you i appreciate the color on the preand post viasat with the different businesses mark just wondering if you thought that migration might become a factor again post launch of viasat as they were when you initially launched viasat mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer yes we do we listed that as one of the factors i think that its going to be much less of a factor than it was with viasat for the main reason that the difference in the satellite productivity is narrower than it was between wildblue and in viasat so they were looking at like a x x increase in productivity and this is more or like double or maybe a little better than that so there will be some but we think it ought to be more manageable based on the way we defined the services richard valera  needham  co llc okay is there any way we could think about that i think you peaked at like k a year in the first year of that transition so sort of a significant factor less than that is how we should think about it when we think about the first year mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer i think the way id think about it is one of the ways and we talked about this a couple of quarters ago is think about it as we improve the productivity we can use some of that bandwidth gain to improve the surface as one of the big factor and then another part to improve our margins so think of it as if we gave it all to our customers wed have half the customers per unit bandwidth if we kept it off ourselves we would have double the customers in total per satellite and well be in between so what it really will mean is that the yield on viastat will go down a little bit but will grow subscribers on viastat at a faster rate and because a lot of the terminals are i think the terminals are capable of – a lot of the terminals are capable of the services that we offer viastat we wont have the sat costs associated with the migrations that we did before so thats a big benefit for us so when we model migrations think of its a little more sort of normalizing productivity than it is stack expenses as it was last time there will still be stack expenses associated with it but those will be moderated richard valera  needham  co llc got it mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer does that make sense richard valera  needham  co llc yeah that does just wanted to get your sense on how your message is resonating in the market you presented a pretty compelling picture there of the relative bandwidthcost benefit that you have versus pretty much anything else out there in the market and it seems like even in terms of the worstcase viastat you are at least x better than pretty much anything else out there and then you can close up to kind of x so when you present this to your prospective inflight connectivity customers how is this resonating or are they sort of getting it and what would be the pushback they would have i mean it seems if theyre looking at that it would be kind of a nobrainer to go with the guys to go with the guy with sort x sort of bandwidth cost advantage but what are some of the things you are sort of hearing and how is that resonating in the marketplace mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer so one thing – i mean one thing that anybody can observe is just look at the language that is now around whats going on in the airplanes right i mean people are always talking about oh we need  megabits per second per airplane right or  megabits per second per airplane so people are one is you are seeing an acknowledgment that the demand for bandwidth is going to be a lot higher than it was so thats a good thing i think another thing that youre seeing is more people talking about the things that drive bandwidth consumption which is video streaming as an example right that you can see  we can do video streaming or you dont need video streaming look at our ife who needs netflix i think one is that youre seeing more and more conversations around this another thing that i think is actually indicative of whats going on in the market is that more and more satellite operators or resellers are talking about capacity in satellite and gigabits one of the things that we try to emphasize in our productivity chart is that youre going to see look when people know that gigabits are important now i think theyre kind of inflating the gigabits rankings of satellites compared to what they were talking about originally one of the really good ways for people to reconcile that is to look at illuminated gigahertz of spectrum and then to think about youre not going to get  bits second per hertz or  bits per second per hertz on to an airplane with a small amount of illuminated gigahertz so whats happening is i think that the playing field is toping to the point that we have made i think that the competitors are trying to frame their offers more in the ways that weve framed ours i think that id say industry consultants and customers are still wrestling with all the technical details that go into making that chart and people are i think still a little bit confused about it but i would say when we talk to airlines they are more and more interested and concerned with how can their providers ensure that they will deliver the amounts of bandwidth that they say they well much more focused around that and thats why i think youre seeing people put out one airplane or two airplanes and say look hey we can stream netflix or we can get  megabits but i think the real issue is what happens when you have hundreds or thousand airplanes in a small number of beams i think people are still little bit confused about that and so thats our current campaign the flipside of that is especially when weve gotten some of the customers that we have there are number of airlines – especially the longhaul international ones that are just saying we just want the best one and right now i think theres a lot more acknowledgment that thats us and so thats one of the reasons that weve been so busy in the stc space and then working with air framers on the widebody offer line fit and factory retrofits richard valera  needham  co llc got it mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer i mean you are covering this space too so i think you can weigh yourself on  richard valera  needham  co llc fair enough i appreciate that color that was helpful mark thank you mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer thanks rich operator and our next question comes from line of andrew degasperi from macquarie your line is now open andrew degasperi  macquarie capital usa inc thanks macquarie first question can you maybe clarify for us what the fcc spectrum frontiers order impact is to viasat or viasat potentially in the  gigahertz band mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer yeah we obviously follow that we paid a lot of attention to that we have been probably the leading proponent of spectrum sharing in the satellite industry i think that put us in kind of a leadership position and – in the discussions around that and also weve been probably ahead of the curve in taking advantage of spectrum sharing in that  gigahertz band so at the end i think that the statements that the fcc made around what their intentions were are good for g and for the satellite industry they acknowledged the issues around grandfathering the teleport gateways for existing satellite systems including for viasat and viasat and there are provisions for many thousands of new gateways throughout the us for viasat and beyond using that  gigahertz spectrum band the fcc also acknowledged that there was need for further study to deal with both the local interference levels associated with those gateways and the aggregate interference that may arise from g use of the  gigahertz band on the spacecraft itself so i think we believe that there is a framework in place for a good outcome theres still a lot of work to be done overall we think the outcome is good and consistent with our plans andrew degasperi  macquarie capital usa inc great and if you could just remind us what the backlog is currently on your commercial aircraft ive seen that you keep adding planes but where you essentially adding these from are they existing customers that they are just giving you more aircraft or are there new fleets coming online can you maybe just comment on that mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer yeah we have – we are basically primarily adding aircraft from the fleets that we currently have so that is adding aircraft for jetblue – for instance jetblue completed its regional expansion jetblue has also talked about adding planes to its fleet weve been adding to the united fleet virgin america and el al and then we have the single biggest lump of backlog is the american airlines  max award andrew degasperi  macquarie capital usa inc if we think about the rest of the year till viasat goes up in  american thats when it will hit but as far as your existing customers how should we be thinking about net additions mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer id say – maybe not quite at the levels that weve been at in the last quarter probably going down a little bit from that based on what the current situation is that could change but i would say for the next couple of quarters or so id think about it in those terms andrew degasperi  macquarie capital usa inc got it and last question for me retail business based on dishnet numbers it seems that your retail business more than made up for the weakness in wholesale can you maybe tell us what youre doing differently there mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer i dont think – i think were doing the things that weve described over the last year or so i think weve got – we are very happy with our retail distribution network i think weve expanded that i think that the plans that were offering are good they are more attractive i think were just grinding it out i think were getting operationally pretty good and i think those are all good factors pending the launch of viasat andrew degasperi  macquarie capital usa inc got it thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of mike crawford from b riley your line is now open mike crawford  b riley  co llc thank you can you give an update on the status of your jvs that youre forming with eutelsat mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer okay yeah i think last – was it last – week before they had their earnings conference call and that was one of the topics there and i think our view of it is just like theirs that weve got good top level agreement between us theres a pretty fair amount of detail to go through to reach closure on the agreements we dont see anything thats jumping out as threatening that but there is work to do i think they said and weve kind of agreed that probably this year is a reasonable target for completing it also one thing i would like to point out which is good in the meantime is that were cooperating with them on helping to think about the kasat services and one point we mentioned is that we now have our first joint european aircraft on kasat with el al so thats exciting and i think its good progress mike crawford  b riley  co llc just one more question in that regard is that eutelsat sold its majority stake in this maritime service provider so does that mean that you will be able to service the maritime market with eutelsat with one of the jvs mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer so the mobility services is definitely one of the targets in the jv so that would be through kasat and through the nextgeneration satellite and i think were a really good mobility partner i think we would have to talk – you would have to ask eutelsat what their overall plans are in serving that market but i dont think thats – im not sure id read too much into that one particular issue mike crawford  b riley  co llc okay and if i could just turn back to this productivity issue mark one thing you stated in this call i believe you said viasat will more than triple effective network capacity for i guess airborne mobility mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer yeah if you think of viasat having unit capacity of one and viasat has double that capacity then between the two of them that makes three and thats – that triple the total capacity mike crawford  b riley  co llc i thought you were referencing the more flexible beam architecture mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer no i dont want to be ambiguous about that basically what weve talked about is double the throughput so that means weve got a lot more illuminated gigahertz on viastat then on viastat weve gone through this in the past the infrastructure cost is like  to  higher so the total throughput must be more than double in order to get double the bandwidth economics and we have not counted flexibility as part of that it is just raw bandwidth now we think that flexibility and portability is going to increase the yield on the satellite but we havent factored that into that number richard a baldridge  president  chief operating officer the other thing is this is rick with the increased coverage i think they will have more time of the aircraft that are flying more time within the coverage area and so thats going to be a factor as well mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer  i think one of the things i said also is we think theres upside to our current numbers so we will report on that as some of the elements of that fall into place but right now were sort of we think we are sort of doing well compared to what our original target was because the capacity numbers are holding and the capital costs are at the low end of the range mike crawford  b riley  co llc thank you and then just to try to be absolutely clear on this so with the kuband satellite that one  has a wide beam and maybe only five beams over north america so what in theory could you do with things like antennas and modems and compression software to improve the volume of bits that you can deliver to one aircraft and then to hundreds of aircrafts like to use your example up and down the east coast mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer what you look at is illuminated you look at illuminated gigahertz and there was a time maybe they are not advertising it so much but there is a time when you can look on the web and you can find the illuminated gigahertz for each of the satellites and then you divide that among the beams and its not necessarily uniformly allocated among the beams but it gives you a sense of order magnitude of the amount of gigahertz that you have to work with in each of these beams and then from there what you do is you just turn that into how many bits per second per hertz you can get and thats a function of the link budget the antenna on an airplane is a factor but its basically its a twoway link budget so you have to look at you can improve with the bigger antenna you can improve the downlink portion of the link budget a little bit but thats not the total link budget you have to put that in context of the total link budget and its   increase in capacity relative to a smaller antenna so you can make bigger and bigger antennas and you can get a little bit more gain and a little bit more throughput but youre not going to go from  bits per second or  bits per second to  bits per second you might go from  bits per second or  bits per second or  bits per second or  bits per second or something along those range thats what you get the rest of the stuff things like compression those are pretty much available to those people we think we have really good compression technology a big part of that has to do with the way content is distributed by media companies so there is domestic compression that are driven by end to end encryption that are available to any isp so our point is theres not a lot of maneuvering room and it is sort of like we say which is like bandwidth productivity is kind of the destiny of these systems mike crawford  b riley  co llc okay thank you and then just switching to commercial networks you are talking about some opportunities to grow even though the types of gateways and architectures you are building and designing for yourself are different from what others seem to be considering unless thats changing so is this more of a modem type opportunity with nbn and potentially others or what is it specifically that you are targeting for potential growth in commercial networks given the way that your business has shifted mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer yes one of the decision that we had to make was whether we wanted to build network infrastructure for sort of gardenvariety high throughput satellites or whether we wanted to invest in those things that would drive productivity and what weve chosen to do is to invest in things that would drive productivity i think if we were only in the business of building and selling products that would be a tough decision but when we are in the business of selling services and we have these enormous productivity gains that justifies the rd investments that makes it an easy choice so what were doing is were really building ground infrastructure for satellite networks that are using our unique technologies and we havent seen any other operators really go for those so nbn was a good opportunity for us because they used basically viasat technology i mean what they want to is the viasat in their market and ksat was the same way so those are good fits for us but were not investing in that type of infrastructure anymore so we dont really model selling infrastructure going forward as a standalone product what we are seeing though more and more are outside of satellite operators saying well i think about this productivity issue we would like to be on your side and so we are seeing more opportunities for things where in specific regions operators would partner with us building on our network infrastructure eutelsat and ksat i mean thats a really good example of that so some of that might lead to network and infrastructure sales like for instance what we did with xci on viasat we have other opportunities for infrastructure product sales but they are more based on our own sub satellites and on partnerships mike crawford  b riley  co llc okay and thank you and then final question relates to government systems where you have stt in this bats terminal that represents potentially quite large program that as you mentioned came in not through normal program or record are there other opportunities like that like say what that information assurance products that youre targeting right now mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer yes definitely more and more were seeing sort of a disconnect between the procurement system and what users want and so thats what were aiming for especially things that are adjacent to or variances stuff we already do so a great example of that is the stt terminal which started out as basically as a rd program with us with some customer support but then turned into the program of record for apache helicopters and the others quite a big market for helicopters both domestically and internationally and other small form factors for that our handheld really good sign recently it was given radio designators by dod which is indicative of its desire to turn that into essentially a new program of record for that type of application and we see more of those not only in the tactical data links and security space but also in the satellite space so that – i think thats a big part of why our revenues are still growing and were sort of diverging from some of the other big defense aerospace command and control communications companies mike crawford  b riley  co llc okay thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of  mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer okay one more operator and our next question comes from the line of andrew spinola from wells fargo your line is now open andrew c spinola  wells fargo securities llc thanks mark i wanted to ask you about on slide  and im looking at the coverage maps of viasat versus your competitors the one thing thats clear to me is that youve obviously concentrated your capacity with viasat over the united states while your competitors have opted for a lot more coverage and im wondering as you opt for a lot more coverage with viasat and viasat why wont you suffer the same or similar productivity declines that your competitors have with the existing satellites or will you mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer yep so thats a really good question so there is really two factors one is the total illuminated gigahertz that we will have with our satellite is much much larger than the total illuminated gigahertz for those other ones so if you look if you go through and do some research you will see that the total illuminated gigahertz with those three others ranges from  gigahertz or  gigahertz to maybe  gigahertz or  gigahertz viasat was  and viasat is quite a bit more than that and viasat is a way more than that so one is the illuminated gigahertz and thats really the factor that we have focused on and by illuminated gigahertz what i mean is take the bandwidth per beam multiply that by the number of beams and you will get a total – it called total illuminated gigahertz so number one is thats a really important metric of total productivity over the entire footprint but the other really big factor is the one that mike crawford was sort of bringing up which is this flexibility and so one thing that would be nice with the satellite and this is what we do with viasat is you could say hey well the us market in fact wifi is way bigger than all the rest of those coverage areas how that if we move all of those illuminated gigahertz into the us market that would be really good if thats where the demand is and none of those other satellites have the ability to do that thats a really important thing that we are doing on viasat where we have a very big footprint we cover latin america down to south america we cover the atlantic ocean we cover the caribbean but if we wanted to we could bring all that bandwidth back into the us so that doesnt increase the illuminated gigahertz but it makes it a lot more useful when different market develop at different rates so we think those are the two really big advantages that we have andrew c spinola  wells fargo securities llc got it and i just wanted to ask one quick followup you mentioned the maritime market is something that might be interesting to you longerterm and its kind of a unique market given the predominance of lband and the strength of one competitor and im just wondering it seems like that viasat sort of likes to target areas that can be disruptive and have markets that have characteristics that would lend themselves towards being disrupted and just wondering if you have a similar thought process about the maritime market and if thats one of the reasons why you think thats an opportunity mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer yep exactly so the thing thats really interesting about the maritime market now is lots and lots of ships tens of thousands of ships in total but not very much bandwidth is used all right so the bandwidth per ship is not that high and essentially what a lot of those ships are paying for is the ability to be connected if they need to be but theyre not really using a lot of bandwidth because theres not a lot of bandwidth to be had at the other extreme of the market there is a small number of ships with very very large bandwidth demands and for those it doesnt mean that theyd have to cancel their lband subscription they could still use that for safety and emergency communications but they have very high bandwidth needs because they have a lot of passengers or they have a big crew or they have an exploration mission that requires collection of enormous amounts of data so those are the ends of the market that were going after a small number of ships with very large bandwidth requirements because thats where we think most of the money is and thats what were going to target andrew c spinola  wells fargo securities llc got it thank you mark d dankberg  chairman  chief executive officer okay so i think that cover – my voice is gone – that covers a lot of the questions so i think that will be it for this afternoon thanks a lot everybody for joining our call look forward to talking to
