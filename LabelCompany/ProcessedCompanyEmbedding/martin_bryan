water starts to sink and surface water is pulled in to replace the water that sank the ocean sentinel is used to develop wave energy technology measure and understand the waves as an energy resource and study the energy outputthese will cost around  million us dollars the oyster system uses a simple onshore base and the system is capable of operating at small depths making it more accurate than far out at sea systems each system is capable of providing energy for  homesthese systems are fairly new so there is not a set price as of right now some current research and methods of harnessing wave and tidal power include using push plates the ocean sentinel and using the oyster system how these push plates work are they are connected with a chain the water flow pushes plate a and when plate a reaches point x plate b that is also connected with the same chain happens to reach point y at point y the kinetic energy of the water flow works upon plate b to push it forward and with the placement of size and location appropriate gears they can spin the shaft of a generator to produce clean energythere was no set price because the company is still in a prototype stage in australia
