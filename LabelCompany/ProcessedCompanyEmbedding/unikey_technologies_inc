recently starred on the fourth season of the abc television show “shark tank” in may walking away with a  deal for his company which manufactures keyless entry systems for smartphones enlarge phil dumas president and founder unikey technologies increcently starred on the fourth… more as a graduate from the university of central florida with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering dumas first started developing phonecontrolled locks while working on his senior design project in college which involved an access system for a car door fresh out of college dumas worked for biometric access control company sequiam corp after working his way up to vice president of product development dumas left the company and spent a few years in the private equity field before founding unikey technologies inc continuing to pursue an easytouse access system but using different technology seeking exposure for his new company dumas submitted applications for his unikey product to be featured on “shark tank” a television show where wealthy entrepreneurs seek out new products to finance after being invited on the show dumas impressed the sharks with the cuttingedge unikey lock system during the season finale which aired on may  dumas chose to accept a joint deal between kevin o’leary and mark cuban who offered  for  percent of the company and two seats on the board of directors currently dumas is enjoying the publicity his company has gained from appearing on the show and is working to get the product to market heres what he had to say about the show how did you come to be on “shark tank unikey was in a position where we needed some publicity and it was actually my father who pushed me to apply and i just sent a ton of emails to them when somebody actually read the email they called me and we talked about the next steps in the process to be on the show what were your thoughts on having your product featured on “shark tank it’s been the best thing that’s ever happened to our company the publicity we’re still sifting through the potential sales are great and the potential partnerships are even greater with other access control companies wanting to work with us now all the way up to giant companies that would never give a company of our size the time of day are now calling us and wanting to meet with us what do you think of shows like “shark tank” promoting products and helping entrepreneurs i think its tv first and foremost and people need to remember that because there are companies that go on there for entertainment value i don’t know if they’ll admit it but it’s quite obvious i do think there are some real companies on there and i think it does help them get some exposure which is great for them you received offers from each shark why did you pass on robert herjavec’s proposed  million for  percent equity to be honest it was nice to get offered  million but it was not a reasonable deal it wasn’t even something that i considered i appreciate that someone would make an offer like that but it wasn’t a fair offer why did you decide to go with mark cuban and kevin o’leary’s  offer for  percent equity just the potential relationships i felt the company could hold a higher evaluation but the potential partnerships weighed in on the decision for sure what was going through your head during the negotiations how did you keep cool i was very aware that i had five people interested in the deal so at the very end there i went a little bit quick to try to make a decision and close the deal because if you hesitate and counter too much somebody is gonna get offended and jump out on you and i just didn’t want to hear it what’s the next step now that you received an offer from the company standpoint it’s just to get the product to market is our main focus right now which we’re working on and pursuing industries technology suggested reading featured jobs maitland fl national sales director activengage inc auburn ca senior
