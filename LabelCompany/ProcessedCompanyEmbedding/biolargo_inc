the beginning kenneth reay code the ‘inventor’ entrusted with the biolargo technology began this journey of ours over  years ago when his father had a severe stroke and was left severely impaired bed ridden or wheel chair confined and in need of longterm convalescent care out of concern for his father’s great risk of secondary infection ken set out to find a way to extend his father’s life expectancy and improve his quality of life by reducing his risk of contracting disease and by reducing compounding risks of secondary infections that are so common in longterm care facilities through his scientific trials of blending low dose inorganic chemical compounds and absorbent materials he made what may just be called a “genuine discovery” when the biolargo technology is incorporated into products many of which are already widely known and in use those products become an effective tool in stopping the transmission of life threatening disease “all we had to do was figure out how to apply these naturally occurring compounds to products so they could do what they were created to do and put them to use out in the field where disease is most prevalent” – kenneth reay code kenneth reay code performs quality assurance the company has expanded the original technology to now include long list product designs and delivery systems keeping the original mission intact to “make life better” the company has a broad base of science and technology to impact our water – air – food – plants – animals – people making them clean safe  healthy biolargo technology disclaimer the products

advisers recently published an article focused on clyra medical technologies exciting presentation at the peter sheehan wound healing science  industry conference in san juan puerto rico   a year and a half ago biolargo inc otc blgo announced that its clyra medical division secured financing to advance its novel wound care products  steve harrison president of clyra medical technologies then commented we believe this financing will provide the capital needed to help clyra secure the regulatory approvals and launch what we believe will become a game changer for the advanced wound care industry this is a fastgrowing  to  billion market in which we believe we will be able to offer better and more costeffective solutions” last month clyra medical presented their breakthrough products at the th annual peter sheehan wound healing science  industry conference in puerto rico that was attended by leading wound care clinicians and researchers we had a chance to speak with mr harrison who reported “we are highly encouraged by the overwhelming positive response from the clinical wound care experts attending the conference  the data from the fda presubmission testing generated a great deal of enthusiasm among the leading clinicians and researchers at the conference  the required presubmission studies were conducted by nelson labs an independent third party that is recognized as one of the leaders in laboratory testing for fda submissions” the presentation at the conference highlighted clyra’s advantages over existing wound care products clyra’s hydrogel wound dressings and wound wash are highly effective and have no known antimicrobial resistance glp lab studies demonstrated sustained release and continued antimicrobial effectiveness against major organisms effective against biofilm in laboratory controlled in vivo pig studies has shown effectiveness against mature biofilm with better results than certain prescription antimicrobial solutions non cytotoxic nonsensitizing and safe to human cells can easily integrate clyra technologies into existing products and new ones in the pipeline including regenerative tissue   dr brock liden dpm a wound care expert with an extensive wound and limb salvage practice in ohio presented the latest clyra data to the conference he commented “when i was introduced to the clyra technology i was very interested to learn more this is a complex that has been shown to impact bacteria and show sustained activity yet be safe to cells and the wound healing process it may have clinical application to be used with cellular tissue products stem cells and growth factors with no harm to the modality this is a significant breakthrough in the wound space with further clinical research we may even have a modality to impact established biofilms while doing no harm to the host or the healing modalities being utilized  as i learn more about clyra’s technology i feel that it has the potential to have a significant impact in wound care as well as potential in other areas of medicine” on the flip side of their enthusiasm is that clyra is keenly aware of the stiff competition they will face in the wound care industry  one established competitor offering a broad line of wound care products is smith  nephew nyse snn  another is osiris therapeutics nasdaq osir that offers regenerative medicine products for difficult to treat acute and chronic wounds clyra has retained emergo a global firm specializing in medical device regulatory consulting to prepare its fda filings and reports they are on track for filing in the very near future with the relatively short turnaround times for k submissions and the ongoing need for better wound care products it is possible that clyra’s powerful gentle and longlasting products may soon find themselves entering the rewarding stage of commercialization  corrected version  legal disclaimer except for the historical information presented herein matters

agreements with three top waste industry leaders denver co  accesswire  june    with population density and urbanization increasing around the world the need for costeffective industrial odor control has become an even greater priority and the problem has largely gone unsolved by the traditional suppliers historically the available solutions have not satisfied users because most products only mask foul odors with heavy fragrances rather than eliminating the odors leading waste handling companies have been struggling with industrial odors for decades believing there was no costeffective solution that truly works the only true solution is a product that will mitigate wasterelated odors by actually eliminating the odorcausing compounds and doing so without breaking the bank until now no such product has been on the market recently a new product is gaining traction among leading waste handling companies that may change the paradigm cupridyne® clean industrial odor eliminator made by odornomore inc a subsidiary of biolargo inc blgo the company claims cupridyne clean actually works by eliminating odors rather than masking them with fragrances the product has been proven effective against the nasty odors created at all types of facilities that handle and process our trash  from the trash trucks that haul it to the transfer stations that sort it and at the landfills composting centers and recycling operations where it ends up from a scientific perspective cupridyne clean oxidizes odors such as hydrogen sulfide ammonia mercaptans fatty acids sulfur compounds and vocs volatile organic compounds it can even be delivered fragrancefree since it does not rely on any sort of masking strategy in the past few weeks biolargos subsidiary odornomore has signed what are known as national purchasing or national supply agreements with three leading us waste handling companies an interesting development given that they started selling the product a year ago and had since not reported major advances in sales in an audio interview with snnlive posted on the biolargo blog a few weeks ago biolargos president described the signing of these national agreements as breaking a barrier to entry according to their sec filings the agreements do not guarantee any volume of sales but they do put the company in the system of a large company as an approved vendor allowing the local facilities to easily order product and get their account serviced without having to secure payment or deal with new contracts and according to calvert the agreements allow them to approach a facility explain the product has been reviewed and approved by corporate and been evaluated for safety and that other company facilities are using it with success doing business with a larger company can have its challenges and corporate approval in agreements like these would be a major gateway to sales in any industry calvert believes sales will continue to grow and have the potential to increase significantly calling  a breakthrough year in addition to the news about these national agreements biolargo has also recently reported additional scientific breakthroughs in its clean water treatment technology the aos advanced oxidation system and that the company is on the verge of filing for an fda approval for its advanced wound care products through its subsidiary clyra medical technologies in any event the market should respond positively as sales figures climb in biolargos april   trade release to industry at wasteexpo  it disclosed the first national agreement with waste connections inc a multibillion dollar company operating in  states it announced a second national agreement in an interview on may  and then later identified the customer as waste industries usa another top  us company at biolargos annual stockholder meeting on june th they announced a third arrangement with another top  company but refused to disclose its identity in a recent letter to biolargo stockholders calvert reported we are now servicing  of the top  companies in the waste handling industry and confirmed that sales are growing while the waste handling industry is certainly a prolific consumer of industrial odor control products the need for such products extends into other large industries such as wastewater treatment livestock and poultry production food processing composting and more in fact across these industries there are over one million industrial facilities with serious and chronic odor control challenges us industries that generate industrial odors approximate  us operations solid waste facilities   waste to energy plants   cattle and calf operations   poultry farms   meat  poultry slaughtering plants   hog farms   publicly operated wastewater plants   total us industrial facilities   regardless of how large the market need is the big question is how much of this large market can be won by a disruptive new product categorically superior to competitors biolargo has reported in its market analyses that the facilities they target could use anywhere from  to  per month in odor control products although weather and temperature may have an impact on the need to control odor at any one facility hypothetically if cupridyne clean captured  of the market in the solid waste facilities business alone at a gross revenue per month of  that would equate to approximately  million in annual sales theres no way to know what market share they will eventually capture sales should be ramping up as a result of breaking through the barriers and everyone including management will be anxious to see the results come in the three recent national agreements are certainly a good sign for biolargos commercial future there appear to be a few big competitors in the industrial odor control market like prosweet by general electric ge and versene by dow chemical dow but apparently none perform like cupridyne® clean with all the excitement surrounding these recent developments calvert was quick to point out in a recent meeting at ld micro that odornomores continued success in this market will require careful attention to product support and customer service calvert added we love our customers we offer exceptional service and our cupridyne clean industrial odor eliminator actually works legal disclaimer except for the historical

technologies biolargo inc focuses on products that improve quality of life ceocfo magazine interview dennis p calvert president chief executive officer and chairman of the board biolargo inc  otcqb blgo wwwbiolargocom interview conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfo magazine published – june   ceocfo mr calvert the biolargo tagline is “we make life better” would you tell us how you do that mr calvert the company has been inventing technologies and products for about ten years our primary focus is in the areas of clean water clean air and advanced healthcare our technologies were all designed and developed with the singular goal to improve quality of life in some way in their respective field and we believe they are all technical breakthroughs that can improve quality of life in many areas and for many people ceocfo how do you decide what to bring into the fold mr calvert we work hard to focus on important technical advances that are purposeful and valuable to make life better we only invest in products that have the potential to become known as the  technical performer in their respective markets however innovation does involve risk in order to pick winning opportunities the first thing we do is conduct substantial market research to look for areas or challenges that are not wellserved by existing products or technologies secondly we look for margins – a place where innovation can be awarded so that as you find market traction there are sufficient margins to pull and drive the risk and cost of innovation because the rd budget and time commitment to develop these products is very significant additionally we are also coming into crowded marketplaces typically dominated by very large companies so we look for the area in which we can find access to the market whether by relationship or distribution channel or through a partnership our motto for our development cycle is that we invent we prove and we partner at the end of the day most of the market adoption that we enjoy is through partnerships with companies and people that already serve wellestablished marketplaces ceocfo would you tell us about the products that you have available now mr calvert our advanced water treatment technology is called aos advanced oxidation system and the research and development work for this product has now received approximately thirtyfive grants it is in the alpha prototype stage and heading into beta stage and was developed in conjunction with a number of industry leaders and researchers at the university of alberta the aos represents a technical leap forward in the way we can treat contaminated water and its primary value proposition is that it performs superior disinfection and decontamination with an emphasis on soluble organics the remarkable characteristic that gets everyone’s attention is its highly efficient performance and incredibly low electricity consumption which translates to low cost its technical efficacy is now proven and we are now heading into the scaleup and engineering effort for large scale commercial uses ceocfo how does aos work mr calvert the discovery is that we can take low levels of electrical energy and combine it with an oxidant iodine at a low dose in a special carbon bed resulting in highly efficient water disinfectiondecontamination because of the way our system is configured we actually generate what is called “superoxides” which are incredibly highenergy oxidative molecules across the length of a filter apparatus made of carbon materials the key to our discovery is that we can generate superoxides while requiring incredibly low electrical energy levels and the oxidation potential we generate is an order of magnitude higher than was previously known possible with electrochemical systems  ceocfo how is this used mr calvert the water industry is a behemoth at approximately  billion annually in principle our technology could have application in just about every sector of the water industry our focus at the moment is on picking the market where we believe we can win and where there are margins that sufficiently award innovation and where we have relationships and access to the marketplace we are focused right now in the food and beverage sector with an emphasis on processing wastewater in this application it’s an incredibly difficult technical and costly challenge to clean up contaminated wastewater and the food and beverage industry is facing increasing pressure to deal with their waste streams existing water treatment platforms are not serving this market need sufficiently which spurred us to focus our efforts in this area we have a number of relationships in this industry in fact our research center is located at agrifood discovery place at the university of alberta as a result of those key relationships we have access to expertise potential customers collaborators and leading researchers while this area is our first focus we believe eventually that our technology will find its way into just about every segment of the water market  ceocfo what else is going on at biolargo mr calvert we have two other key product lines one is our industrial odor control product cupridyne clean which is now finding rapid adoption in the waste handling and wastewater treatment industries we recently signed three national contracts with leading companies that serve the waste industry and we believe we are going to get all the major industry leaders in this application we are delivering liquid chemistry to solve odor control challenges through misting systems and also water delivery systems like water trucks and spray apparatuses cupridyne clean is being used to oxidize odorous compounds that are the natural byproduct of waste but that cause the waste handling industry substantial grief these compounds include ammonia and hs and other sulphur compounds as well as mercaptans and fatty acids waste handling and wastewater treatment facilities are a primary target and we have chosen to target national corporate accounts we have secured three national contracts in the last six weeks the product is effective safe easy to use and affordable we believe we are going to land contracts with all of the industry leaders ceocfo why is now the time mr calvert cupridyne clean was first launched in may of  and the science was first developed and refined for consumer product applications our consumer products won all sorts of praise and acclaim including four “product of the year awards” in the pet and companion animal industry but those consumer products have not yet found a meaningful channel for distribution about a year and a half ago as a result of my relationship as board member of sustainocorg an industry trade group based in southern california we had a chance to meet one of the regional vice presidents at one of the largest waste handling companies in the world he urged us to consider taking the technology into a development cycle to serve the national waste handling industry which is commonly referred to as industrial odor control that led to trials which were exceptional and we were even congratulated as having a “revolutionary” technological advance for the waste handling industry – this was a little over a year ago since then we have invested in becoming familiar with and learning that industry working with top management and developing both topdown and bottomup marketing strategies cupridyne has been serving the industrial odor control industry in the field for about a year now and we just have recently broken through a significant barrier to entry by securing those national accounts and now we’re selling product to many of the largest companies in the waste handling industry ceocfo do you have a third area of focus mr calvert one of our technologies is organized in a subsidiary named clyra medical technologies and it is focused on developing and commercializing a series of advanced wound care products in that company we recently brought in a strategic investor who invested about  million over the past year we then invested to recruit the best talent possible –  leaders from the industry and wellentrenched specialists – to develop a series of advanced wound care products as a result of all that work we believe we will be making fda applications under k in the next few weeks for the first of these products we believe these advanced wound care products will be highly disruptive for a very large important and urgent need in the advanced wound care field  ceocfo why has it been so hard to find a way to treat chronic wounds mr calvert chronic infected wounds are often the result of suppressed immune systems and typically occur with senior citizens who commonly suffer from poor circulation andor diabetes the nature of these wounds makes them extremely difficult to manage when it comes to treating and healing those wounds the industry is continually seeking new and improved technical solutions silver compounds historically had the largest market share however these compounds are coming under increased scrutiny for their potential to cause microbial resistance and as one might imagine they can be very expensive there are a number of iodinebased products that have done well but the traditional iodine products on the market are often considered cytotoxic and they often cause staining and are difficult to work with they are quite effective as disinfectants but they also had a potential to cause tissue damage and in some cases inhibit scar formation physicians and patients have therefore been forced to accept side effects for the sake of efficacy these dynamics and the obvious need for improvement create a market gap for an antimicrobial strategy with no known acquired resistance that is gentle and at the same time helps promote rapid healing this is where our clyra medical technologies will shine our products are proven effective in the disinfection of a broad array of pathogens and include ingredients that are naturally accepted by the body and have wellestablished metabolic pathways we have successfully passed the required cytotox and sensitivity testing we also believe some of our ingredients will be highly effective in helping the body form scar tissue we also have evidence to support their potential role to help manage biofilms the combination of all these features gives our subsidiary clyra medical technologies a significant competitive edge in a highly competitive and highly technical market there is a market gap and we intend to fill that gap with these products ceocfo what are the challenges as ceo with so much happening at one time mr calvert in each of these product lines we have actually formed companies and recruited specialists to guide us as we fully develop these technical products and platforms we invent prove and partner in all of these situations we believe the ultimate outcome will be for these products to find their way into partnerships by licensing and joint venturing we are exceptionally good at the inventing and proving side however it would be difficult to manage the full execution of all of these products to a fullscale commercial level for example if we look at our wound care technology it presents itself into a perfect spinoff into its own company and we intend to pursue that when it is ready in other situations like our industrial odor control product we are taking the product directly to market through our wholly owned subsidiary odornomore the water technology is so big that we believe multiple partnerships will present themselves across the various industry segments  ceocfo what has changed in your approach over time mr calvert over time we have become increasingly more discerning and selective as to where we choose to invest our time energy and money we seek opportunities where we can succeed and where there is a previously unidentified solution to a problem over time we have become highly skilled at that as a result of the refinements and technical advances we are finding success we know that proper capitalization and finding the right talent are ever so critical we are becoming increasingly skilled at making sure that both of those key pieces of the puzzle are in place to execute a successful commercial strategy relative to the opportunities in the general marketplace we see problems associated with microbial control increasing urbanization consolidation of industry and so on if you think of it at the highest level and look at the nature of air and water and healthcare they all face problems that are a direct result of concentration and vacuums – this idea that with highly industrialized waste streams highly concentrated urban density we often overload the system with microbial threats and the problems require technological innovation to overcome them efficiently and cost effectively ceocfo has the investment community been paying attention mr calvert we have a significant group of investors that have supported our business our total invested capital is about  million since we began this journey in  we are beginning to capture earlystage institutional investor’s attention and we are anxious to take the company into a national market when ready we also are now at the point where we are finding commercial traction in very large markets with substantial upside that is new and certainly increases our exposure our company has an important piece of the puzzle to help make life better in a few of the most critical markets known water air and healthcare the marketplace has not fully recognized that yet but it will ceocfo what might be missed about biolargo at first look mr calvert as a science and technologybased company it is difficult for the average onlooker to fully appreciate the significance of our technical advances it takes discernment and digging in when people dig deep they tend to be  quite astonished the innovation behind biolargo is the culmination of our founder and chief science officer ken code’s life’s work i can’t imagine a more meaningful legacy everything that we do represents a significant technical leap forward and that is not necessarily easy to identify for the average investor as a result unfortunately many investors might wait for commercial success those who recognize the significance of our technical advances often become our investors as hard as it might be to pick a winner before commercial success is fully realized we know that biolargo’s sustainable technologies will become recognized around the world to help make life better as we deliver clean water clean air and advanced healthcare as the low cost and high impact solution provider of course we remind everyone to study our annual report and quarterly report’s at wwwsecgov for complete disclosure the various risk factors and financial condition of the company as they evaluate our business link to web posting at ceocfo interviews posted by biolargo at  no comments wednesday  june  biolargo subsidiary odornomore signs national purchasing agreement with waste industries usa more great news this week as biolargo subsidiary odornomore announced that the company had signed a national purchasing agreement with another top  us waste handling company waste industries usa for odornomores cupridyne clean industrial odor control solution wwwcupridynecom odornomore put out a press release on waste advantage announcing this contract where waste industries purchasing manager josh thompson was quoted a number of our sites tested odornomore’s products and the results were remarkable not only did they like the product they were impressed with the quality of service from the company cupridyne clean makes it cleaner   for more info read the press release on waste advantage posted by biolargo at  no comments tuesday  june  president and ceo’s report of biolargo  annual stockholders’ meeting dear biolargo stockholders we had a great meeting yesterday june th at our corporate offices in westminster california if you were unable to attend we missed you and we encourage you to attend in the future of course we also encourage you to reach out to us anytime to discuss our status and progress it was so good to reconnect with old friends and share our team’s enthusiasm for biolargo and our mission to make life better  the business of the meeting was successfully accomplished all recommendations presented to the stockholders were approved during a discussion of business progress we provided insights about a series of important commercial milestones and helped explain why we believe the future remains so bright for biolargo here are a few highlights  jack b “jay” strommen has officially joined our board of directors  he plays a critical role with biolargo as an investor partner and financier of our subsidiary clyra medical technologies he is a winner and a strong addition to our team and on behalf of the company we thank him for his hard work  we want to take a moment to thank gary cox for his years of dedicated service as a board member at biolargo that ended yesterday we look forward to pursuing new business relationships together in the future  we reviewed our presentation given at the th annual ld micro invitational conference on june   linked here which provided a comprehensive overview of our progress our milestones and our near term and long term goals  we shared the news linked here about our increasing sales of our cupridyne clean industrial odor control products  nd that we expect these sales to continue to increase due to the very recent execution of “national purchasing agreements” with two of the top  waste handling companies in the industry as previously announced providing us vendor status that allows us to sell to the local facilities of these large companies we also shared new information that we have just entered into a similar contractual relationship with another top industry member we are now servicing three of the top  companies in the waste handling industry these agreements demonstrate that we are breaking through the significant barrierstoentry for this market and are a testimony to the nowrecognized superior quality of our products as well as the continuing commitment of the team at our subsidiary odornomore inc to support these very important customers as our satisfied customers say “finally an industrial odor control product that actually works” stay tuned for more information as we advance sales  we enjoyed an update from mr steve harrison president of our subsidiary clyra medical technologies on his plan to file a k application with the fda very soon with the support of a  million investment from the strommen family made over the past year we were able to develop an advanced wound care product for topical use on chronic infected wounds and a dental product that can help patients avoid postsurgical infections we believe these two products set the stage to build a portfolio of products to serve these important markets mr harrison reported that the first public presentation about our products will be made later this week at the annual wound healing science and industry conference woundhsi sponsored by the peter sheehan diabetes care foundation httpwwwwoundhsiorg our products will be highlighted in a presentation by a leading professional in the field dr brock a liden dpm titled antiinfective and biofilm therapy  we updated the attendees on the advancing discussions with potential engineering scaleup partners potential commercial partners and public funding sources for our aos clean water technology as you may recall we have proven the science behind the aos and have developed its water disinfection and decontamination thoroughly in the lab we are now heading from the “alpha” prototype to a “beta” prototype and subsequently to commercialization the science of this technology is advancing and gaining international acclaim and we look forward to sharing more details as we prepare for our rd annual technical symposium in august before i close i want to take a moment to remember one our original team members mr jeffrey wallace who recently passed away jeff was critical part of the early days of organizing biolargo into what it has become today he was a great man that invested his life serving others as a man of integrity he mentored more than  eagle scouts in the boy scouts of america program and he left a lasting mark in this world for all things good and right we will miss jeff and pray for his family in their loss amen  is the breakthrough year for biolargo and we are thankful for your continued support

industry with industrial odor control product – cupridyne® clean skip to main  skip to sidebar tuesday  june  biolargos odornomore to revolutionize waste handling industry with industrial odor control product – cupridyne® clean “finally an industrial odor control product that actually works” by tamarack advisers for the original article by tamarack advisers go here anyone who’s taken the trash out to the garbage cans knows that trash smells and we’re thankful when the trash truck comes by once a week to collect it the waste handling industry which exceeds  billion annually in the us makes our smelly trash and sewage “go away” without us giving it a second thought while our trash and sewage seems to magically disappear from our lives we know it has to end up somewhere this “somewhere” is usually a landfill or wastewater treatment plant and more recently with new laws and regulations a composting or recycling facility on the way there our trash passes through a “transfer station” probably not far from where you live these facilities – transfer stations landfills wastewater treatment plants and the like  harbor some of the more putrescent odors on the planet in fact with increasing urbanization and population growth many us neighborhoods are close enough to these facilities to be impacted by these strong farreaching odors resulting in frequent complaints regulatory violations and litigation  according to waste the leading information event commerce and education provider to the solid waste recycling organics industries “a survey reveals that odors continue to trouble the solid waste industry” and “odor has even been referred to as the achilles heel of composting” from httpswwwpexelscomsearchlandfill foul odors are a natural result of decomposing organic material that is a major constituent in trash and sewage common problematic odorcausing compounds found in such material include hydrogen sulfide hs that smells like rotten eggs ammonia nh that smells like a cat litter box fatty acids mercaptans and other malodors including volatile organic compounds to combat regulatory violations and neighbor lawsuits the waste handling industry has historically relied on odor control products that use strong fragrances eg citrus or cherry to try to overpower unpleasant odors some companies have installed expensive covers and enclosures to mitigate the negative impact of odors on their neighbors but while solutions like these have historically been considered the “best available” these old strategies do not go to the root of the problem – the odorcausing compounds themselves – and therefore tend to fail while some enzymebased solutions do eliminate some odorcausing compounds they often have a limited range of activity and can take a while to work the industry has operated so long without a suitable technical solution that they are understandably skeptical when a new product emerges with claims that it actually dismantles and eliminates the odor causing elements however one newcomer to the industry is now gaining traction and awareness of its odorelimination claims… cupridyne clean finding welcome market word is spreading in the waste services industry that biolargo’s cupridyne clean is the only industrial odor control product that actually eliminates foul odors by oxidizing the compounds that cause them while remaining safe easy to use and affordable just a few weeks ago biolargo inc otcqb blgo announced that its subsidiary odornomore had signed a “national purchasing agreement” npa with one of the largest solid waste and recycling companies in north america to be able to provide them with their revolutionary odor control product cupridyne clean additional details were highlighted in a trade press release by waste just weeks later the company reported that it had signed its second top  waste industry company to an npa management recently reported in an interview by uptick newswire that more contracts with leading companies are in the works and sales had started to grow in a special waste report joseph provenzano president of biolargo’s odornomore division explained “cupridyne clean oxidizes all volatile organic compounds vocs amines sulfur compounds fatty acids and mercaptans prevalent at sites that process organics our products are broad spectrum and work indiscriminately on all organically derived odors they eliminate odors rather than cover them most other industry products use fragrance to mask odors often exacerbating the problem our products are not masking agents rather this green technology breaks down odorous compounds through oxidation odor reduction is immediate and it is safe” the waste special report adds “odornomore’s patented product line features cupridyne clean an odor control solution tailored to integrate within a site’s operations whether it is a landfill composting facility materials recovery facility mrf transfer station or wastewater treatment plant scientificallyproven and ecofriendly cupridyne clean can be dispensed through misting systems portable sprayers andor water trucks to accommodate current infrastructure each available in varied sizes” in the article “biolargo subsidiary odornomore finds welcome market executes national purchasing agreement with leading waste and recycling service company”  dennis p calvert president and ceo of biolargo commented our claim that cupridyne clean is the top performing safe and sustainable odor control product in the waste industry today continues to be supported by our performance trials and sales with leading waste handing companies  our start in this industry was a pretty humble beginning we made a key contact through sustainoc a regional trade association in southern california where we serve on the board with industry business leaders a regional executive from one of the biggest companies in the world requested that we develop a product for this industry and later witnessed our first onsite trail to validate its performance  having witnessed the results he turned to our team offered a handshake and commented ‘congratulations you are going to revolutionize the wastehandling industry’  to offer some temper to our enthusiasm as great as that prediction sounds we then had to set about the task building out the product line developing infrastructure performance data a marketing campaign and delivery processes to support this enormous and demanding industry that work continues having broken through a major barrier to entry our national purchasing agreements designate us as an approved vendor and allows us to initiate sales and service efforts to all of their operations without any formal guarantee of purchase volumes we have much work to do to support this and every other opportunity like this as we serve our important and valuable customers stay tuned to watch us build our business cupridyne will compete with a large number of vendors providing strong fragrance masking solutions and traditional enzymebased industrial odor control products offered by ge nyse ge and dow chemical company nyse dow ge offers prosweet odor solutions and dow offers versene unmanageable odors can be a public relations nightmare for waste industry operators in an industry that did not believe there was a solution that can actually eliminate troublesome systemic odors finding an industrial odor control product that actually works sounds… ‘revolutionary’ biolargo is certainly a company to watch it is a science and technology company with multiple irons in the

magazine   developing clean water clean air and advanced wound care technologies biolargo inc focuses on products that improve quality of life     dennis p calvert president chief executive officer and chairman of the board   biolargo inc otcqb blgo wwwbiolargocom   interview conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfo magazine published � june     ceocfo mr calvert the biolargo tagline is �we make life better� would you tell us how you do that mr calvert the company has been inventing technologies and products for about ten years our primary focus is in the areas of clean water clean air and advanced healthcare our technologies were all designed and developed with the singular goal to improve quality of life in some way in their respective field and we believe they are all technical breakthroughs that can improve quality of life in many areas and for many people   ceocfo how do you decide what to bring into the fold mr calvert we work hard to focus on important technical advances that are purposeful and valuable to make life better we only invest in products that have the potential to become known as the  technical performer in their respective markets however innovation does involve risk in order to pick winning opportunities the first thing we do is conduct substantial market research to look for areas or challenges that are not wellserved by existing products or technologies secondly we look for margins � a place where innovation can be awarded so that as you find market traction there are sufficient margins to pull and drive the risk and cost of innovation because the rd budget and time commitment to develop these products is very significant additionally we are also coming into crowded marketplaces typically dominated by very large companies so we look for the area in which we can find access to the market whether by relationship or distribution channel or through a partnership our motto for our development cycle is that we invent we prove and we partner at the end of the day most of the market adoption that we enjoy is through partnerships with companies and people that already serve wellestablished marketplaces   ceocfo would you tell us about the products that you have available now mr calvert our advanced water treatment technology is called aos advanced oxidation system and the research and development work for this product has now received approximately thirtyfive grants it is in the alpha prototype stage and heading into beta stage and was developed in conjunction with a number of industry leaders and researchers at the university of alberta the aos represents a technical leap forward in the way we can treat contaminated water and its primary value proposition is that it performs superior disinfection and decontamination with an emphasis on soluble organics the remarkable characteristic that gets everyone�s attention is its highly efficient performance and incredibly low electricity consumption which translates to low cost its technical efficacy is now proven and we are now heading into the scaleup and engineering effort for large scale commercial uses   ceocfo how does aos work mr calvert the discovery is that we can take low levels of electrical energy and combine it with an oxidant iodine at a low dose in a special carbon bed resulting in highly efficient water disinfectiondecontamination because of the way our system is configured we actually generate what is called �superoxides� which are incredibly highenergy oxidative molecules across the length of a filter apparatus made of carbon materials the key to our discovery is that we can generate superoxides while requiring incredibly low electrical energy levels and the oxidation potential we generate is an order of magnitude higher than was previously known possible with electrochemical systems   ceocfo how is this used mr calvert the water industry is a behemoth at approximately  billion annually in principle our technology could have application in just about every sector of the water industry our focus at the moment is on picking the market where we believe we can win and where there are margins that sufficiently award innovation and where we have relationships and access to the marketplace we are focused right now in the food and beverage sector with an emphasis on processing wastewater in this application it�s an incredibly difficult technical and costly challenge to clean up contaminated wastewater and the food and beverage industry is facing increasing pressure to deal with their waste streams existing water treatment platforms are not serving this market need sufficiently which spurred us to focus our efforts in this area we have a number of relationships in this industry in fact our research center is located at agrifood discovery place at the university of alberta as a result of those key relationships we have access to expertise potential customers collaborators and leading researchers while this area is our first focus we believe eventually that our technology will find its way into just about every segment of the water market   ceocfo what else is going on at biolargo mr calvert we have two other key product lines one is our industrial odor control product cupridyne clean which is now finding rapid adoption in the waste handling and wastewater treatment industries we recently signed three national contracts with leading companies that serve the waste industry and we believe we are going to get all the major industry leaders in this application we are delivering liquid chemistry to solve odor control challenges through misting systems and also water delivery systems like water trucks and spray apparatuses cupridyne clean is being used to oxidize odorous compounds that are the natural byproduct of waste but that cause the waste handling industry substantial grief these compounds include ammonia and hs and other sulphur compounds as well as mercaptans and fatty acids waste handling and wastewater treatment facilities are a primary target and we have chosen to target national corporate accounts we have secured three national contracts in the last six weeks the product is effective safe easy to use and affordable we believe we are going to land contracts with all of the industry leaders   ceocfo why is now the time mr calvert cupridyne clean was first launched in may of  and the science was first developed and refined for consumer product applications our consumer products won all sorts of praise and acclaim including four �product of the year awards� in the pet and companion animal industry but those consumer products have not yet found a meaningful channel for distribution about a year and a half ago as a result of my relationship as board member of sustainocorg an industry trade group based in southern california we had a chance to meet one of the regional vice presidents at one of the largest waste handling companies in the world he urged us to consider taking the technology into a development cycle to serve the national waste handling industry which is commonly referred to as industrial odor control that led to trials which were exceptional and we were even congratulated as having a �revolutionary� technological advance for the waste handling industry � this was a little over a year ago since then we have invested in becoming familiar with and learning that industry working with top management and developing both topdown and bottomup marketing strategies cupridyne has been serving the industrial odor control industry in the field for about a year now and we just have recently broken through a significant barrier to entry by securing those national accounts and now we�re selling product to many of the largest companies in the waste handling industry   ceocfo do you have a third area of focus mr calvert one of our technologies is organized in a subsidiary named clyra medical technologies and it is focused on developing and commercializing a series of advanced wound care products in that company we recently brought in a strategic investor who invested about  million over the past year we then invested to recruit the best talent possible �  leaders from the industry and wellentrenched specialists � to develop a series of advanced wound care products as a result of all that work we believe we will be making fda applications under k in the next few weeks for the first of these products we believe these advanced wound care products will be highly disruptive for a very large important and urgent need in the advanced wound care field   ceocfo why has it been so hard to find a way to treat chronic wounds mr calvert chronic infected wounds are often the result of suppressed immune systems and typically occur with senior citizens who commonly suffer from poor circulation andor diabetes the nature of these wounds makes them simply extremely difficult to manage when it comes to treating and healing those wounds the industry is continually seeking new and improved technical solutions silver compounds historically had the largest market share however these compounds are coming under increased scrutiny for their potential to cause microbial resistance and as one might imagine they can be very expensive there are a number of iodinebased products that have done well but the traditional iodine products on the market are often considered cytotoxic and they often cause staining and are difficult to work with they are quite effective as disinfectants but they also had a potential to cause tissue damage and in some cases inhibit scar formation physicians and patients have therefore been forced to accept side effects for the sake of efficacy these dynamics and the obvious need for improvement create a market gap for an antimicrobial strategy with no known acquired resistance that is gentle and at the same time helps promote rapid healing this is where our clyra medical technologies will shine our products are proven effective in the disinfection of a broad array of pathogens and include ingredients that are naturally accepted by the body and have wellestablished metabolic pathways we have successfully passed the required cytotox and sensitivity testing we also believe some of our ingredients will be highly effective in helping the body form scar tissue we also have evidence to support their potential role to help manage biofilms the combination of all these features gives our subsidiary clyra medical technologies a significant competitive edge in a highly competitive and highly technical market there is a market gap and we intend to fill that gap with these products   ceocfo what are the challenges as ceo with so much happening at one time mr calvert in each of these product lines we have actually formed companies and recruited specialists to guide us as we fully develop these technical products and platforms we invent prove and partner in all of these situations we believe the ultimate outcome will be for these products to find their way into partnerships by licensing and joint venturing we are exceptionally good at the inventing and proving side however it would be difficult to manage the full execution of all of these products to a fullscale commercial level for example if we look at our wound care technology it presents itself into a perfect spinoff into its own company and we intend to pursue that when it is ready in other situations like our industrial odor control product we are taking the product directly to market through our wholly owned subsidiary odornomore the water technology is so big that we believe multiple partnerships will present themselves across the various industry segments   ceocfo what has changed in your approach over time mr calvert over time we have become increasingly more discerning and selective as to where we choose to invest our time energy and money we seek opportunities where we can succeed and where there is a previously unidentified solution to a problem over time we have become highly skilled at that as a result of the refinements and technical advances we are finding success we know that proper capitalization and finding the right talent are ever so critical we are becoming increasingly skilled at making sure that both of those key pieces of the puzzle are in place to execute a successful commercial strategy relative to the opportunities in the general marketplace we see problems associated with microbial control increasing urbanization consolidation of industry and so on if you think of it at the highest level and look at the nature of air and water and healthcare they all face problems that are a direct result of concentration and vacuums � this idea that with highly industrialized waste streams highly concentrated urban density we often overload the system with microbial threats and the problems require technological innovation to overcome them efficiently and cost effectively   ceocfo has the investment community been paying attention mr calvert we have a significant group of investors that have supported our business our total invested capital is about  million since we began this journey in  we are beginning to capture earlystage institutional investor�s attention and we are anxious to take the company into a national market when ready we also are now at the point where we are finding commercial traction in very large markets with substantial upside that is new and certainly increases our exposure our company has an important piece of the puzzle to help make life better in a few of the most critical markets known water air and healthcare the marketplace has not fully recognized that yet but it will   ceocfo what might be missed about biolargo at first look mr calvert as a science and technologybased company it is difficult for the average onlooker to fully appreciate the significance of our technical advances it takes discernment and digging in when people dig deep they tend to be  quite astonished the innovation behind biolargo is the culmination of our founder and chief science officer ken code�s life�s work i can�t imagine a more meaningful legacy everything that we do represents a significant technical leap forward and that is not necessarily easy to identify for the average investor as a result unfortunately many investors might wait for commercial success those who recognize the significance of our technical advances often become our investors as hard as it might be to pick a winner before commercial success is fully realized we know that biolargo�s sustainable technologies will become recognized around the world to help make life better as we deliver clean water clean air and advanced healthcare as the low cost and high impact solution provider   of course we remind everyone to study our annual report and quarterly report�s at wwwsecgov for complete disclosure the various risk factors and financial condition of the company as they evaluate our business   �biolargo�s sustainable technologies will become recognized around the

the ‘inventor’ entrusted with the biolargo technology began this journey of ours over  years ago when his father had a severe stroke and was left severely impaired bed ridden or wheel chair confined and in need of longterm convalescent care out of concern for his father’s great risk of secondary infection ken set out to find a way to extend his father’s life expectancy and improve his quality of life by reducing his risk of contracting disease and by reducing compounding risks of secondary infections that are so common in longterm care facilities through his scientific trials of blending low dose inorganic chemical compounds and absorbent materials he made what may just be called a “genuine discovery” when the biolargo technology is incorporated into products many of which are already widely known and in use those products become an effective tool in stopping the transmission of life threatening disease our purpose we help solve some of the world’s most important problems that threaten our water air food agriculture healthcare and energy by delivering products and services that feature our biolargo technology our innovative technologies deliver nature’s best solution free
