doubters  mit technology review sustainable energy khosla biofuel ipo draws doubters as yet another biofuels company prepares for a stock offering some wonder if the company is worthy of going public at all by antonio regalado may   in  a startup called nanosys tried to go public it had recruited some of the world’s top nanoscientists for its board and had bought up hundreds of nanotech patents the idea was that it could revolutionize tv displays batteries and maybe even golf balls it had no product but so what nanotech seemed like it could change everything future fuel kior’s demonstration facility just outside of houston texas produces up to  barrels of renewable crude oil per day from wood chips that is when a venture capitalist named vinod khosla then with kleiner perkins caufield  byers cried fraud a speech of khosla’s at stanford university helped to not only torpedo the nanosys ipo but also burst a shortlived nanotech bubble here’s what khosla said according to a thomson reuters publication at the time “personally i think it is the wrong model for a company and i think it is a shame that they are going public because i do not think they are in a position to be predictable enough and whether they are doing it knowingly or unknowingly there is a reasonable likelihood that they will defraud the public market” now khosla’s the one being questioned “i am looking at vinod khosla’s s filing of kior which has a grand total of zero  revenue” wrote venture capitalist larry bock in an email bock cofounded nanosys and was behind the aborted ipo “should vinod be kept accountable” for several years khosla ventures has been plowing money into greenenergy startups now khosla has begun cashing out by pushing some of his nextgeneration biofuels companies public recent khoslabacked biofuels ipos include amyris and gevo and now comes kior—a pasadena texas company that says it will turn wood chips into gasoline and diesel it expects to raise  million in its ipo all three companies are earlystage they’re still building plants and proving their ideas none have turned a profit kior may be the earlieststage yet its sec filing is long on powerpoint slogans “we drilled deep into the problem … not into our planet” but so far kior hasn’t sold a drop of fuel and cautions investors that “we have no experience producing renewable transportation fuels at the scale needed for the development of our business” the company says it is counting on a  billion loan guarantee from the us department of energy to build its plants bock now says he wants some “intellectual honesty” from his rival so technology review asked khosla whether prerevenue biofuels companies should be going public khosla sent back a detailed memo explaining why biofuels is not like nanotech here’s a summary existing markets biofuels are end applications with large markets not just technologies proven technology in many cases the manufacturing or yield of technology has been proven big payoffs the payback from success is huge that was not always true in biotech and nanotech where there is more risk from competitors in biofuels the markets are so huge that if  companies produced the same product each could be a billiondollar business without interfering with the others predictability if a company can give investors accurate expectations for the next two to three years then they can consider an ipo this is true of biofuels now but not of nanotech in  khosla’s main point is that the fuels market is gigantic whereas nanosys was all about technologies looking for problems to solve he argues that having interesting technology without a compelling market is not a good place to be as a business even nanosys’s current chief financial officer john page agrees with that “that is a fairly accurate assessment of where nanosys was in ” nanosys recently reorganized in an effort to generate more revenue from leds and batteries even so  kior is more of a business plan than a business and its biggest asset may be the khosla brand itself khosla ventures has put money in over  cleantech companies and raised over  billion for its latest investment fund for investors evaluating biofuel projects can be tricky everything depends on whether the technology succeeds in turning feedstock into fuel in an economical way kior estimates its own production costs for gasoline at around  a gallon but advanced biofuel companies are notorious for being overly optimistic on costs based on smallscale production another khosla company range fuels ran into trouble at the scaleup phase khosla says it’s up to investors to make the call about whether any company’s forecasts make sense “what you believe will determine the valuation you assign to a company and if you are optimistic you will get to frothy valuations and hence take on undue risk” he says so far investors aren’t complaining khosla has already notched two successes both amyris and gevo saw big jumps in their stock prices “those are good returns and that drives the market for more offerings” says sheeraz haji ceo of market analyst cleantech group “there is a belief that these are huge markets and that these companies are going to do well” pavel molchanov an analyst at financial services provider raymond james says there’s room for even more stock offerings “conceptually the market has signaled an openness to consider these companies i think the fact that we are talking about oil at  a barrel provides a very helpful market backdrop” he says “if oil was at  we wouldn’t be seeing these ipos” still it’s fair to wonder if the khosla ipo machine might overheat last year investors were not interested in the  million ipo plans of petroalgae another company with no revenue and shares of synthetic biology company codexis haven’t done well in addition to kior the fuelfromalgae company solazyme has now filed documents with the sec for a planned  million ipo solazyme doesn’t yet manufacture fuels economically but it’s launched a cosmetics business using its oils the nanotech crowd insists that this biofuels boom is hype driven by government subsidies sexy science and high oil costs josh wolfe a managing partner at lux capital where bock is also a venture investor argues that “biofuels will turn most investors into biofools some of these ipos are overpromoted and not good businesses for society it may turn out okay but investors will surely be left holding the bag” we put it to khosla—is there an ipo bubble in nextgeneration biofuels “i am sure a potential for a bubble exists and we should be careful” khosla says “whenever quick money can be made you will see bubbles form” the original version of this article contained an anonymous quote that didn’t meet technology

morning at  am the hall was full and overflowing in a city like bangalore known for traffic snarls taj vivanta outside the city still attracted enthusiastic product tech crowd the reason was obvious when vinod khosla the celebrated silicon valley vc and legendary entrepreneur cofounder of sun microsystems is giving a keynote it is a mustpresent meeting rajendra s pawar chairman of nasscom predicted earlier that software and hardware contribution would be on the order of  billion in  up from  billion nowexpert opinion doesn’t lead to testing a big ideavinod khosla made an unconventional opening stating that with risk taking comes failure and therefore he asked entrepreneurs to reject punditry and expert wisdom so that they are not caged by impossibility mindset he said that large shifts happen without any precedent and historical trends should be disregarded when embarking upon an idea some of the expert predictions such as att’s wisdom that telephones are not great devices for communication flying was impossible or bad forecast of oil prices in  for  have all been proved wrong seconding rajendra s pawar’s prediction about the size of hardware and software contribution khosla said “we can drive the economy to make it big” he quoted bernard shaw in his presentation “all progress depends upon unreasonable man” he predicted that technology will lead the economyif we need to invent the future we want experts should be ignored and past should not extrapolated by challenging conventions any idea can succeed extrapolating past is an exercise in futility according to khosla who quoted mckinsey’s prediction of under a million mobile phones by  whereas the actual number by  was  million prof tetlock of stanford university has written about folly of predictions and khosla quoted him as saying “experts are poor forecasters than dartthrowing monkeys” cool dozenvinod khosla proposed  cool ideas called “cool dozen” in the retail consumer market that are worth taking note for new product ventures the rate at which change is happening will be fast thanks to rapid changes in the postpc era the dozen areas are data reduction big data analysis emotion education tv  social next interest graph nfc democratization of publishing utility health marketplacehe listed companies in each area that have the potential to grow big he referred to interview street now a

huge change as well as marketplaces and payment modes uidai of the government of india is yet another massive project of a kind not undertaken so far nfcqruidai is a huge combination providing huge opportunitiesrisk taking and failing“only those who fail greatly can achieve greatly” said jf kennedy taking a cue from that statement vinod khosla said “my willingness to fail gives me the ability to succeed” when you embark on an idea not explored before the probability of failure is high and that should not be a deterring force for you to not pursue that idea “you can lose only x of money” said khosla encouraging entrepreneurs to “do what you love and are passionate about” you wouldn’t abandon your religion if your religion is your product opinioned khosla he said risktaking needs a courageous mind in addition to guts and premature confidence irreverence and rulebreaking are not wrong but “the best way to win a game is by making your own rules” concluded khosla it was an hour of

prev next i spoke to vinod khosla cofounder of sun microsystems who has run his own venture capital firm khosla ventures since  following nearly two decades at vc firm kleiner perkins his highestprofile investments have lately been in clean tech woodbased biofuel new types of batteries and water purification he studied engineering in india then at age  tried and failed to start a soymilk company khosla moved to the us got a stanford mba then cofounded sun microsystems in  in september  a judge ruled that khosla must let the public access his private beach near half moon bay in california in the following brief interview khosla talks about what makes a startup successful how employees can best collaborate the scalability issues that occur and what most companies get wrong when it comes to operating a business dan schawbel can you tell me what was different between those startups that worked and didn’t work out and specifically what was different operationally vinod khosla the biggest mistake i see entrepreneurs make is not knowing what they don’t know that leads startups to focus on the wrong incentives ask the wrong questions and over the long run they are unable to remove the key risks and build a large sustainable business  that being said i wouldn’t discount the impact of luck and timing for startups they both play a large role and assuming otherwise is folly often the single biggest differentiator of success is the founder and their entrepreneurial skills their clarity of vision their focus on only what is critical on their leadership and their persistence and openness to learning schawbel assuming you’ve hired the right people how do you get them to collaborate efficiently especially if distributed khosla that first assumption is the most important part though so i would like to focus there hiring the right and the best people is incredibly difficult to do and very few startups get this exactly right i firmly believe a company becomes the people it hires and a lot of the other pieces including collaboration distributed teams etc will work themselves out with a great team a great startup team is resourceful and willing to iterate and experiment on all things not just their product  business model but also their internal collaboration having said that it is the ceo’s job to provide leadership and ensure that the team operates as a team and has shared and aligned goals at khosla ventures we spend a lot of time focused on working with entrepreneurs to develop the right “gene pool” as we like to call it in fact we have a whole section on our website dedicated to team building for startups or gene pool engineering schawbel what scalability issues occur after the first hundred employees are hired khosla as a company scales by default more structure will need to be added to keep a well functioning organization this naturally could lead to increased collaboration problems hierarchy issues politics etc you need process but you cannot let process win over entrepreneurial culture i would rather have too little management than too much to keep a company thinking like a startup building out your gene pool with the same principles as before is important for example scott cook talked about a direction change at intuit for middle managers as “guiding experimentation” rather than “managing projects” schawbel how do you know what types of functions to build out in an organization as it scales khosla “you cannot you have to assume plans will change and build teams with that flexibility in mind planning is important to understand the quality of thinking of a team and to have them consider all the factors that affect a business but as the thing to meet at all costs it is mythical targets sometimes i see companies meet plans at the expense of building real value on what will make them successful in the long run” schawbel what do most companies get wrong when it comes to business operations khosla going back to the beginning – companies tend to have blind spots because they don’t’ know what they don’t know it’s impossible to completely correct for but missing those critical questions can lead to problems in recruiting team building which can manifest years later sales strategy product building etc there are many tactical and strategic issues that different companies can get wrong eg scale before productmarket fit solve a problem no one will pay for etc but those typically are manifestations of the original issue i am always surprised how many organizations know what they are doing but have not formally and critically asked why they are doing it and is that the most efficient thing to do related posts  principles of scaling a business and still have a life
